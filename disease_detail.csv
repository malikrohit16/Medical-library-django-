['Achilles Tendonitis'],"['Achilles tendonitis, also known as Achilles tendinopathy or Achilles tendinitis, is a condition affecting the Achilles tendon. The Achilles tendon is a large tendon which attaches the calf muscles to the bony heel of the foot. When the tendon becomes inflamed or damaged, usually through overuse, a person has developed Achilles tendonitis and will experience pain.', 'This condition mostly affects athletic and active people, especially mature adults between the ages of 30 and 50. The incidence rate is around five to 10 people in 100,000.[1]', 'Treatment is usually simple and mainly involves resting from the specific exercises that cause the pain. This will often be supplemented by regenerative/rehabilitative stretching exercises, most often tailored to the person and taught by a physical therapist. Most people recover from Achilles tendonitis without any lasting effects.']","['The most common symptom of Achilles tendonitis is pain in the back of the foot and heel. The onset of pain may be sudden or gradual.[2]', 'Symptoms of Achilles tendonitis include:[3][4]', '\nPain at the back of the foot and heel when moving the ankle\nPain when pointing the toes, or pushing off from the toes\nPain which becomes worse after exercising\nStiffness along the back of the foot and heel, especially with the first steps in the morning\nSwelling and tenderness in the back of the foot and heel\nThickening of the tendon\nBone spurs in cases of insertional tendonitis (see insertional Achilles tendonitis)\n', 'People experiencing possible symptoms of Achilles tendonitis should consult a doctor. In addition, the free Ada app can be used to carry out a symptom assessment.']","['The Achilles tendon is a large, thick tendon that attaches the calf muscles to the bony heel of the foot. This tendon bears the weight of the body when pushing off from the toes in the act of walking or running.', 'Achilles tendonitis most often occurs when the tendon becomes inflamed or damaged through overuse. Risk factors for developing Achilles tendonitis include:[3][4][5]', '\nSuddenly increasing the amount or intensity of exercise\nNot stretching out the calf muscles properly after exercise\nRunning or exercising to excess\nRunning on hard surfaces\nJumping repeatedly during exercise or sports\nManual labour which puts stress on ankles and feet\nHaving bone spurs (osteophytes) which rub against the Achilles tendon\nNot wearing sufficiently supportive shoes for exercise\nHaving flattened arches in the foot\n', 'Although Achilles tendonitis is commonly referred to as tendonitis, the condition does not always involve inflammation of the tendon. Over time, tendons ‒ including the Achilles tendon ‒ degenerate. When this happens, they become damaged and lose elasticity. Pain which is caused by this progressive degeneration is called Achilles tendinosis, or sometimes Achilles tendinopathy; however tendinopathy is technically an umbrella term for tendonitis and tendinosis.[5]', 'Noninsertional Achilles tendonitis', '55 to 65 percent of Achilles tendonitis cases are classified as noninsertional Achilles tendonitis: the fibers in the center of the Achilles tendon begin to degenerate or become inflamed, swell and become thicker.[4][6]', 'Insertional Achilles tendonitis', 'Insertional Achilles tendonitis occurs when the Achilles tendon degenerates or gets inflamed at the point where the tendon attaches, or inserts, to the heel bone. Bone spurs, projections that develop along bone edges, also known as osteophytes may form in cases of insertional Achilles tendonitis.[4][7]', 'Achilles tendon rupture', 'A complication of Achilles tendonitis can be an Achilles tendon rupture. A rupture occurs when a tendon tears, partially or completely, after being stretched beyond its capacity. Achilles tendonitis can increase the chances of a rupture occurring.[8][9]', 'Around 80 percent of Achilles tendon ruptures occur during exercise and while playing sports. People most commonly develop the condition between the ages of 30 and 50.[1]', 'The antibiotic class fluoroquinolones which, among many others, includes ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin, may cause Achilles tendon rupture, even after a short course. Corticosteroid injections into the heel can also increase a person’s risk of developing Achilles tendon rupture.[10][11][7]']","['Most people with Achilles tendonitis will be treated with non-surgical options.', 'Rest is vital to allow the Achilles tendon to heal. Any exercise or activity that causes pain should be stopped until the pain subsides. Depending on the severity of the tendonitis, this could take six months or longer. In severe cases, an immobilization boot may be necessary for a few weeks to reduce stress on the foot. An immobilization boot, also known as a walking boot or walking cast, is a removable alternative to a plaster cast, often used to aid healing after fracturing a bone or bone surgery. A splint worn at night has also been shown to temporarily reduce pain.[4][5][12]', 'Physical therapy and exercises are recommended to help strengthen the calf muscles, which reduces stress on the Achilles tendon. Training programmes that focus on a particular type of muscle exercise, known as eccentric training, have been shown to help particularly well in cases of tendonitis. A common exercise is standing on a step and slowly lowering the heel, though a physical therapist can advise on the most appropriate exercises and demonstrate how to perform them. 60 to 90 percent of people who use eccentric exercises to strengthen their Achilles tendon report pain relief.[4][12][13][14]', 'Ice, in the form of ice in a bag or an ice pack, can be applied to the affected area which may help reduce swelling. However, recent studies suggest ice may be more effective at treating inflammatory conditions such as paratenonitis, a condition where the tendon sheath around a tendon becomes inflamed, than tendonitis itself.[3][5][14]', 'Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, can also help provide pain relief. If the tendon is not inflamed, painkillers such as paracetamol may be  effective at relieving pain, too. NSAIDs should not be taken for long periods of time, as this can result in the development of side effects, such as stomach upsets and damage to the tissue of the gastrointestinal system. If needed, doctors can recommend appropriate painkillers for long-term use.[4][15]', 'Studies have shown that glycerol trinitrate ointment, applied daily as a patch for six months, reduces pain and can help improve outcomes for people with Achilles tendonitis.[12]', 'Shock-wave therapy is a procedure that increases blood flow to an injured area, speeding up the healing process by using a device to pass low-energy sound waves into the body. Studies have shown the treatment to be promising for treating Achilles tendonitis.[14][16]', 'If Achilles tendonitis injuries take a long time to heal, a treatment where the person’s blood is taken from the arm vein and separated to extract platelet-rich plasma, which is then injected back into the tendon site, may be an option. However, while the evidence suggests few harmful side effects, there is still discussion around the treatment’s effectiveness.[13]', 'Good to know: Corticosteroid injections may help to reduce inflammation and pain on a short term basis, but are not generally recommended for Achilles tendonitis, because they make the tendon more likely to rupture, especially if multiple, recurrent injections are given.[7]', 'Surgical treatments for Achilles tendonitis', 'Where Achilles tendonitis fails to respond to non-surgical methods after six months, surgery may be necessary. There are a number of surgical procedures available, depending on the nature and location of the injury. A surgeon will recommend the best option. Possible procedures include:[4][17]', '\nDebridement and repair, which removes damaged parts of the tendon. This may be performed if less than 50 percent of the tendon is damaged\nDebridement with tendon transfer may be performed when more than 50 percent of the tendon is damaged. The remaining tendon is supported with other tendon tissue, often taken from the long tendon of the big toe\nGastrocnemius recession, which lengthens the calf muscle to place less stress on the Achilles tendon\nBone spur removal, in cases of insertional tendonitis. Artificial anchors may be implanted to attach the tendon to the bone\n']"

A severe form of acne that may cause scarring.\n']","['Pimples occur when dead skin cells and oil clog the pores of the skin. As more oil builds up behind the blockage, the pore becomes inflamed, and the pimple becomes painful and swollen. Acne typically appears for the first time during adolescence, triggered by a group of hormones known as androgens which begin to circulate in the body during puberty.', 'Acne will often improve in early adulthood, but can persist longer. The condition affects teenage boys more often than girls, but, in adults, women develop it more commonly than men. There are a number of triggers that can make the development of acne more likely, including:[1]', '\nThe use of the progesterone-only contraceptive pill\nThe hormonal changes triggered by menstrual periods\nSome types of makeup\nPicking or squeezing existing pimples\nSweating heavily\nHumid weather\nTight clothing, headbands or collars, for example\nSome medicines.

Not all preventive measures will work for all people, however, and no technique is guaranteed to be effective.', 'Techniques for helping to prevent acne include:[4][5]', '\nKeeping the face clean: The face should be cleaned roughly twice daily using warm water and a mild soap in order to remove impurities and dead skin cells form the surface. Avoid washing the face too often, however, and do not use a harsh soap or cleanser.\nMoisturize: Moisturizing can help to keep the skin moist and prevent it from peeling. Products with “non-comedogenic” on the label should not block the pores and thus also not contribute to acne.\nDiet and exercise: Eating a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, and low in fats and sugars may help to control acne. Similarly, getting plenty of exercise may also help to prevent acne outbreaks, as well as promoting general good health. After exercising, be sure to wash away any residual sweat, as this can contribute to acne.\nAvoid makeup: Limiting makeup use may help to prevent an acne outbreak. Any makeup that is used should be oil-free and non-comedogenic.\nShampoo often: Wash the hair regularly with shampoo. If the hair is particularly oily, use shampoo daily.\nDon’t touch: Avoid the temptation to touch the face throughout the day and be sure not to squeeze, pick or pop pimples; this will allow the acne to heal naturally.\nAvoid excessive sunlight and tanning beds: Too much exposure to the sun and the use of tanning beds may damage the skin and is therefore not recommended.\nOver-the-counter medication: Many anti-acne products are available over the counter from pharmacists and general stores. As well as controlling outbreaks after they have occurred, these products may help to prevent an outbreak from happening in the first place.\n']"

If this does not happen and the appendix bursts, potentially life threatening infections can result. If bacteria from a burst appendix reaches the peritoneum (the inner lining of the belly), this can result in an infection known as peritonitis. Signs of peritonitis include severe continuous abdominal pain, abdominal swelling, vomiting and fever. Another possible consequence of a burst appendix is the formation of an abscess.

According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), approximately 40 million adults in the U.S. between the ages of 18 and 51 are diagnosed as being affected by anxiety disorders. However, the total number of people who are affected by anxiety disorders – and who are therefore predisposed to experience a panic attack – is thought to be far greater.[7]', 'Panic is the most acute form of anxiety. As such, a panic attack is caused by heightened anxiety, whereby the body undergoes physiological changes due to one’s thoughts, entering into a state called fight or flight mode. A person may not be consciously aware of the thoughts that induce this state, as it can be caused by the brain’s background activity.', 'Fight or flight mode is an automatic response to danger, rapidly preparing the body for physical activity, such as running away from or fighting off a predator. In a panic attack, however, there is usually no immediate physical threat to escape from.[8]', 'Physiological changes associated with fight or flight mode, that may contribute to a panic attack, include:', '\nIncreased metabolic rate\nIncreased heart rate\nRelease of metabolic energy resources such as glycogen\nInhibited action of the digestive system\nConstriction of blood vessels\nLoss of hearing and dilation of pupils\nRelaxation of the bladder and sphincters\n', 'Triggers', 'Stress is a principal factor in experiencing a panic attack. A panic attack may relate to life events that are stressful for a given individual in the short term, such as giving a presentation or boarding an airplane. However, continuous stressors, such as having a job one dislikes or an emotionally unhealthy relationship, can also increase one’s predisposition to anxiety and can therefore be triggers for panic attacks.[9] In research, stress related to illness and interpersonal conflict has been cited as the most common known triggers of panic attacks by affected people.', 'It is also common to be unable to pinpoint the trigger(s) of one’s panic attack. People, who experience panic attacks, often describe their mental state as being calm prior to the unexpected attack, and panic attacks can also affect people who do not consider themselves to be under stress. This may be because the anxious thoughts which generate the panic attack are subconscious rather than conscious.', 'Panic attacks can occur in any situation or location. Panic attacks in public spaces ‒ such as shopping centers and public transportation ‒ are particularly common.[10]', 'In people with panic disorder, situations or locations, in which one has already experienced a panic attack, can often become triggers for future panic attacks, as they can develop negative associations due to the fear of experiencing a panic attack again.', 'Situations, in which panic attacks commonly occur include:[11]', '\nBeing in a crowded place\nDriving\nBeing on public transport\nBoarding or being inside a plane\n', 'People with panic disorder often experience a reduced quality of life, because they make lifestyle changes that are designed to avoid trigger situations, such as avoiding crowded places.']","['If one’s doctor diagnoses a mental health condition, such as panic disorder or another form of anxiety disorder, as a result of one’s consultation about panic attack(s), then an appropriate treatment plan will be devised. This will usually involve psychotherapy and/or medication, tailored to the needs of the individual and to managing their diagnosed condition(s).', 'This section provides advice on how to manage a panic attack during the episode itself and on the prevention of future panic attacks.', 'Dealing with a panic attack', 'Although a panic attack comes on suddenly, often with no prior indication that it is going to happen, its initial symptoms intensify, and it tends to reach its peak after around 10 minutes. One can begin deploying various coping strategies to reduce the severity of a panic attack as soon as one notices the first signs.', 'Techniques which are useful in navigating a panic attack focus on calming the mind and body. Used effectively, they can reduce the severity of a given panic attack or prevent its initial stages developing into a full-symptom panic attack. Many helpful techniques related to managing a panic attack or preventing future episodes are derived from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which focuses on making changes to a person’s usual thought processes and behavior in relation to particular concepts.', 'Strategies for managing an oncoming panic attack include:[15]', 'Relaxing the muscles', 'A panic attack causes one’s muscles to tense up, so performing muscle relaxing exercises,  focused on relaxing both specific muscle groups and one’s entire body, can help calm the body during a panic attack.', 'Stopping all activities', 'It is important to give oneself the space and time to experience and recover from a panic attack. If at work or at a social occasion, walk away and, if possible, find a quiet area in which to experience the panic attack and employ coping strategies such as breathing techniques. Interruptions from others, however well-intentioned, can make it difficult to focus on restoring the body and mind to a calmer state.', 'Thinking positively', ""There are many CBT techniques designed to help with deconstructing anxious thoughts and restoring calm during and after a panic attack. Doctors or psychotherapists will be able to recommend techniques appropriate to each person's mental health status and the nature of their panic attack(s)."", 'Breathing exercises', ""The sensation of shortness of breath is one of the most commonly experienced symptoms of a panic attack. This is primarily due to the fact that panic causes breathing to become irregular. Re-regulating one's breathing is one of the most important methods for restoring the body to its pre-panic state."", 'Breathing techniques for panic attacks focus on encouraging a person to breathe deeply and to breathe from the stomach rather than the chest. Many people begin to breathe in a shallow manner during a panic attack. This can inspire the sensation of shortness of breath, which can intensify the panic attack. It is important to remember that the sensation of shortness of breath is not actually dangerous, although it may contribute to one’s perception that one is dying during the panic attack episode.', 'Many people find it helpful to breathe into a paper bag during a panic attack. Inhaling recycled air is believed to raise the carbon dioxide levels in the blood, which can help to end a panic attack.[16]']"
['Acute Pharyngitis'],"['Pharyngitis, or acute pharyngitis, is an inflammation of the back of the throat, otherwise known as the pharynx. The condition generally causes pain and a sensation of scratchiness in the region of the throat, as well as difficulty swallowing.[1] The condition is typically referred to as a sore throat.', 'Pharyngitis is a very common complaint, usually caused by a viral infection, or, more rarely, a bacterial infection. In the majority of cases, it will disappear within a week, though can last longer. Treatment will usually focus on managing the symptoms. However, antibiotics may be prescribed to treat the bacterial form of the condition . Generally, it is a non-serious condition, though in some instances it can cause severe symptoms or a serious infection.', 'Chronic pharyngitis', 'Pharyngitis is usually a temporary condition, lasting for roughly one week. In a small number of cases, however, a sore throat can be recurring, becoming a condition known as chronic pharyngitis. The chronic form of the condition has a variety of possible causes, including persistent infection and stomach acid reflux. If pharyngitis lasts for weeks, it is probably chronic rather than acute pharyngitis. Smoking, vaping and exposure to other forms of smoke, such as industrial or woodsmoke, can all cause a chronic sore throat.']","['A variety of symptoms are associated with pharyngitis, with some of the most common including:[2]', '\nSore throat\nPain or difficulty when swallowing or talking\nSwollen, sore glands in the neck or throat\nRed throat and red, swollen tonsils\nA hoarse voice\nWhite or grey patches on the back of the throat\n', 'A sore throat is the characteristic symptom of pharyngitis and – in some cases – may be the only symptom. A cobblestone appearance at the back of the throat, colloquially known as “cobblestone throat,” is in some cases present. This is a distinctive lumpy, irritated appearance of the back of the throat, caused by enlarged lymphatic tissue. It is visible on visual inspection. It can also be caused by a post-nasal drip, in which mucus that accumulates in the back of the nose and throat drips downward from the back of the nose.', 'Commonly, pharyngitis is caused by an underlying condition such as a common cold or flu. If this is the case, it may be accompanied by symptoms of these conditions, such as fever, coughing or a runny nose. If you think that you or a loved one may have a cold, flu or pharyngitis, you can start a free symptom assessment with Ada now.']","['Pharyngitis is usually caused by the viruses that also cause a common cold or flu. In rare cases, the condition can be caused by bacteria. It is difficult to determine whether a case of pharyngitis has a viral or bacterial cause, since the symptoms are similar.[3] Smoking, vaping and exposure to airborne irritants can also cause a sore throat.', 'Viral infection', 'Viral conditions that can lead to pharyngitis include:', '\nFlu\nCommon cold (adenovirus infection)\nMeasles\nChickenpox\nMononucleosis (mono, caused by the Epstein-Barr virus)\nCroup (a childhood illness)\nHerpes simplex infection\nEnterovirus infection\n', 'The viruses that cause the condition are contagious, normally spread by discharge from the nose or mouth.

Antibiotics are not helpful in cases of pharyngitis caused by viral infections, and are only used in cases where a bacterial infection is lingering. Most treatment for pharyngitis can be carried out at home, using over-the-counter products.', 'Home remedies for pharyngitis', 'There are a number of ways to help manage the symptoms of the condition:[11]', '\nDrinking plenty of fluids is key to avoiding dehydration, which can make the symptoms of pharyngitis worse.\nTaking over the counter painkillers, such as ibuprofen or paracetamol, is a good way of managing pain, headaches and fever.

They will look for:[11]', '\nPus on the tonsils\nPainful or tender glands on the neck\nThe absence of a cough\nFever\n', 'If three or more of these features are present, a doctor will often prescribe a delayed prescription, whereby antibiotics will be prescribed for two or three days in the future, to be used if symptoms have not disappeared or have gotten worse.']"
['Acute Pyelonephritis'],"['Acute pyelonephritis is a bacterial infection of the kidneys. While most episodes clear without causing lasting renal damage, it can be severe and is usually quite painful, although few patients will need to be hospitalised.[1]', 'This condition is most common among young adult women, but can affect anyone of any age.[2] Men are at relatively low risk of acute pyelonephritis, unless they are older than 65 years of age.[3]', 'Causes and risk factors', 'Most cases of acute pyelonephritis occur when bacteria, that are present in the gastrointestinal tract, come into contact with the urethra, move into the bladder and travel upward from the bladder to the kidneys.[1] In rare cases, the condition can arise hematogenously, which means that the bacteria which cause it originate and travel in the blood.', 'Some of the bacteria most commonly implicated in such infections are:[2][3]', '\nEscherichia coli,more commonly referred to as e. coli\nPseudomonas aeruginosa\nStaphylococcus saprophyticus\nGroup B streptococci\nEnterococci\nOther enterobacteriaceae\nKlebsiella spp.\nCorynbacterium urealyticum\nMycobacteria\n', 'In rare cases, yeasts and fungi may also be implicated. However, e. coli is by far the most common bacteria causing acute pyelonephritis. Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), the backward flow of urine from the bladder to the kidneys, may also lead to acute pyelonephritis, as the refluxing urine can possibly carry bacteria.[3]', 'Although pyelonephritis can occur among any group of people, young women are most at risk, particularly between the ages of 15 and 29. This may have to do with the role of frequent sexual intercourse in introducing bacteria to the exterior opening of the urethra and from there to the bladder. The use of spermicidal contraceptives can increase the risk of pyelonephritis, as well as cystitis and other urinary tract infections, because they destroy the natural protective barrier of bacteria that should be in the vaginal area and allow enteric bacteria to colonise the area instead.[2]  New sexual partners can also increase one’s risk of a urinary tract infection (UTI), with more frequent sexual intercourse increasing the risk of potentially introducing new bacteria. There is some medical evidence that women with diabetes may be at slightly higher risk of contracting UTIs and consequently acute pyelonephritis.[4]', 'Urinary tract infections (UTIs) also increase an individual’s susceptibility to acute pyelonephritis. Many of the bacteria associated with pyelonephritis are the same as those which can cause cystitis. In addition, women whose mothers have a history of UTIs may be more vulnerable to acute pyelonephritis.', 'Other factors that increase an individual’s risk of developing acute pyelonephritis include:[2][3]', '\nDiabetes mellitus\nStress urinary incontinence\nA structurally or functionally abnormal genitourinary tract, such as might result from infected cysts, underdeveloped kidneys, spinal cord injuries, or VUR.\nCatheterisation\nStents or drainage procedures in or around the kidneys\nPregnancy\nBiliary cirrhosis, a chronic condition where bile ducts in the liver are damaged\nProstate enlargement\nImmunocompromised states, such as might occur during chemotherapy.\n', 'If you are concerned that you or someone you may have acute pyelonephritis, you can do a free symptom assessment with the Ada app at any time.', 'Symptoms', 'The most distinctive features of acute pyelonephritis are pain in the back, flank or belly, fever at or above 38 C / 100.4 F, chills, nausea and vomiting.

The latter is an enzyme produced by white blood cells.\nUrinalysis (analysis of the urine) to check for white blood cell casts and microscopic pyuria, i.e. pus in the urine.\nA bacterial culture of the urine to determine what kind of bacteria has caused the pyelonephritis. This may be particularly useful if the first line of antibiotic treatments does not clear up the infection, suggesting that the bacteria is drug-resistant or that another pathogen is responsible.\nBlood tests, such as a complete blood count should be performed in more complicated cases, along with analysis of inflammation markers. Markers that can indicate declining kidney function, and measurement of electrolytes may be necessary, too.\nImaging tests such as an MRI, CT scan or ultrasound.\n', 'Doctors will also take a history from the patient to determine whether any underlying disorders, such as a genitourinary abnormality or diabetes mellitus, are present and gather information about their lifestyle, for example, whether or not the patient is sexually active, experiences stress urinary incontinence, etc to find out what may have caused the infection to set in.', 'Treatment', 'Most people affected by  acute pyelonephritis are successfully treated with  antibiotics and do not need to be hospitalised. However, in cases of very severe and/or complicated infections, hospitalisation may be safest in order to monitor the infection consistently and to control its spread most effectively.

If these signs appear, seek emergency medical help immediately.', 'Learn more about Sepsis >>', 'FAQs', 'Q: Can I prevent acute pyelonephritis? \nA: Acute pyelonephritis cannot be entirely prevented, but the risk can be minimised. Remaining adequately hydrated flushes potentially harmful microorganisms and urine out of the bladder and urethra, reducing the risk of infection.', 'Avoiding spermicides and vaginal douches, as well as urinating after sex (for both men and women) also removes potentially dangerous bacteria from the area of the urethra and urethral opening. Urinating when the urge arises, rather than waiting to do so, and fully emptying the bladder lower the risk of kidney infections.[12]', 'In cases where infection arises, the period of recovery can be shortened by promptly seeking medical attention.', 'Q: Frequent sexual intercourse is listed as a cause of UTIs and a risk factor for acute pyelonephritis, but what is “frequent sexual intercourse?” and why is it so important? \nA:  What constitutes frequent sexual intercourse varies according to various factors, such as marital status and age. For example, married/partnered young women tend to have sex more often than single young women.[13]', 'Some studies have found that sex three or more times a week, or ten times in the last month, increases the risk of getting a UTI.[14] It does seem to be the case that frequent sex is the major risk factor for getting a UTI. About 80% of women with a UTI have had sex within the last day.[15]', 'The cause of this high risk appears to be that, during sex, new bacteria, usually from the enteric tract and anal area, are introduced to the vaginal and urethral area. New partners carry new combinations of bacteria and have different effects on skin pH, among other things. However, smoking and having previously had a UTI also increase risk. Anatomical differences between women, like the size of the pelvis and vaginal pH, may also affect risk.', 'Q: Does cystitis or urinary tract infection increase my risk of acute pyelonephritis? \nA: Cystitis is a very common urinary tract infection, specifically an inflammatory infection of the bladder. Many of the bacteria that cause acute pyelonephritis can cause cystitis. Many of the symptoms are similar to those of acute pyelonephritis.[16]', 'Both men and women can get cystitis. Recurrent, severe and/or untreated cystitis can increase the risk of acute pyelonephritis.', 'Q: I am male; how serious is my risk of acute pyelonephritis? \nA: Men are generally at lower risk than women; however, older men and male infants have the same level of risk as older women and female infants. Male infants with genitourinary abnormalities are at higher risk than female infants. However, due to the fact that the urethral opening and anus are further apart in men than in women, there is less likelihood of bacteria being transferred from one to the other. The risk is only lower, not absent.[16]', 'Men are advised to use condoms to reduce the risk of coming into contact with enteric bacteria that may enter the urethra, whether their partner is male or female. It may be advisable to avoid sexual activity while either partner has a UTI or kidney infection.', '', '\n\nBMJ Best Practice. “Acute pyelonephritis”. November 2017.

['Alcohol Intoxication'],"['Alcohol intoxication, or drunkenness, is a temporary condition caused by drinking alcohol. Severe alcohol intoxication is also known as alcohol poisoning.', 'Although alcohol intoxication most commonly results from Ethanol contained in commercial alcoholic beverages, there are several other types of alcohol, found in a variety of sources, that can cause it. These include:[1]', '\nMethanol, which smells similar to ethanol, but is used in industrial applications\nIsopropanol, also known as isopropyl alcohol, which is used in disinfectants and antiseptics\nEthylene glycol, which is used in antifreeze\n', 'Good to know: Methanol is extremely toxic. If consumed, ten milliliters of methanol can cause blindness, and consuming thirty milliliters is potentially fatal.[1]', 'In adults, alcohol intoxication usually results from consuming alcoholic beverages. However, adults and children alike may also, accidentally or deliberately, consume the following household substances that contain alcohol:[2]', '\nColognes and perfumes\nMouthwash\nAftershave\nSolvents\nChafing-dish and portable camp-stove fuels\nMedications, such as cough syrup\n', 'Alcohol consumed orally is absorbed into the blood via the small intestine and the stomach, and because the body can absorb alcohol faster than it can metabolise or eliminate it, blood alcohol concentrations (BAC) peak between half an hour and ninety minutes after consumption.[3]', 'Alcohol is consumed primarily because some effects of mild alcohol intoxication, such as an increased sense of well-being and increased social confidence, are considered pleasant. However, negative effects, such as a fast heartbeat and nausea, can be felt as a result of having even low blood alcohol levels.', 'With increasing levels of blood alcohol, symptoms like dizziness, nausea, vomiting, changes in speech or a loss of control over body movements can occur. Acute alcohol intoxication is the most common alcohol-related disorder for which people are admitted to hospital.[2]', 'In severe cases, alcohol intoxication may lead to conditions that can temporarily impair the pancreas or liver. This impairment may become chronic if it recurs. However, alcohol intoxication is usually treated with fluids, and many people experience no lasting health consequences from alcohol intoxication itself, particularly if it is an isolated incident rather than a regular occurence. People who have mild to moderate alcohol intoxication usually recover well, although they may suffer symptoms including headache, nausea and vomiting for 1 or 2 days. This is known as a hangover. Heavy alcohol intoxication might result in serious health effects and may lead to complications and even death.', 'Risks of alcohol intoxication', 'Alcohol intoxication is caused by an excessive intake of alcohol; it is a very common condition.', 'Alcohol is a central nervous system depressant.[3] The absorption rate of alcohol and associated risk of alcohol intoxication depends not only on the quantity of alcohol, but also on the context in which it was drunk.

The medications most commonly prescribed to help alleviate the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal are called benzodiazepines. These can help prevent minor alcohol withdrawal symptoms from becoming worse, e.g. in people for whom delirium tremens is considered to be a risk. Medications are not usually part of a typical first-line treatment plan for alcohol withdrawal, and these medications will be administered at the discretion of the medical professionals who monitor the detox process.', 'The second step in treating alcohol withdrawal involves psychological evaluation to identify the underlying causes of a person’s alcohol dependency. These causes may be psychological, physical, biochemical and/or social. Doctors will work with the affected person to identify these causes and to devise a long-term treatment plan tailored to their needs in order to help them remain abstinent from alcohol on a long-term basis.', 'Long-term treatment', 'After the detox, people with a severe alcohol dependence will require the assistance of a qualified treatment centre, a rehabilitation centre, to help them recover from alcohol dependency. This period, which can last weeks or months, can be experienced as an inpatient or an outpatient, depending on the needs of the affected person. Most people with mild to moderate alcohol withdrawal symptoms will find treatment as an outpatient sufficient.[7]', 'To help people recover in the long-term, treatment centres will also provide advice on how to overcome alcohol dependency and on self-care and establishing living habits that promote their overall health and happiness. A person recovering from alcohol dependency may also be advised to attend support groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous to help them remain abstinent from alcohol.']"

The cells of the body release chemical substances which cause swelling in different areas.', 'This sets off a series of events which cause the body to lose control of its vital functions, the respiratory and/or cardiovascular system. The blood vessels widen, which leads to a drop in blood pressure. The tissues in the airways swell, which causes difficulty breathing and may completely block the airways. If air cannot be taken into the lungs, the blood cannot be oxygenated. Oxygenated blood is needed so that the cells of organs, such as the brain, can work.

['Appendix Pain'],"['Appendix pain is typically described as pain or discomfort in the abdominal area (the belly), in the lower right side, where the appendix is located. Medically speaking, there is no such thing as “appendix pain”, even though the affected person may describe or experience it as such.

The exact biological function of the appendix is unknown. Abdominal pain in the region of the appendix may be caused by acute appendicitis, an inflammation of the appendix that should be treated as a medical emergency. The characteristic pain that results from acute appendicitis will typically begin in the vicinity of the stomach or belly button and then, as the abdominal wall and other organs begin to be affected by inflammation, the pain will move towards the lower right side of the abdomen and become more severe. However, pain from inflammation originating in the appendix, may also be felt elsewhere in the abdominal area, though it is very common for it to be felt in the lower right region.', 'Other symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and fever may also occur.[1]', 'Pain in the region of the abdomen is easily confused with pain from acute appendicitis, which specifically affects the appendix. A wide-range of conditions can cause such abdominal pain, including non-serious buildups of gas or indigestion, as well as more serious conditions, such as ulcers, infection of the ovaries, diverticulitis, inflammatory bowel diseases or kidney infection.

In most people, the appendix is located in the lower right-hand side of the abdomen. Although the exact function of the appendix is unknown – and for a time it was widely believed to have no function – some doctors believe that the appendix may serve as a storage unit for good bacteria and play a role in the development of the immune system.[4]', 'Causes of abdominal pain in the region of the appendix', 'As pain specific to acute appendicitis and abdominal pain from other causes are easily confused, it’s important to be aware of all of the common conditions that can cause this pain.', 'Appendix pain location - which regions of the abdomen can be affected?', 'Appendix pain is located in the abdomen.', 'The abdomen can be divided into four quadrants, by imagining a vertical line running through the navel (belly button) and another running line through it horizontally.[5] The human abdomen is a large region of the human body, and it is the location of a number of organs and organ systems.[6]', 'The left upper quadrant contains the stomach, spleen, left kidney, small intestine, descending colon and transverse colon.[7]', 'The left lower quadrant contains the small intestine and the descending colon, sigmoid colon and rectum.[6]', 'The lower right quadrant contains the small intestine, the cecum and the appendix, as well as the ascending colon.', 'The upper right quadrant contains the pancreas, gallbladder, liver, right kidney, small intestine, ascending colon and transverse colon.', 'The bladder lies roughly on the midline of the lower quadrants. The abdominal cavity is lined by the peritoneum, which is made up of connective tissue.[6] The peritoneum can become infected, a condition known as peritonitis (see below). The organs are held in a web of tissue known as the mesentery.', 'In men, the abdomen also contains the prostate, which is situated just below the bladder. In women, the abdomen also contains the uterus, cervix, ovaries and fallopian tubes. These differences between men and women mean that, in some cases, pain may be felt differently. This is partly because different organs and structures are involved. In acute appendicitis, men and women experience pain in the same regions.', 'Different disorders within the abdominal region may cause pain in different regions. For example, gastritis is usually felt in the left upper abdominal quadrant, while pain from an inflamed gallbladder or gallstones is felt in the right upper region.

In this test, the doctor slowly presses their fingers on a part of the abdomen that does not hurt - in the case of suspected acute appendicitis, this would be the left-hand side - and then quickly lets go. The affected person feels pain in the lower right abdominal area. This sort of pain is known as “contralateral rebound tenderness”, as pain occurs on the side opposite to where the pressure is applied.', 'In very few cases, the reason for appendix pain being felt on the left may be because of a hereditary condition known as situs inversus, in which the organs of the chest and abdomen are in mirror-image positions – that is, they are on the opposite side to where they are in most people.[24] In people with situs inversus, for example, the liver and appendix are on the left of the abdomen. However, situs inversus only affects about one in 8000 people, and it is far more likely that, if you feel appendix pain on the left, it is because of rebound tenderness.[25]', '', '\n\nPatient. “Appendicitis.” August 1, 2017.

['Arthritis'],"['Arthritis is a very common condition characterized by inflammation of one or more joints.', 'The key symptoms of arthritis include pain, stiffness and swelling. Arthritis can be localized to one joint or it can affect many joints, and can affect different structures inside a joint, such as the synovium (joint lining), bones, cartilage, or supporting tissues. The symptoms can also vary in severity and frequency. Some forms of arthritis are short term conditions, while others are long-term, and may permanently damage joint function.', 'According to the Centers for Disease Control, about one in four adults in the U.S. have arthritis (54 million).[1] Many forms of arthritis tend to predominantly affect older people, though it can affect people at any age and there are some conditions, generally rare, that cause arthritis in children and teenagers.', 'There are many possible causes of arthritis, such as age-related wear and tear, autoimmune conditions, infections, injuries and others. Each type of arthritis tends to be characterized by which joints are affected and the usual age at which people are affected.', 'A range of treatment options are available for arthritis, with the chosen option dependent on the type of arthritis and its causes. Some types of arthritis respond well to treatment, while other types are more hard to control.', 'Different types of arthritis and symptoms, causes and treatment', 'There are many different types of arthritis – some sources estimate over 200 – with differing causes and symptoms.[2]', 'Most, though not all, types of arthritis can be sorted by cause into two overarching categories:', 'Inflammatory arthritis: All arthritis is characterized by inflammation, which is part of the body’s healing process. However, in the case of inflammatory arthritis, inflammation generally occurs for no obvious reason. This is known as an autoimmune condition. The most common form of inflammatory arthritis is rheumatoid arthritis. Types of inflammatory arthritis generally causes stiffness in the joints following rest, such as just after getting out of bed in the morning.', ""Degenerative or mechanical arthritis covers types of arthritis in which there is damage to the joints through wear and tear. The most common form of degenerative arthritis is osteoarthritis. Types of degenerative arthritis tend to worsen with movement and weight bearing and be relieved by rest. They also tend to be more common in older people. Types of degenerative arthritis tend to affect joints asymmetrically, meaning they don't appear in the same joints on both sides of the body."", 'Doctors categorize arthritis by whether the symptoms are symmetric (same joints on both sides of the body) or asymmetric, and by the number of joints affected.', 'The most common types of arthritis include:', 'Osteoarthritis', 'Osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis, with more than 30 million adults in the U.S affected by the condition.[3] It is a degenerative arthritis, most often occurring in the hands, hips and knees.', 'The main symptoms of osteoarthritis are deep, achy joint pain that worsens with activity, decreased range of movement and stiffness during rest, known as gelling. It generally affects several joints. It is most common in women leading up to and after menopause.[4] Athletes are also at increased risk of osteoarthritis, due to repeated use of particular joints.', 'The condition is caused by damage to or breakdown of joint cartilage, a connective tissue that covers the ends of long bones at the joints, as well as other areas of the joint organ.[5] In normal joints, cartilage acts as a shock absorber and allows bones to slide over one another. Osteoarthritis damage may occur as a result of joint injury or overuse.', 'Treatment includes regular exercise, hot or cold compresses, working towards a healthy weight if overweight, physical and occupational therapy, and pain medication. In severe cases, surgery may repair, strengthen or replace a damaged joint.', 'Rheumatoid arthritis', 'Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the second most common type of arthritis and the most common type of inflammatory arthritis.', 'Symptoms of RA occur in flare-ups, when symptoms of pain and swelling are worse, and periods of improved or no symptoms. It usually affects the hands, feet and wrists. Usually the joints are affected symmetrically, and many joints may be inflamed. Rheumatoid arthritis can also cause inflammation in other  parts of the body, such as the lungs, heart and eyes. Other common symptoms include symptoms such as fever, fatigue and weight loss.', 'Rheumatoid arthritis is especially common in women and in smokers.[4] The age of onset for rheumatoid arthritis is usually after 35 years old, however, it becomes more common with age, and most people are diagnosed in their 60s.[6] The condition can, however occur at any age and normally worsens with time.', 'Over time, the ongoing inflammation can cause damage to the bones of the joint, which in turn causes changes to the shape and alignment of the joint. This may lead to an inability to do activities which use the affected joints. However, rheumatoid arthritis inflammation can normally be well managed with medications to slow down the immune system, called disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDS), as well as pain medications for relief of symptoms. Surgery is sometimes carried out in cases where a joint becomes badly damaged. There is currently no specific cure for rheumatoid arthritis.', 'Gout', 'Gout is an inflammatory arthritis causing attacks of pain and inflammation in one or more joints. It is a very common condition, which is more common in men and increasingly common with age.', 'Gout is caused by a chemical called uric acid in the blood. It is usually caused by having persistently high levels of uric acid in the blood. A sudden decrease in the uric acid level, as can be caused by uric acid-lowering medications, can sometimes also trigger an attack of symptoms.', 'This is often caused either by excess amounts of uric acid being produced, or not enough being excreted from the urine on a chronic basis. Any abrupt increase in the level of uric acid in the blood may also trigger an attack of podagra orand gout. Uric acid can crystallize and settle in one or more joints, which may initiate an immune response, causing the characteristic inflammation of gout.', 'Most people with elevated blood levels of uric acid will never develop podagra and gout, and gout is not always associated with elevated uric acid blood levels; the condition can also occur despite there being normal levels of uric acid at the point in time when blood levels are measured.[4]', 'Uric acid is a chemical increased in the body by eating some foods, especially oily fish, red meat, organ meats such as liver or kidneys, drinking alcohol, conditions such as high blood pressure or obesity, as well as taking certain medications.', 'Gout tends to start with severe pain in one joint, often that of the big toe, where it is known as podagra, before later beginning to affect other joints. People with gout may experience fever and fatigue. In cases of chronic, untreated gout, usually after about ten years, a person may develop tophi, which are uric acid crystal deposits appearing as firm, yellowish nodules on the joint.[7]', 'Treatment often involves avoiding foods that cause gout and taking medications to relieve pain and inflammation and decrease the amount of uric acid in the body. Many people are able to manage and avoid episodes of gout using these measures.[8]', 'Psoriatic arthritis', 'Psoriatic arthritis is a long-term inflammatory arthritis that is associated with psoriasis, a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin with silvery scales, known as plaques. Some people also have symptoms in their fingernails or eyes. About one or two in every five people with psoriasis will develop psoriatic arthritis.[9] Some people with psoriatic arthritis, however, will never develop the skin condition.', 'Psoriatic arthritis is an autoimmune condition thought to be triggered by a combination of genetic, immune and environmental factors, such as certain infections and joint injury.[10]', 'The condition is progressive, damaging the joints over time. However, with medication it is possible to slow down the progression of the arthritis and minimize joint damage. The condition varies widely in severity and the number of joints affected. It tends to occur in flare-ups and periods of improved or no symptoms. There are different typical patterns of psoriatic arthritis, affecting certain groups of joints, most often the distal joints, the end joints of the fingers and toes. Most commonly, psoriatic arthritis is asymmetric, not affecting the same joints on both sides of the body, and causes symptoms in several joints at once.', 'Psoriatic arthritis is treated with medications which suppress the immune system, called disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDS), as well as over-the-counter medications, such as ibuprofen, to reduce pain and swelling. Ideally, one medication should be taken to treat both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis when both conditions are present together.', 'People with other types of arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis, may also have psoriasis without the two conditions being linked.', 'Septic arthritis', 'Septic arthritis is an infection in a joint, causing inflammation. It is usually caused by bacteria, though it may be caused by other microorganisms, such as a fungus.[11]', 'This condition can affect anyone, but most commonly occurs in association with prosthetic joints and other joint surgeries. It is caused by infectious agents reaching the joints, either directly, as in the case of surgery, or indirectly, reaching the joints via the bloodstream. Risk is increased in older people and those with diabetes or a suppressed immune system.', 'Symptoms involve severe pain, swelling, redness and heat in affected joints. They usually develop quickly, over a few hours or days. Many people with this condition also develop a fever. If the infection becomes widespread, affected people may also experience nausea, vomiting, dizziness or drowsiness.', 'Many people will need to stay in hospital for two weeks or more to have pus drained from the joint and intravenous antibiotics. Surgery may be needed to further drain pus or to replace an infected joint prosthesis. With antibiotic treatment and proper management, most people will recover well. Without treatment, septic arthritis may lead to permanent joint damage and can be life-threatening.', 'Reactive arthritis', 'Reactive arthritis (ReA), formerly known as Reiter’s syndrome, Reiter’s disease or Reiter’s arthritis, is a relatively short-lived inflammatory arthritis. Reactive arthritis develops as a reaction to certain bacterial infections, most often genital tract or bowel infections. Reactive arthritis is not an infection of the joints. It is more common in younger people than other forms of arthritis.', 'Reactive arthritis generally begins one to four weeks after a bacterial infection and can last for up to six months. Some people experience repeated bouts of symptoms, and a few may develop chronic, usually mild arthritis.', 'Symptoms can range in severity from mild to severe, often appearing suddenly, lasting for several months and stopping within about six months. Symptoms often include asymmetric, oligoarticular inflammation of between two and five joints, red eyes and painful urination.', 'Typically, reactive arthritis is triggered by chlamydia, but can also be triggered by other infections, such as food poisoning.', 'There is no treatment specifically for reactive arthritis, but the condition normally stops on its own. Treatment involves antibiotics to treat the triggering infection and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to treat joint symptoms of inflammation and pain. Physiotherapy may be advised to keep the affected joints moving, in order to help retain flexibility and strength until symptoms subside.', 'Ankylosing spondylitis and other spondyloarthropathies', 'Ankylosing spondylitis is a lifelong inflammatory arthritis involving back pain. The word ankylosing means joining together or fusing, and spondylitis means inflammation of the spine. The condition causes the affected spine joints to fuse together into one bone. Inflammation causes the bone-making cells to grow bone within the ligaments, which then may form bony bridges between the vertebrae of the spine. The cause of the condition is unknown, but there is normally a genetic component. Smoking is known to make the disease more severe. The condition mainly affects the lower back, but can spread up the spine and also affect other joints.', 'Symptoms usually include back pain and stiffness, inflammation in other joints, and extreme tiredness. Onset normally occurs gradually in early adulthood, between the ages of 20 and 30.[12] Severity of symptoms varies widely. It is associated with a serious but treatable eye condition called uveitis.', 'Treatment involves physiotherapy and exercise, painkillers such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and medication to suppress the immune system.', 'Secondary arthritis', 'Some conditions may commonly cause the symptoms of arthritis, although the condition does not predominantly affect the joints. These include:[13][14]', 'Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), also known as lupus, is a long-term autoimmune condition that may cause inflammation in almost every part of the body, commonly including joint pains, as well as skin rashes and tiredness.', 'Paget’s disease of bone is a condition in which the normal cycle of bone renewal is disrupted, which can weaken the bones and in some cases cause them to become deformed. Osteoarthritis is a common complication of Paget’s disease.', 'Viral arthritis is inflammation of a joint caused by a viral infection. Some viruses have a tendency to affect the joints, such as dengue fever and mumps. This type of arthritis is normally self-limiting and requires no specific intervention.', 'Juvenile idiopathic arthritis', 'Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), previously known as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis or juvenile chronic arthritis, is a chronic inflammatory arthritis, that occurs in children under 16 years old. It is the most common autoimmune joint condition in children.', 'It is not known exactly what causes the autoimmune condition, but it is associated with inherited factors and may be triggered by infection.[15]', 'Juvenile idiopathic arthritis tends to affect children younger than 10 but does not generally affect those younger than 6 months old. Girls are more commonly affected than boys and tend to manifest symptoms at a younger age.', 'There are different types of juvenile arthritis, with varying symptoms. All types of JIA involve pain, swelling and stiffness of one or more joints. Many children will also experience fever with this condition.', 'Treatment often involves taking medications that dampen the immune system. Many children with this condition live well with treatment, and find that their symptoms improve over time. Many children will grow out of JIA, though it is not possible to accurately predict this.', 'Diagnosing arthritis', 'In order to receive appropriate treatment, it is important to fully describe the nature of joint pain to the doctor, making sure to include information such as:', '\nHow long you have been experiencing joint inflammation and pain\nThe location and severity of the pain\nIf any family members have experienced arthritis or autoimmune conditions\nWhether there are other symptoms that occur besides the joint inflammation and pain\n', 'Following the investigation of a person’s medical history, a doctor will typically perform a physical exam to check for swollen joints or loss of motion, and use blood tests and X-rays to confirm a diagnosis and distinguish the type of arthritis.[16]', 'Treating arthritis', 'It is always important to seek prompt diagnosis and treatment of arthritis, as well as any other associated conditions, in order to prevent joint damage, which can lead to physical disability. Arthritis treatment will vary, depending on the type of arthritis, but generally may include:', '\nRest\nExercise\nMedication\nOccupational or physical therapy\nIn some cases, surgery\n', 'FAQs', 'Q: How many types of arthritis exist?\nA: Some sources estimate that there are over 200 different types of arthritis and related diseases. Arthritis can range from mild to severe. Causes are normally either degenerative “wear-and-tear” of cartilage, such as with osteoarthritis, or inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. Together all of these forms of arthritis make up the most chronic illness in the U.S. It is important to find out which type of arthritis is present, as each condition will have a different underlying cause, progression and treatment.', 'Q: Are there home remedies for arthritis?\nA: Yes, there are a number of home remedies for arthritis, which may help to relieve symptoms, but will not have a significant impact on the progress of the disease. Some of the most regularly cited include:', '\nUsing heat pads or ice packs\nSwimming\nOmega-3, which is found in fish, canola oil and supplements\n', 'However, if arthritis is suspected, professional medical attention should always be sought.', 'Q: What are some risk factors for arthritis?\nA: Although it depends on the type of arthritis, some factors increase the risks of several different types.

Overall, the medications aim to open the airways, improve airflow, and make breathing easier.']"
['Atherosclerosis'],"['Atherosclerosis is a condition in which fatty deposits, known as plaque or atheroma, build up within the walls of the arteries. Over time, these deposits of plaque may become larger, narrowing the arteries and restricting blood flow to certain organs.', 'Atherosclerosis is related to a number of cardiovascular conditions, including coronary heart disease and stroke. There are a variety of risk factors associated with the condition, with some of the most common including high cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking and obesity.', 'Although atherosclerosis is a potentially serious condition, it can be managed through lifestyle changes and treatment of its underlying causes.[1]', 'Atherosclerosis is a specific variety of arteriosclerosis, though the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Arteriosclerosis refers to a hardening and loss of elasticity in the arteries, which can lead to the same complications as those associated with atherosclerosis.[2]']",,"['Atherosclerosis is caused by a buildup of plaque in the artery walls. Plaque is composed of calcium, cholesterol, fats and other substances found in the blood. If it hardens, plaque can block the arteries and restrict blood flow.[3]', 'A number of pre-existing conditions, lifestyle choices and other factors can make atherosclerosis more likely. The most common of these include:[4]', '\nHigh cholesterol levels\nHigh blood pressure\nDiabetes\nSmoking\nObesity\nLack of physical activity\nUnhealthy diet (high in salt, sugar, fats and cholesterol)\nAgeing\nFamily history of cardiovascular disease\nStress\nAlcohol consumption\n', 'Conditions associated with atherosclerosis', 'Atherosclerosis may partially, or totally, block the arteries in the heart, brain, legs, arms, pelvis or kidneys. If this occurs, various conditions can result. These include:', 'Heart disease', 'A buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries, which supply oxygen-enriched blood to the heart, can lead to a significant narrowing of these arteries. If this happens, the blood flow to the heart is restricted – a condition which is called coronary artery disease or coronary heart disease. It is the most common condition associated with atherosclerosis.', 'Coronary heart disease can cause angina – feelings of pain, squeezing or tightening in the chest. Furthermore, if one of the plaques ruptures, or a clot of blood or fat gets stuck in the narrowed blood vessel, a heart attack may occur; this is a leading cause of mortality in the USA.[5][6][7]', 'Cerebrovascular conditions', 'Atherosclerosis can lead to a range of cerebrovascular conditions, including stroke and transient ischemic attack, sometimes called a mini-stroke. These conditions occur when plaque builds up in the arteries leading to the brain, restricting blood flow and starving the brain of oxygen.[8]', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Peripheral arterial disease generally refers to a narrowing of the arteries in any location other than the heart or brain, with the legs being the most commonly affected area. Atherosclerosis is one of the main causes of this condition. When affecting the legs, peripheral arterial disease is characterized by pain in the calves, especially when walking or exercising.[9]', 'Vascular dementia', 'Vascular dementia is a condition that results in memory loss, thinking problems and issues with language as a result of a reduced supply of blood to the brain. Along with Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia is one of the most common types of dementia.', 'Chronic kidney disease', 'Chronic kidney disease develops when the kidneys become unable to perform properly their function of filtering excess water and other waste products from the blood. A buildup of plaque in the arteries of the kidneys can cause chronic kidney disease, which can eventually lead to kidney failure.[10]', 'Erectile dysfunction', 'Atherosclerosis is among the leading causes of erectile dysfunction, the condition of being unable to get or maintain an erection. An erection is caused by a rush of blood to the penis. When the blood vessels in the penis begin to narrow, blood flow is restricted, causing erectile dysfunction.[11]', 'Diagnosing atherosclerosis', 'Diagnosing atherosclerosis will generally involve a doctor looking at an individual’s medical history, a physical examination and a range of tests.', 'During the physical examination, a stethoscope will normally be used to listen to the individual’s heartbeat and blood flow in the vessels. The medical professional will take special care to listen for sounds that indicate the narrowing of the blood vessels, which can often indicate the presence of plaque and clogged arteries.', 'Tests that may aid a diagnosis of atherosclerosis include:[12]', '\nBlood pressure measurement: A doctor will check whether the readings are out of range.\nBlood tests: To check the levels of fats, sugars, cholesterol and protein in the blood.\nElectrocardiogram (EKG): A method for testing the electrical activity of the heart.\nChest X-ray: An image of the organs and blood vessels within the chest is taken, allowing doctors to check for abnormalities.\nEchocardiography: An ultrasound is used to create an image of the heart. This can give doctors a holistic picture of the heart’s health.\nComputed tomography (CT) scan: A computer-generated image of the body is created, allowing doctors to see signs of artery narrowing or hardening.\nAngiography: A contrast dye is injected into specific blood vessels, which can then be visualized by X-ray. Catheters are often used. This test allows doctors to see signs of atherosclerosis.\n', 'Treating atherosclerosis', 'At present, no treatment exists to reverse atherosclerosis. However, there are a variety of ways to slow the progress of the condition and reduce the risk of complications, such as heart attack and stroke.[13] These include:[14]', '\nLifestyle changes that are also used to help prevent atherosclerosis (see below)\nStatins and other medications used to treat high cholesterol\nMedications used to treat high blood pressure\nLow-dose aspirin and other medications used to treat blood clots\nMedications for diabetes\nSurgical procedures to bypass or widen an artery, such as a coronary artery bypass graft or coronary angioplasty\n', 'A doctor will be able to advise on the treatment options available in each case.

['Atopic Dermatitis'],"['Atopic dermatitis, often called atopic eczema, is a common skin condition that typically causes dry, scaly, itchy, inflamed skin. The condition is particularly common in children under 5 years old, but may persist into later life. Atopic dermatitis is also known as infantile atopic dermatitis or baby eczema when it affects infants and young children.', 'Treatment typically involves keeping the skin moist and using creams or medications to soothe inflammation. Many children with atopic dermatitis will find that the condition improves over time, and that the symptoms of the condition disappear by adolescence. Some people, however, will experience atopic eczema into adulthood.']","['The symptoms of atopic dermatitis will usually appear before the age of 5. Typical symptoms of the condition include:[1]', '\nItchiness of the skin, which may intensify at nighttime\nPatches of red, inflamed skin\nSmall bumps on the skin\nSkin flaking\n', 'Atopic dermatitis is usually confined to one area of the body, though it can affect multiple areas in severe cases. Areas of skin which are near skin creases – such as the elbows, wrists, back of the knees and neck – are the most commonly affected areas. In infants, the face is the most commonly affected area.', 'Thickened skin or scars can develop from scratching or rubbing. If the affected area becomes infected, thick, yellow pus, as well as redness and crusting may appear.', 'The symptoms experienced, as well as the severity and duration of a flare-up, will differ from person to person.']","['The causes of atopic dermatitis are not yet fully understood. What is known is that the lipid (oily) barrier of skin is diminished in people with the condition and that substances, or cytokines, released by cells in the immune system may be a factor. The reason why these things affect some people and not others is unknown, however.[2]', 'There is a genetic element to atopic dermatitis. If both parents have the condition, a child stands roughly an 80 percent chance of inheriting it themselves; if only one parent has the condition, this figure drops to 60 percent.[2]', 'Risk factors', 'Atopic dermatitis is a common condition, especially in children younger than 5 years old. It is uncommon to experience a first episode in adulthood.', 'People with atopy – a predisposal to allergic conditions such as hay fever and allergic asthma, for example, tend to have a slightly higher chance of developing atopic dermatitis.

Keeping the skin moist helps to protect the skin from various irritants, which reduces the number of flare-ups experienced.', 'Depending on the severity of the condition, emollients may need to be applied between two and several times per day. They are most effective when applied directly after bathing – within three minutes – and should be applied liberally.[5] The most effective emollients are generally thick and contain little water, though a doctor, dermatologist or pharmacist will be able to advise on the best variety for each person.', 'Good to know: It is advisable to manage atopic dermatitis using products which have been specifically recommended for the use of people with the condition. Many commercial skincare products contain perfumes, and/or other chemicals which could irritate sensitive skin.', 'Steroid creams and ointments', 'Steroid creams and ointments, otherwise known as topical steroids, are used to reduce skin inflammation. They come in various strengths, from mild to very potent, with the stronger varieties being more effective at treating inflammation but with a greater risk of side-effects. Possible side-effects include a mild stinging when applied, and, more rarely, thinning of the skin, skin discoloration, acne and increased hair growth.[4]', 'For this reason, the long-term regular use of topical steroids is not recommended, and a course of this type of medication will typically need to be used for between 7 and 14 days. Commonly, a mild steroid will first be prescribed, followed by a stronger variety if the flare-up does not clear up within three to seven days. The cream or ointment will usually need to be applied liberally once or twice per day. In very severe cases, a short-course of steroid tablets may be prescribed to help manage symptoms when topical steroids have proven ineffective.', 'Other treatment methods', 'Additional treatment methods for atopic dermatitis include:[1][4]', '\nAntihistamine tablets; sometimes used to help manage the itching associated with atopic dermatitis. They can be very effective but tend to cause drowsiness in some people.\nUltraviolet light therapy; generally only recommended for people who have not responded to other treatment methods due to the expense as well as the possible risk of skin cancer.\nImmunosuppressive drugs; sometimes used in severe cases when no other treatment methods have proven effective.

This may mean that a child is easily distracted, struggles to take in and follow instructions, and is forgetful. The symptoms of inattention will typically not become apparent until a child is eight or nine years old.[3]\nCombined subtype: Children with this subtype will display features of both the hyperactive and inattention subtypes.\n', ""Hyperactivity in children with ADHD tends to fade after the age of eight or nine and may be difficult to detect to outside observers from then on.

The significance of this is not yet clear.\nGenetics: Research suggests that a child is more likely to develop ADHD if a close family member, such as a parent or sibling, also has the condition.\nLearning issues: While learning issues do not cause ADHD, children with conditions such as dyslexia, dyscalculia and dysgraphia are more likely to also experience ADHD.\nAntenatal problems: If a mother smokes, drinks alcohol or takes drugs during pregnancy, this may increase the likelihood of the child having ADHD.\nBirth problems: If a child is born with a low birth weight, is deprived of oxygen during birth or experiences any other kind of issue during birth, this may increase their chance of developing ADHD.\n', 'One or more of these factors may apply to a child with ADHD. Conversely, none of these factors may apply and there may be no clear cause of the condition.']","['The way in which a child with ADHD is treated will depend on the severity of the condition as well as the age of the child. Treatment should be coordinated by a team of professionals, including pediatricians, ADHD specialists and behavioral therapists.', 'The condition cannot be cured, but it can be effectively managed. The first stage of treatment will usually involve referral to a parent-training programme. The aim of this kind of training is to teach parents ways to manage behavioral problems, to understand the condition more thoroughly and to communicate more effectively with their child. These methods may also need to be taught to teachers and other caregivers, so activities can be tailored to suit the child’s attention span.[1]', 'Other treatments include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a method of psychological training that can help a child to understand why they act as they do and to come up with strategies to help manage their condition.', 'All children, including those with ADHD, are recommended to get at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity activity per day. Regular physical activity is associated with improved cardiovascular health, mental wellbeing and cognitive performance.', 'Medication can also be prescribed to help treat ADHD in children over the age of six. Methylphenidate is the most commonly prescribed medication. It works by increasing the amount of dopamine released into the parts of the brain responsible for attention and self-control. A child may need to take medication for a number of years.[1]', 'Medication is generally prescribed in severe cases of ADHD or in milder cases when other treatment options have not been effective.

There are some common signs, such as avoiding eye contact, finding social interactions difficult, being reliant on routines and getting upset at minor changes or certain smells, tastes, sounds or lights. Parents are often the first people to notice symptoms, but a diagnosis can only be made by a team of experienced specialists.', 'Q: Are autism rates going up?\nA: The number of people being diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder is increasing. However, it is unclear whether this is because there are more people with autism or whether parents, caregivers, schools and doctors are more aware of autism symptoms. This can lead to more people with autism being diagnosed, whereas, in the past, they might not have received a diagnosis.', 'Q: Are autism and ADHD related?\nA: Autism and ADHD share some symptoms. Some people with autism are misdiagnosed with ADHD before receiving the correct diagnosis. Autism and ADHD are different conditions, though people with both can display fidgety behavior, struggle with social skills, react unusually to sensory input and experience outbursts due to frustration. See the section on ADHD and autism.', 'Q: Are autism and Asperger syndrome the same?\nA: Asperger syndrome is a condition that is classified as an autism spectrum disorder. Autism is a spectrum disorder, meaning that people can have autism but show different symptoms of differing severity. People with Asperger syndrome are generally towards the higher functioning end of the autism spectrum. See the section on Asperger syndrome.', 'Q: Can autism be cured?\nA: There is no cure for autism. It is a lifelong condition. However, with appropriate intervention a person with autism spectrum disorder can learn to manage their behaviors and emotions, and have a better quality of day-to-day life. See the section on treatment.', 'Q: What diet should someone with autism and gastrointestinal problems have?\nA: It is common for people with autism to experience gastrointestinal problems. Discomfort can cause distress and difficult behavior, prompted by the underlying gastrointestinal medical condition. A doctor should be consulted to find the underlying cause. (See the section on Gastrointestinal problems.) No particular diet has been shown to affect symptoms of autism itself.', 'Other names for autism', 'Autism spectrum disorder\nASD', '', ""\n\nNational Institute of Child Health and Human Development. “About Autism.” January 2017.

The remaining 15 percent of people have secondary autism spectrum disorder, where a specific cause can be identified.[32]', 'Genetic causes of autism', 'In up to 25 percent of people with autism spectrum disorder the condition is thought to have a genetic cause. Over 100 genes, many of which concern brain development, may be involved in causing autism.[33][34][35]', 'Good to know: Not everyone with the identified genetic mutations has autism, and not everyone with autism has genetic mutations.', 'Autism can run in families, although it is unclear why. The brother of a child with autism has a 7 percent chance of developing autism, with an additional 7 percent chance of developing less severe autism spectrum symptoms. The sister of a child with autism has a 1 to 2 percent chance of developing autism plus the additional chance of less severe autism spectrum symptoms.[32][33]', 'Other genetic disorders, such as ADNP syndrome, can cause autism.[36]', 'Medications taken during pregnancy', 'Valproic acid is used to treat seizures, mania in people with bipolar disorder, and to prevent migraine headaches. Taking valproic acid during pregnancy increases the risk that the child will be born with serious birth defects and that the child will develop an autism spectrum disorder.[37][38]', 'Thalidomide is used to treat a type of cancer called multiple myeloma. It is well known that thalidomide carries a risk of severe birth defects when taken by a person who is pregnant. Thalidomide can also be transmitted to a fetus through semen. Contact with thalidomide before birth increases the risk a child will develop autism spectrum disorder.[39][40]', 'Misoprostol is used to prevent ulcers. It can also be used to induce labour and, in high enough doses, terminate pregnancy in its early stages. There is some evidence to suggest that misoprostol use in the first trimester of pregnancy could cause autism spectrum disorder.[41]', 'Rubella', 'When a pregnant person is exposed to rubella virus during the first trimester, the fetus has a high chance of developing congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). This condition can cause deafness, microcephaly, congenital heart disease and learning difficulties. Congenital rubella syndrome  is also associated with higher than usual incidences of autism spectrum disorder.[42][43]', 'CRS is very rare in the United States because of its policy for universal immunization against rubella. A study estimated that over 1,000 cases of autism spectrum disorder were prevented by rubella vaccination in the U.S. between 2001 and 2010.[44]', 'Older parents', 'Children born to older parents are more likely to develop autism, the risk heightening with the parents’ age. The risk increases significantly for each additional 10 years in maternal and paternal age.[45][46]', 'Birth spacing', 'A study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found a connection between autism spectrum disorder and the amount of time between births for each mother. The study found that children who were conceived less than 18 months or more than 59 months (4 years and 11 months) after the previous birth were more likely to develop autism.[47]', 'Autism and vaccines', 'There has been extensive research on vaccines and autism, and all scientific evidence indicates there is no link between autism and vaccines.[48][49][50][51]']","['There is no standard treatment for autism spectrum disorder. However, there are therapies available which aim to minimize the symptoms of autism and allow the person to function as well as they can.', 'Intervention and treatment can improve external symptoms and how a person copes with sensory and perception differences. However, how someone processes sensory information such as sounds and smells will always be different to people without the condition.[60]', 'Although treatment, particularly behavioral therapy and skills training, is most effective when started young, any person at any age can benefit from appropriate treatment. Which treatments are appropriate will depend on the person, what they have difficulty with and the severity of their symptoms.[61]', 'Early intervention for autism', 'In the U.S., early intervention services are available for children up to three years old with developmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder. These services focus on:[62][63]', '\nLanguage development\nHelp with walking and coordination\nInteracting with others\nRecognizing and managing emotions\n', 'Managing autism', 'There is no cure for autism spectrum disorder. However, people with autism can learn coping skills to help them function better on a day-to-day basis. Carers and others who interact with people with autism can also help by managing their own behavior and environment.', 'Therapy for autism', 'Therapy for autism spectrum disorder aims to decrease unwanted behaviors and increase wanted behaviors. There are various types of therapy available. The most appropriate will depend on the needs and symptoms of the person with autism. A medical professional will be able to offer guidance on which are likely to provide most benefit.', 'Many therapies involve the whole family, so that family members can learn how to support and help the person with autism. In young children, effective interventions should involve around 25 hours a week of active engagement.[22]', 'Therapies for autism spectrum disorder include:[22][61][62]', '\nCognitive behavior therapy (CBT): Helps people recognize the connection between thoughts, feelings and behaviors\nBehavioral management therapy: Uses various techniques to teach skills which improve social skills and reduce problematic behaviors\nOccupational therapy: Helps with skills, such as getting dressed or skills needed for employment\nSocial skills training: Can help children cope with conversations and other social interactions\n', 'Speech therapy for autism', 'Many people with autism spectrum disorder experience delays in learning to talk, with up to 50 percent being nonverbal. Being able to communicate by speech by the time a child goes to school has been linked to more positive outcomes as the child grows into adulthood. Early intervention is, therefore, important.[64]', 'Speech-language therapy can help a person with autism express needs, desires and feelings. It can also improve a person’s vocabulary and speed of speech.[65]', 'Managing challenging behaviors', 'If a person with autism spectrum disorder displays challenging behaviors, there are various courses of potential action to take:[66][67]', '\nHave the person tested to check for medical problems that could be causing distress\nBehavioral therapy\nReward positive behavior\nCommunicate simply, to minimize frustration\nReduce sensory overload\nOffer cues to redirect behavior such as verbal or gentle physical instruction\nProvide relaxation opportunities\nBe consistent and encourage others do the same\n', 'Some challenging behaviors can be mitigated by allowing the behavior, but changing an element to make it more socially acceptable. If a person smears feces because they enjoy the sensation, replace the feces with a substance such as Play-Doh or cornflour mixed with water. With pica, inappropriate items can be replaced with something edible and nutritious.[68][69]', 'Managing repetitive behavior in autism', 'Repetitive behaviors such as hand flapping or rocking may help a person with autism spectrum disorder. However, some repetitive behaviors, such as head banging, could cause the person harm. Other behaviors may cause distractions, such as in school or can be problematic if engaged in often to block out external sensory input.', 'Ways to manage unhelpful repetitive behavior include:[70][71]', '\nBehavioral therapy\nReplacing harmful activities with safer activities\nChange the environment to reduce distressing sensory input\nIntroduce other forms of stimulation, such as calming activities\n', 'Using visual cues to manage autism', 'People with autism are often highly reliant on routine. A visual timetable that shows what is going to happen during an activity, outing or a day can provide reassurance and prevent stress.', 'Pictograms and simple instructional diagrams in soft colors can provide information to people with autism spectrum disorder. Such signs can indicate what room a person is in, or how to operate an appliance or window.[72]', 'Visual supports can also provide a way to communicate for people with autism who are nonverbal. Cards of various colors or with simple pictograms can indicate a need, desire or mood.[73]', 'Toys for autism', 'People with autism spectrum disorder process sensory information, such as touch, sight, taste, sound and smell, differently from people without the condition. Certain toys can provide sensory feedback and, while not a treatment, may help a person with autism focus or feel relaxed.[74]', 'Examples of such toys include:', '\nFidget toys\nStress balls\nBubble wands or machines\nSorting and matching games\nToy trains\nJigsaws\nTactile books\nConstruction bricks\n', 'Autism-friendly spaces', 'As social awareness of autism spectrum disorder grows, more public places accommodate people with autism.

Medication is often used to manage a behavior if it threatens to cause harm to the person, such as head banging or slapping.', 'The FDA has approved aripiprazole and risperidone for use in autistic teenagers and children older than five years old. These medications can reduce hyperactivity and repetitive behaviors.[78][79]', 'Other medications that can be used to treat some symptoms of autism include:[80]', '\nAntidepressants, including tricyclics and SSRIs: Can reduce anxiety, irritability and aggression\nAnti-anxiety medication: Can reduce anxiety and panic\nStimulants: Can help increase focus for people with less severe symptoms\n', 'Treating gastrointestinal problems in autism', 'It is common to find gastrointestinal problems in people with autism spectrum disorder. Treatment involves diagnosing and treating the underlying issue which is causing the gastrointestinal distress.[13]', 'Exclusion diets, such as not eating gluten or casein, should not be used unless the person has a specific gastrointestinal problem, and dietary changes are recommended by a doctor. A large study found that, on the whole, children with autism that are given vitamin supplements do not need these supplements and may develop too-high levels of vitamins such as vitamin A and folate.[81][82]']"
['Baby Eczema'],"['Baby eczema, or infant eczema, is a highly common and treatable skin condition which typically\nfirst occurs in children before the age of five. Also known as atopic eczema, infantile atopic dermatitis or just atopic\ndermatitis, the condition results in red, dry, itchy and cracked skin that may sometimes\ncrack and bleed.[1] Eczema can affect the whole body, though the hands, face and neck are\nthe most commonly affected areas in babies.', 'Baby eczema will generally disappear before the child reaches their teens, but in some cases\ncan continue into teenage and adulthood. The condition can be treated with a variety of creams,\nointments and minor environmental changes.']","['Eczema in babies appears as dry, red, scaly, itchy and flaky skin. In young babies, the scalp,\nface, ears and neck are the most commonly affected areas. In older babies, the arms and legs\nmay be more commonly affected, especially around the elbows and knees, as well as the diaper\narea. [2] In severe cases, baby eczema can cause painful cracking of the skin, with oozing\nand bleeding. As children get older, the skin that is affected by the condition normally\nbecomes less red but scalier, leatherier and thicker – this is known as lichenification and\nmay also occur as a result of persistent scratching.[3]', 'If your baby is experiencing possible symptoms of baby eczema, carry out a symptom assessment with the free Ada app now.', 'Causes and triggers of baby eczema', 'The causes of baby eczema are unclear, though it is generally agreed that the condition\nstems from a mixture of genetic and environmental factors.[4] Knowing what triggers baby\neczema can be useful in keeping the condition under control. Common triggers include:', '\nDry skin: When the skin becomes too dry it becomes susceptible to rashes and flare-ups of eczema.\nMoisture on the skin: From sweat, milk, saliva or wet diapers.\nChemical irritants: Natural or artificial chemicals found in everyday products can\nmake an outbreak of eczema more likely. These chemicals can be found in products such as\nshampoo, soap, laundry detergent and disinfectants or surface cleaners.\nDust mites: Some research shows that prolonged exposure to dust mites increases the\nlikelihood of an infant developing eczema. Further research in the area suggests that\nreducing the number of dust mites in the home makes little difference to the frequency\nand severity of eczema flares after the first diagnosis.[5]\nStress: Babies can become extremely irritated by eczema which can in turn exacerbate\nthe condition further.\n', 'Diagnosing baby eczema', 'Diagnosing eczema in babies is relatively easy due to the visibility and characteristic\nappearance of the condition. A doctor will examine the baby and judge whether the symptoms\nare a result of eczema (atopic dermatitis or contact dermatitis, which results from exposure\nto allergens or irritants and can usually be treated quickly.', 'Baby eczema treatment', 'As soon as the presence of baby eczema becomes apparent, treatment options should be explored\nquickly to avoid the condition spreading or becoming more severe. Understanding and avoiding\nthe potential causes and triggers of baby eczema is key to managing the condition, but a\nvariety of further options are also available.[6] In particularly severe cases, a consultation\nwith a specialist dermatologist may be necessary.', 'Moisturizing ointments and creams', 'Using a moisturizing ointment or cream to keep the skin soft and moist is key to tackling\nbaby eczema.[7] Moisturizers are classified according to their oil and water content, with\nthe most effective moisturizers containing a higher amount of oil.', 'Ointments and barrier creams should be applied to the skin in a thick layer at least twice\nper day and immediately after bathing. They can be bought over the counter at the pharmacy\nor be prescribed by a doctor.', 'Topical Steroids', 'Mild topical steroids (steroids applied to the skin) can be used to reduce the redness and\nsoreness of baby eczema flare-ups.[8] These steroids are perfectly safe when applied correctly\nand under the guidance of a healthcare professional. They are, however, generally intended\nfor short-term use, unless otherwise advised by a doctor.', 'Soaps', 'Unscented, additive-free and dye-free cleansers only should be used on babies experiencing\neczema. A range of such products are available and should be used in conjunction with\nmoisturizing ointments or topical steroids. It is generally advised that a doctor’s opinion\nshould be sought before using these products.', 'Bathing', 'An appropriate bathing routine is critical to treating baby eczema. Baths are recommended\nover showers and should be warm rather than hot and last no longer than 10 minutes. They\nshould also be followed by the application of prescribed topical lotions and ointments.', 'Baby eczema FAQs', 'Q: Will my child grow out of eczema?\nA: In most cases, yes. Eczema generally develops in children from the age of two\nmonths-old and peters out by around three years-old. However, some children can experience\neczema into the teenage years and even into adulthood.[9]', 'Q: Are there any home remedies that can be used to treat baby eczema?\nA: There are a number of home remedies that can be used to treat some of the symptoms\nof baby eczema. However, it is generally a good idea to seek a doctor’s opinion and follow\nthe treatment path outlined. Bathing in water mixed with oatmeal, using a humidifier and\nthe application of coconut oil are among the most common home remedies.[10]', 'Q: What does the term “atopic” mean?\nA: Atopic (as in atopic eczema or atopic dermatitis) refers to a predisposition toward developing certain allergic hypersensitivity reactions such as eczema, asthma or hay fever.[1] Atopic eczema in babies and atopic dermatitis in babies are simply synonyms of baby eczema.', 'Q: What is dermatitis?\nA: Dermatitis is an umbrella term for a group of conditions that cause inflammation of the skin. Although the different types of dermatitis have differing causes, most involve the onset of red, itchy and dry skin or a rash. Baby eczema, or atopic dermatitis, is one form of dermatitis. Others include contact dermatitis (caused by the skin coming into contact with irritants) and seborrheic dermatitis (which can cause a flare-up of red skin, scaly patches and dandruff).[11]', 'Q: What is the relationship between food allergies and baby eczema?\nA: Food allergies are common in infants with eczema. However, they are separate conditions and it is not accurate to say that food allergies cause eczema. Instead, it appears that having eczema may increase the chances of an infant developing allergies to certain foods. A flare-up of both conditions may cause a rash or red, itchy skin, however, eczema is typically focussed on specific parts of the body (hands, face, neck) while an allergic reaction is more unpredictable.[12]', '', '\n\nBaby Centre. “Baby eczema: causes, symptoms, treatments and creams.” October, 2013.

The spots may resemble tiny bruises.[2]', 'The rash develops as small spots, which can occur in groups.[5] It is another important feature of the rash associated with bacterial meningitis that it does not go away/fade when pressed.', 'Good to know: The so-called glass test can be carried out to check whether the rash, that the affected person has, may be a meningitis-related rash. To do this, take a clear glass and press it against an area of skin affected by the rash. If it still visible when pressure is applied, it may indicate a meningeal infection and emergency medical help should be contacted.[2]', 'Risk factors and causes of bacterial meningitis', 'Newborn children are the population group at the highest risk of meningitis, although this condition can affect people of all ages. Males may be slightly more at risk than females. People with other medical conditions, including a recent ear or throat infection, or who have had a recent skull fracture, are at increased risk of meningitis.', 'How bacterial meningitis affects the brain and body', 'Meningitis occurs when bacteria invade the bloodstream,  cross the blood-brain barrier and infect the meninges, membranes that cover the brain and the spinal cord. The meninges are filled with a fluid called cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF. Usually, the blood and brain systems are seperate. Healthy CSF is sterile,[6] meaning it is free from bacteria or other microorganisms.', 'The bacteria that infect the meninges in bacterial meningitis can come from anywhere in the body,[1] and once they are in the CSF, they multiply, releasing toxins. This causes inflammation of the meninges and the brain, which increases intracranial pressure (ICP), i.e. pressure inside the skull. This increase in pressure causes many of the distinctive symptoms of meningitis,[7] including a stiff neck, headache and sensitivity to light.', 'Because of the blood-brain barrier, the body’s immune system battles to fight the infection, which causes great stress on the body. White blood cells and other elements of the immune system enter the CSF. The flow of blood components into the CSF means that the amount of blood flowing in the body is reduced, which affects the amount of oxygen available to the muscles and organs. The body tries to maintain its oxygen supply to the vital organs by reducing blood flow to the extremities, resulting in cold hands and feet.[7]', 'The spread of blood components into the CSF, along with the bacterial infection, can cause the brain to swell, a condition known as cerebral edema. Intracranial pressure increases, causing complications and, in some cases, death.[1]', 'Bacterial meningitis can result in complications that affect cognitive functioning if not treated in time and is often fatal if not treated. Concerned that you or someone you love might have meningitis?

These bacteria have to breach the immune system in order to cause an infection, and they tend to cause only isolated cases or small outbreaks.[2] These bacteria can be passed on by contact such as kissing, sneezing or coughing.', 'However, meningococcus is endemic to certain developing countries in Asia and Africa. It is a common cause of meningitis associated with overseas travel. Muslim pilgrims on the Hajj are particularly at risk.[3] Travellers to these regions should ask their physicians about the possibility of getting the meningococcus C vaccine; vaccinations against meningococcus A, W135 and Y may also be useful.', 'Pneumococcal meningitis', 'Severe pneumococcal infections are more common in developing countries.[4] Like meningococcus, pneumococcus can cause meningitis and septicemia,[7] but many people carry it harmlessly in their noses and throats, and infections can only happen if the bacteria breach the immune system.[2]', 'Meningitis caused by pneumococcus can be more severe than that caused by meningococcus, and is associated with somewhat higher mortality.[3] However, vaccines against pneumococcal meningitis are available.

You can do a free symptom assessment with Ada at any time.', 'Diagnosing bacterial meningitis', 'Diagnosis is based on the symptoms, the physical examination and tests which confirm the presence of a severe infection in the body. A sample of cerebrospinal fluid, the fluid in the meninges around the brain and spinal cord is taken and tested for the specific bacteria causing the infection. When bacterial meningitis is suspected, antibiotic therapy should be started right away.[1]', 'Lumbar puncture', 'Also known as a spinal tap, a lumbar puncture is a crucial part of the diagnostic process for bacterial meningitis. A lumbar puncture is done to obtain a sample of cerebrospinal fluid, which is then sent for laboratory testing. Lumbar punctures are usually quite safe, though may be a little tender or painful afterwards.', 'A lumbar puncture is done under local anesthetic, and a needle is inserted into a gap between two lumbar vertebrae in the lower back. A needle is used to draw off a small amount of fluid from around the spinal cord. The spinal cord itself is not touched.', 'Good to know: Some affected people, especially those who have already had a seizure, are at increased risk of high intracranial pressure. Performing a lumbar puncture on someone with highly elevated intracranial pressure increases the risk of brain herniation (see FAQs). These people will require a CT scan of the head first. The attending physicians will determine who may need a CT scan.', 'Blood and CSF tests', 'The CSF sample taken during the lumbar puncture will be analysed to confirm the presence of bacteria, determine what kind of bacteria are causing the infection, and determine how far along the infection is.', 'Blood tests may also be carried out to check organ function and dehydration. These results will guide the treatment.', 'Treating bacterial meningitis', 'Bacterial meningitis is a serious condition and requires urgent medical care. The infection is treated with intravenous (IV) antibiotics, i.e. through a drip. People with bacterial meningitis are often very sick and may need other supportive treatment, such as fluids to increase blood pressure while the antibiotics work to fight the infection. Most people with suspected bacterial meningitis will also be isolated after being admitted to hospital.', 'Antibiotic treatment of bacterial meningitis', 'Most cases of bacterial meningitis are treated with intravenous antibiotics administered as soon as possible. Because the treatment often begins before the exact bacteria responsible is identified, the antibiotics used may change. Also, as some of the bacteria that cause bacterial meningitis are becoming drug-resistant, several antibiotics may have to be tried before treatment is successful. Antibiotics commonly used to treat bacterial meningitis include:[1][3]', '\nCefotaxime\nVancomycin\nAmpicillin\nCeftriaxone\nPenicillin\nBenzylpenicillin\n', 'Good to know, although it is not an antibiotic, dexamethasone may be used in infants.', 'Supportive treatment for bacterial meningitis', 'People with meningitis will be treated as inpatients in hospital, and most will need to be in intensive care for a short time. They will be monitored for seizures, dehydration,[2] coughing or straining (which can increase intracranial pressure), pain, fever and hypotension (low blood pressure).[1] There is some evidence  that administering corticosteroids reduces inflammation, which decreases the risk of some complications.[3]', 'Complications of bacterial meningitis', 'Because meningitis involves a severe infection of the brain and the spinal cord, and also affects the body as a whole, complications are common.

However, everyone who presents with the symptoms of meningitis should seek urgent medical care, as it is not possible to tell whether meningitis is caused by bacteria or viruses just by looking at the symptoms.', 'Viruses that can cause aseptic meningitis include the flu virus, the common cold virus, the measles virus, and HIV, the mumps virus, as well as enteroviruses such as the polio virus.[13]', 'Q: What is the treatment for viral meningitis?\nA: Some people with severe viral meningitis may need to be hospitalized for a short period, but generally the treatment is aimed at relieving the symptoms. It is important to stay well-hydrated, and the pain and fever can be managed with acetaminophen/paracetamol or, in adults, aspirin.[14] However, everyone who presents with the symptoms of meningitis should seek urgent medical care, as it is not possible to tell whether meningitis is caused by bacteria or viruses just by looking at the symptoms.[15]', 'Some kinds of viral meningitis can be prevented by vaccines which prevent the diseases that can lead to viral meningitis. Diseases associated with viral meningitis, which a person can be vaccinated against, include the chickenpox, measles, mumps and influenza vaccines.', 'Q: Can meningitis be caused by fungi, parasites or amebas?\nA: Yes. Though rarer than viral or bacterial meningitis, fungi, parasites and amebas can all cause meningitis in some instances.', 'Fungal meningitis is rare in the developed world, but can be caused by Cryptococcus, Histoplasma, Blastomyces, or Coccidioides. Most of these fungal organisms are found in soil contaminated by bird or bat droppings. Candida, another fungus that can cause meningitis, is usually found in hospital settings. Fungal meningitis cannot be passed from person to person.[16]', 'Parasitic meningitis can be caused by parasitic nematodes (worms) and roundworms.[17] Most cases are found in people who have travelled to Southeast Asia and eaten contaminated meat or fish, seafood, eggs, snails or fresh produce washed in contaminated water. However, a roundworm called Baylisascaris procyonis is found in raccoon droppings in North America.[18] Parasitic meningitis is quite rare.', 'Amebic meningitis is very rare, but very serious. It is caused by a water-dwelling ameba called Naegleria fowleri, which is found in unchlorinated water, i.e. warm freshwater bodies such as lakes and swimming holes, bodies of water contaminated by warm industrial discharges, poorly-maintained swimming pools, untreated drinking water, or dirty water heaters. The organism requires warm conditions to survive, and cannot survive in saltwater.[19]', 'Q: Does Haemophilus influenzae cause the flu?\nA: No. Despite the name, viruses that cause influenza are not related to Haemophilus influenzae, which is a bacterium.[20] Influenza is a viral disease caused by a type of orthomyxovirus. Haemophilus influenzae was named by its discoverer during an influenza epidemic in the late 1800s; at that time, it was not known that viruses caused influenza, and the disease was thought to be caused by bacteria.', 'Q: Who is at risk from Listeria monocytogenes infection?\nA: Listeria monocytogenes is a bacterium that is often found as a food contaminant, and most cases of infection, also known as listeriosis, are the result of consuming contaminated food. It does not often cause meningitis, but as listeria-related meningitis has a high mortality, it is important to be vigilant about outbreaks of listeria. People at increased risk of developing meningitis after a listeria infection include:', '\nPregnant women\nInfants and young children\nPeople over 60 years of age\nAlcoholics\nImmunosuppressed individuals\nPeople with diabetes\nPeople with chronic kidney or liver disease.\n', 'Q: What is a brain herniation?\nA: A brain herniation occurs when high pressure or a change in pressure causes the brain, blood vessels within the brain, or cerebrospinal fluid to move out of their usual position.[21] The brain tissue may be pressed out through an injury in the skull or one of the skull’s natural internal openings, for example the foramen magnum, the hole in the base of the skull through which the spinal cord passes from the brain into the spine. Brain herniation is a serious medical condition, and treatment is essential. Neurological damage or death may result from a brain herniation.', 'Q: How is the risk of brain herniation minimized during the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis?\nA: The most common method of keeping the risk of brain herniation to a minimum is to give the affected person at CT scan before the lumbar puncture is carried out. CT scans are not generally considered to be a standard requirement in the diagnosis of meningitis, but they are an important precaution to prevent brain herniation following a lumbar puncture. People who have the following conditions may need to have a CT scan before a lumbar puncture can be carried out:[1][3]', '\nA history of stroke or other central nervous system problems\nSeizures within the previous seven days\nAltered or reduced consciousness\nA very severe headache\nA possible neurological deficit, such as nonreactive pupils or gaze palsy, a condition that affects the ability of the eyes to move in the same direction simultaneously.\n', '', '\n\nMedscape. “Meningitis”. 12 October 2017.

Most people with suspected bacterial meningitis will also be isolated after being admitted to hospital.', 'Antibiotic treatment of bacterial meningitis', 'Most cases of bacterial meningitis are treated with intravenous antibiotics administered as soon as possible. Because the treatment often begins before the exact bacteria responsible is identified, the antibiotics used may change.

['Bacterial Prostatitis'],"['Bacterial prostatitis is a condition in which a bacterial infection develops in the prostate gland. The prostate is a gland that sits under the bladder, and forms the first part of the urethra (the tube that carries urine away from the bladder). Older men with an enlarged prostate are commonly affected by bacterial prostatitis. Typical symptoms are fever, chills, burning sensation while urinating, difficulty to start urination, and pain around the anus. Treatment includes antibiotics, pain killers and, sometimes, a urinary catheter if emptying the bladder becomes difficult. With antibiotic treatment, many people recover well.']","['Common symptoms of bacterial prostatitis are fever, chills, a burning sensation while urinating, difficulty to start urination, and pain around the anus. Other symptoms are foul-smelling urine, weak urine flow, painful ejaculation and blood in the urine.']",,"['Bacterial prostatitis is treated with antibiotics. These are usually taken for 2-4 weeks. If the infection becomes persistent, longer courses of antibiotics or antibiotics through a drip (intravenous) may be needed. Pain can be managed with simple pain-relieving medication (paracetamol or ibuprofen). A urinary catheter (a tube) might be needed in case urination is difficult and very painful.']"
['Bacterial Sinusitis'],"['Bacterial sinusitis is a bacterial infection of the paranasal sinuses, the hollow spaces in the bones of the face around the nose. Sinusitis is a very common problem, affecting approximately one in every eight American adults annually. Almost 30 million people seek medical help for sinusitis in the USA every year.[1]', 'Bacterial sinusitis involves inflammation of the mucous membrane lining of the sinuses, and is caused by a bacterial infection. There are four pairs of paranasal sinuses which are located below, above, between and behind the eye sockets – the maxillary sinuses, frontal sinuses, ethmoid sinuses and sphenoidal sinuses. The maxillary sinuses are the largest of these, and are most often affected by sinusitis. However, sinusitis can affect any or all of the paranasal sinuses. Because sinusitis often occurs along with rhinitis, inflammation of the mucous membrane in the nose, it is sometimes known as rhinosinusitis.[2]', 'Bacterial sinusitis often follows a viral infection, such as a cold or the flu. Viral infections can cause the mucosal lining of the sinuses to swell.[3] In healthy sinuses, mucus drains into the nasal cavity via small holes, known as ostia. Swelling of the mucus membranes in the nose or sinus cavities can block these holes, preventing mucus from draining out of the sinuses. Bacteria colonize the undrained mucous, which can lead to bacterial sinusitis.[2]', 'Bacterial sinusitis may be treated with anti-inflammatory medications, and antibiotics as needed. Most cases of bacterial sinusitis resolve within two weeks, and have no further symptoms.', 'Signs and symptoms of bacterial sinusitis', 'Viral sinusitis and bacterial sinusitis', 'Viral sinusitis is the most common type of sinusitis. It is usually caused by the same viruses that cause the common cold, and typically lasts for between seven and ten days.[4] If the condition lasts longer than 10 days, or there is a worsening of symptoms after 5-7 days, the sinusitis is more likely caused by bacteria than a virus.[3]', 'Acute, subacute and chronic bacterial sinusitis', 'Bacterial sinusitis can be grouped into the following subtypes based on the duration of symptoms:[2][4][5]', '\nAcute, which lasts for less than four weeks\nSubacute, lasting for between four and 12 weeks\nChronic, lasting for more than 12 weeks\nRecurrent acute, occurring four or more times a year, for more than seven days, with symptoms resolving completely in between bouts\n', 'Symptoms of  bacterial sinusitis', 'Symptoms of  bacterial sinusitis include:[1][2][4][6]', '\nPressure or pain around the nose, in the forehead, in the cheeks or around the eyes.

The endoscopic examination is usually done in the doctor’s office. A nasal decongestant will be administered, and the nose will be numbed by an anesthetic spray. If the endoscopic exam is not helpful or if the doctor wants to carry out further examination, a computed tomography (CT) scan may be ordered. A CT scan can be helpful in assessing the sinuses and confirming the diagnosis in complicated cases.', 'Treatment', 'Most cases of bacterial sinusitis will get better without antibiotics, usually within 14 days.[4] Because of this, and because bacterial sinusitis is often caused by bacteria that are to some degree resistant to antibiotics, most doctors prefer that affected people initially try to manage the condition using home remedies and over the counter medications. Antibiotics are usually only prescribed for people who have severe or ongoing symptoms, or whose infection may be complicated by various other medical factors.

['Bacterial Vaginosis'],"['Bacterial vaginosis, also called bacterial vaginitis or BV, is an infection of the vagina caused by an imbalance of various types of natural vaginal bacteria. It is the most common cause of abnormal vaginal discharge and is estimated to affect as many as one in three women at some point in their lives.[1] BV can be a significant source of embarrassment and distress for affected women, but is relatively simple to treat using antibiotics. Long-term problems are rare as a result of bacterial vaginosis, but it can increase the risk of developing various sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV.[2]']","['Roughly 50 to 75 percent of women with bacterial vaginosis experience no symptoms. Among those who do, the most common symptom is milky, off-white or grey vaginal discharge, which is often described as having a fishy odour.

Some women, however, may experience vaginal itching.[2] The Ada app can help you to check your symptoms. Download the app now for a free symptom assessment or find out more here.']","['Bacterial vaginosis occurs when the distribution of vaginal bacteria becomes unbalanced. Normally, the vagina contains a mixture of bacteria, including anaerobic bacteria and lactobacilli. As a result of BV, anaerobic bacteria multiply and the amount of lactobacilli is reduced.[1][2] The precise reason as to why this happens is not known, though it is thought to involve a change in the acidity of the vagina.[1]', 'Bacterial vaginosis risk factors', 'A common misconception about bacterial vaginosis is that it is made more likely by poor vaginal hygiene: this is not true. Conversely, use of certain soaps may in some cases play a role.', 'Other factors that may contribute to the development of bacterial vaginosis include:[1]', '\nSexual activity\nFrequently changing sexual partners\nA history of sexually transmitted infections (STIs)\nSmoking\nUse of an intrauterine contraceptive device (IUD)\nBeing of Afro-Caribbean descent\nHaving heavy periods\nUse of bubble baths\nHormonal changes, including puberty, pregnancy and menopause\nUse of sex toys and lubricants\nUse of antibiotics\n', 'These factors make BV more likely; they do not guarantee that a person will develop the condition.

This will typically involve a short-course of antibiotics, which may be taken orally or applied directly to the vagina as a gel or cream. When taking antibiotics, always be sure to take the whole course, even if the problem clears up before this time.', 'The male sexual partner(s) of women with BV do not need to receive treatment. An estimated 30 percent of women experience a relapse of symptoms within 3 months of receiving treatment, and roughly 50 percent of women will relapse within 12 months.[2] A longer course of antibiotics will usually be required to treat a recurrent infection.']"
['Benign Mole'],"['Most moles are benign or harmless. Moles are types of skin growths or lesions, commonly referred to as a nevus (plural: nevi). Nevus is a generalised medical term for a visible, circumscribed, chronic lesion which sits on the skin or mucosa. They can take many different forms, including freckles, moles, skin tags and seborrheic keratoses.[1]', 'Typically, moles are pink, brown or tan in color with a distinct border. Moles usually develop within the thick layer of living tissue below the epidermis (outer layer of skin), which contains blood capillaries, nerve endings, sweat glands, hair follicles, and other structures. Moles occur when cells in the skin grow in a cluster, forming a lesion, instead of spreading out across the skin.[2]', 'Some moles develop from cells are called melanocytes, which make the pigment that gives skin its natural color. They can also develop from other cells, including nevus cells. The Ada app can help you check your symptoms. Download the free app or find out more about how it works.']",,"['Most moles are made of cells called melanocytes which make a pigment called melanin. Melanin has two principal functions: it helps to protect the body from ultraviolet light (UV radiation) from the sun and gives skin and hair its natural color. People with darker complexions have more of these cells, and are more likely to develop new moles after exposure to sunlight.[2]', 'Moles can occur anywhere on the body. They can be present at birth (congenital), but it is possible for them to develop throughout one’s lifetime (acquired). People can be born with moles, or develop new ones of any size and color throughout their lifetime, at any age. In general, however, darker skin types usually have darker moles.', 'Changes in benign moles', 'Environmental factors such as exposure to sunlight, and hormonal changes such as going through puberty or pregnancy can cause moles to darken or develop.', 'Therefore, the appearance of moles can change over time. They can change in number and appearance and can also fade away. It is important to familiarise oneself with the lesions on one’s body so as to establish their size, shape and type(s) are normal, as this may be different for every person. This will make it easier to spot atypical lesions or changes to lesions, which could indicate melanoma.', 'Changes in moles may require a visit to a doctor to determine if the mole is exhibiting dysplasia, i.e. becoming dysplastic. When a lesion becomes dysplastic, this is a sign that it contains abnormal cells or may be undergoing abnormal development.

Melanomas develop from melanin-containing cells, called melanocytes. People with fair skin, red or blond hair or who spend a lot of time in strong sunlight are at higher risk of developing melanoma. It is important to avoid prolonged sun or other UV radiation exposure to reduce the risk of developing dysplastic or cancerous moles.', 'Good to know: The most common types of non-melanoma skin cancer are basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma. The typical warning sign of non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma is a growth or sore that doesn’t heal, which should be checked by a doctor.', 'Read more about Melanoma »', 'Potential indicators that a mole is cancerous include:', 'Nevi with three or more different shades of brown or black are particularly likely to be dysplastic, indicative of melanoma or carcinoma.

The nevus may get bigger; enlargement is especially concerning if its diameter becomes larger than the eraser of a pencil.\nElevation/Evolution. The nevus may appear elevated, or raised from the skin, and may look inflamed, bleed or become crusty.\n', 'If a nevus suddenly begins to display any of these signs, it is important to have it examined by a dermatologist; a doctor who specialises in conditions that affect the skin. It is also vital to have nevi checked if they bleed, ooze, itch, appear scaly, or become tender or painful.', 'Treatment', 'If a dermatologist believes a melanocytic nevus needs to be evaluated further to find out whether it is cancerous, they will conduct a biopsy. This involves shaving or cutting it out so that it can be examined under the microscope.', 'If an atypical nevus is found to contain cancerous melanocytes, the dermatologist will remove the entire mole or scar from the biopsy site by cutting out the entire area, as well as a rim of normal skin around it. They will then suture the wound, i.e. stitch the wound to close it. This treatment is carried out to ensure that any melanoma-containing cells are removed in their entirety, preventing melanoma from spreading elsewhere in the body.', 'Removing benign moles', 'Even though benign moles do not pose health risks such as melanomas, many people opt to have them removed.

These can act as a “seed” and cause it to regrow. It is not possible to predict whether it will grow back. The chances of this are greatly reduced if care is taken to remove the subcutaneous cells during the initial procedure.', 'Q: Can a benign mole become cancerous?\nA: Melanomas can develop anywhere in the surface of the skin, including sites occupied by benign moles or within the melanocytic tissue of the mole itself. For this reason, it is important to consult a physician if a mole undergoes any changes, as these may be signs that it has become cancerous.', '**Q: Can a benign mole change color? **\nA: Yes. Most commonly, moles change color over time by getting darker after exposure to sunlight. This is not necessarily a cause for concern, but could indicate the presence of melanoma, so it is advisable to consult a doctor.

['Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo'],"['Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a common condition of the inner ear. This condition causes short episodes of dizziness (vertigo) associated with certain head movements. These episodes are caused by particles (crystals) irritating the semicircular canals, the part of the inner ear which regulates balance and equilibrium. Besides dizziness, people with BPPV feel nauseous and may vomit during these attacks. BPPV tends to get better over weeks or months, but may reoccur.']","['Recurrent, short attacks of dizziness are the main symptom of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. The dizziness associated with vertigo often feels like the world is spinning, rather than a feeling of lightheadedness. The dizziness may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting and a loss of balance. The attacks often occur after changing position of the head, such as suddenly turning the head, or moving from lying to sitting.']",,"['This form of dizziness can be treated with certain repositioning maneuvers (Epley maneuvers or Brandt-Daroff exercises). During these series of controlled exercises, symptoms may get worse. After being instructed by the doctor in how to do them, people can do some of these exercises at home.

It is used to look at the blood vessels and to detect any problems related to blood flow around the body.', 'Angiography and arteriography are slightly different imaging techniques which may be used interchangeably by one’s doctor. Arteriography is used to refer to techniques which produce images of the arteries, specifically. Angiography is an umbrella term used to describe the process of imaging all kinds of blood vessels.

Aneurysms are the result of a weakened blood vessel wall, which can occur due to high blood pressure weakening the arteries caused by external factors like major accidents , but is also often hereditary. When the weakened area bulges, it becomes filled with blood and is more likely to rupture. This can cause internal bleeding, serious complications and even, in case of a rupture, death. It is possible to have an aneurysm without knowing about it or perceiving any signs or symptoms.', 'A CT angiogram for aneurysms is usually performed as a way of ruling out an aneurysm, when unspecific symptoms or certain signs are in the foreground upon examination.

This can be life-threatening, as oxygen-rich blood will be prevented from reaching the lungs. Blood clots, which obstruct the lungs, usually form in the legs as a result of a condition called deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and travel up the body towards the pulmonary artery. Leading an active lifestyle to improve one’s blood circulation, avoiding smoking tobacco and drinking alcohol, and refraining from staying still for long periods (for example, on long-haul flights) can help prevent DVT.', 'Tumours', 'Before beginning treatment following the discovery of tumours, a doctor will often use CTA to investigate the arteries which are carrying blood to the tumour. It is important for the doctor to be able to visualise the blood vessels in the affected area when they are planning the treatment programme or deciding on a treatment.', 'Who is CTA suitable for?', 'In general, adults, children and even babies can undergo a CT angiogram without any adverse effects or complications. However, CTA is more commonly prescribed for adults, and is used to scan for a wider range of conditions in adults than in children or babies. CTA may not be suitable for people who are known to be allergic to contrast material.', 'Doctors may consider using alternative methods to CTA when they are examining people with one or more of the following characteristics:', '\nA history of allergic reactions to contrast material\nUnstable pulse or blood pressure\nImpaired kidney function\n', 'For people who are pregnant and/or who are undergoing radiation therapy to treat other conditions, the decision to prescribe a CT angiogram will be taken by the doctor, in discussion with the affected person, on a case-by-case basis.', 'Factors which will be taken into consideration include:', '\nThe type of angiogram\nThe condition(s) to be screened for\nThe cumulative (total) amount of radiation that the individual would be exposed to over the course of the total number of procedures that they are scheduled to undergo which involve radiation\nWhether the area of the body to be screened includes the womb and/or the unborn child\nThe timeline of the pregnancy: after 15 weeks, the foetus is considered to be sufficiently developed that the risks from the exposure to radiation, that a single scan involves, are thought to be negligible. (See FAQs.)\n', 'Preparation', 'A person who is scheduled for a CT angiogram may often be advised to avoid eating or drinking for a number of hours before the procedure. The exact length of this period depends on the body parts being examined and how extensive the angiogram will be. Talk to a doctor about the details of any forthcoming scan and follow their advice about how to prepare.', 'Please talk to the doctor beforehand about how to take prescribed or OTC medication  before the scan and on the day of the scan. Usually, there is no need to change one’s medication regimen before the scan.', 'On the day of the procedure, the person undergoing a CT angiogram will be asked to remove their clothing, jewelry and any other metal objects (such as a removable mouth-brace). A loose gown will be provided by the hospital. If they feel anxious about the scan, a sedative (medication which relaxes and calms individuals) may be provided. A sedative may also be prescribed if the person being scanned is a young child, or for anybody who experiences difficulties remaining still.', 'Contrast material', 'Almost all CT angiograms require the use of a contrast material. This is a dye which can be seen by X-ray equipment. For an angiogram, contrast material is injected into the body through a vein, making the blood vessels stand out from the rest of the image. Contrast material is normally harmless and passes out of the body during urination following the scan.', 'However, before administering contrast material, the doctor will check the clinical history of the individual to ascertain whether it is suitable. Contrast material may cause kidney damage in people who have previously experienced kidney problems. If a person has a history of asthma, or previous allergic reactions to contrast material, the chances of experiencing an adverse allergic reaction are heightened. Often, counter measures can be taken to ensure that these people are able to undergo an CT examination if needed.[4]', 'During the CTA', 'The CT scanner is made up of the scanning device (a large ring containing X-ray equipment) and a motorized bed. During a CT angiogram, the person lies down on the motorized bed of the scanner and remains as still as possible. The radiologist will operate the CT scanner from a separate room. The person undergoing CTA will be able to communicate with the radiologist throughout the procedure using an intercom. During the procedure, the person may be asked to breathe out or hold their breath at certain points to ensure the clarity of the images.', 'After the CTA', 'Following a CT angiogram, the images collected are processed by a computer. They will depict cross-sections (slices) of the body, in which the blood vessels under examination are differentiated from the rest of the image by the contrast material. The radiologist will analyse the images, taking into account the person’s medical history and any suspected diagnoses, and produce a radiology report. The report will usually be passed to the doctor who ordered the scan. It is normal to wait days, or in rare cases, even weeks to receive the results of a CT angiogram.', 'Almost all CT angiograms require the use of contrast material. Therefore a person who was injected with contrast material for a CT angiogram is usually asked to wait in the hospital for up to an hour so that they can be monitored for signs of an allergic reaction. It is important to drink plenty of fluids after the scan and over the following day to flush the contrast material out of one’s system. If a sedative was used, a family member or friend should accompany the affected person home, and they should avoid driving or operating machinery for the rest of the day.', 'CT angiography in comparison to regular and MRI angiography', 'For someone who has been prescribed an angiogram, there are several factors to consider in order to decide whether a CT angiogram is the most suitable option for their needs. The doctor will decide whether CT, MRI or regular angiography is suitable on a case-by-case basis.', 'Invasive or non invasive', 'One of the most important aspects of the experience to consider is whether the recommended scan will be an invasive or a non-invasive procedure.', 'Traditional angiography is an invasive procedure in which an incision is made in the skin so that the contrast material can be administered using a catheter, whilst X-rays are used to create the images. A local anaesthetic will be used to numb the area before the catheter is inserted. Catheters are thin, flexible tubes which are tailor-made for a range of different functions, like in this case administering the contrast material.', 'The other types of angiography — computed tomography (CT) angiograms and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) angiograms  — are non-invasive procedures. This means that they can be performed by injecting the contrast material into the relevant part of the body through a vein, without the need to use an anaesthetic. CT and MRI angiography are generally preferred by patients for these reasons in comparison to invasive, regular angiography.', 'Level of detail', 'An important advantage of CTA over regular angiography is that it is possible for the radiologist to view and evaluate bones, soft tissues and blood vessels all at the same time. This increases the possibility that a single angiography session will be enough to reveal everything that the doctor needs to know in order to accurately diagnose and therefore later on properly treat the affected person.', 'In the case of coronary artery disease (CAD)  using CT angiography was shown to be more sensitive and also more specific than an MRI angiography. This means that that the coronary artery disease will be more likely properly diagnosed with CT angiography. Furthermore when CT angiography is used to screen for CAD, this allows the radiologist to perform a scan using less contrast material than an MRI angiography would require.[5]', 'However, in general, the suitability of CT or MRI angiography depends on the body part being scanned and the condition(s) to be screened for.', 'What can be accomplished during each scanning procedure?', 'A CT angiogram can be used for diagnosis or investigation. A separate treatment plan must be devised based on the findings.', 'For this reason, somebody who is undergoing a coronary angiogram because of a possible problem with their heart may, in some cases, be recommended a regular angiogram rather than a CT coronary angiogram. CTA is generally preferred by patients as the quicker and less painful option for a scan.', 'However, use of a catheter in regular angiography makes it possible to sometimes combine diagnosis and treatment in a single procedure. It is for example possible to identify and treat an aneurysm or restore blood flow to a part of the body by removing a blood clot or blockage via the catheter during the scan itself with a regular coronary angiography – avoiding the need for further treatment.', 'CTA FAQs', 'Q: Is CTA safe?\nA: The radiation-related risks associated with CTA are far outweighed by the benefits. CTA gives doctors the ability to make rapid and accurate diagnoses and prescribe appropriate treatments for otherwise harder-to-identify conditions. However, care must still be taken to minimize the exposure to radiation from the X-ray equipment. Being exposed to X-rays is often associated with an increased risk of developing cancer later on.', 'It is advisable to limit the number of X-rays performed on a single person — including those associated with CTA  — to those which are absolutely necessary. However, CT scanners have sophisticated radiation dose controls to minimize the risk of developing cancer as much as possible. Furthermore, it is possible to opt for a low-dose radiation X-ray in all cases where a lesser quality CT angiogram will be sufficient to make a diagnosis.', 'Q: Is CTA suitable for someone who is pregnant?\nA: In the early stages of pregnancy, the foetus is most at risk of experiencing adverse effects from being exposed to the ionizing radiation involved in CTA. For this reason, it is recommended that pregnant women do not undergo CTA during the first fifteen weeks of their pregnancy, if the purpose of the scan is to produce an angiogram showing a section of the body which includes the gravid uterus (the area containing the foetus).', 'From fifteen weeks post-conception, the foetus is considered to have developed sufficiently for there to be a negligible risk of damage from exposure to the ionizing radiation involved in a single scan. At this point, it is generally considered that the risk of damage to the unborn child is outweighed by the benefits of performing a CT angiogram in order to diagnose and treat any conditions which may affect the mother and unborn child if left untreated. There is no reason for a pregnant woman to avoid contrast material at any point in the pregnancy, so intravenous contrast material can be administered as needed.[6]', 'Q: Is CTA suitable for children\nA: Due to technological advances, contemporary CTA can be performed even on newborn children. The range of reasons that CTA is usually performed on children is narrower than for adults. In children, CTA is most often used to assess congenital diseases (birth defects), postoperative vascular diseases (abnormal conditions that can develop in the blood vessels and veins as a result of surgery) and cardiac diseases. One advantage of performing CTA on children is that it can be possible to avoid long periods of sedation, which are associated with MRI angiography and reduce high-intensity radiation exposure, which is associated with regular angiography.[7] If you are concerned about the health of you or a loved one, get a free symptom assessment with the Ada app.', '', '\n\n“Global, regional, and national life expectancy, all-cause mortality, and cause-specific mortality for 249 causes of death, 1980-2015: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015.” The Lancet. 08 October 2016. ↩\n\n“Heart Disease Fact Sheet.” Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. 23 August 2017. ↩\n\n“Coronary Artery Disease - Coronary Heart Disease.” American Heart Association.

The symptoms of CTS are often worst at night and absent during the day.', 'In most cases, the exact cause of CTS is unknown, but it usually develops in adulthood and is often attributed to work-related activities such as typing and other repetitive movements, such as mopping, sweeping or using vibrating tools. The risk of CTS is increased in people experiencing arthritis, thyroid conditions and pregnancy.', 'Around 60 percent of people affected by CTS experience the condition in both wrists (bilateral CTS). CTS which only affects one wrist is called unilateral CTS. In both bilateral and unilateral CTS, the dominant hand is usually first and/or more strongly, affected.[3]', 'CTS  caused by pregnancy often goes away on its own when the pregnancy concludes. Likewise, CTS that is caused by a medical condition usually goes away on its own when the condition is managed effectively.', 'To treat CTS, some people may find it helpful to wear a wrist splint at night to hold the wrist in a still position and use OTC or prescription medications to manage the pain and inflammation of CTS. For others, surgery may be necessary to alleviate the condition.']","['The symptoms of CTS are usually worse at night and may be absent during the day. They can be intensified or brought on by forceful activities involving the wrist, especially the use of vibrating tools and heavy lifting. The most common symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome are:[4]', '\nNumbness and tingling in the thumb, index finger, middle finger and the radial half of the ring finger (the half of the ring finger closest to the palm, which is supplied by the median nerve). This can result in atrophy of the affected muscles (which may appear flattened).\nBurning pain in the wrist\nLoss of grip strength and dexterity\n', 'Proximal radiation (the sensation that the pain has radiated to nearby areas) is a less common, but not unusual, symptom of CTS. People may experience pain related to CTS in other parts of the arm, namely:', '\nThe volar forearm; the side of the forearm that is on the same side as the palm of the hand\nThe medial arm; the skin on the side of the arm where the medial brachial cutaneous nerve is\nThe shoulder\n', 'The symptoms of CTS worsen the longer the condition is left untreated. If a person is affected by CTS for several months, they may begin to feel numbness in the hand on a permanent basis and lose the ability to feel hot and cold sensations with the hand.', 'Seek medical attention promptly if any of the symptoms of CTS are present, in order to diagnose and begin treating the condition  at an early stage.', 'Acute carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS)', 'Acute carpal tunnel syndrome is a version of CTS in which the median nerve is severely crushed, usually as the result of an injury or chronic health condition. Unlike regular CTS, acute CTS requires urgent surgical intervention to prevent serious health consequences, such as the permanent loss of sensation or movement in the affected area.[5]', 'Factors which are associated with the development of acute CTS include:[5]', '\nFractures and fracture dislocations around the wrist\nVascular disorders (diseases affecting the blood vessels)\nHemorrhagic conditions (conditions relating to abnormal blood flow or clotting)\nRheumatologic disorders (conditions relating to pain and stiffness in the body, such as arthritis and Crohn’s disease)\nAnomalous anatomy (atypical wrist or nerve structure)\n']","['Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by the median nerve (the nerve which controls sensation and movement in the hands) becoming compressed. Any medical conditions and/or injuries which cause swelling in the wrist can reduce the amount of space inside the carpal tunnel, causing pressure to be exerted on the median nerve and activating the symptoms of CTS.', 'The biological cause of CTS within the carpal tunnel is the swelling of a protective lining of tendons called the tenosynovium. This sets off a chain of related changes within the carpal tunnel:[6]', '\nThe swelling of the tendons is understood to cause a buildup of synovial fluid; the fluid which normally protects and lubricates the tendons; within the carpal tunnel.\nIn reaction to this buildup of fluid, a band across the top of the carpal tunnel called the transverse ligament becomes thicker and broader.\nThe swelling and the enlarged transverse ligament exert pressure on the median nerve, depriving it of the blood supply and oxygen it needs in order to function normally. This causes the median nerve to become damaged and the symptoms of CTS to develop.\n', 'The medical or circumstantial basis for these developments occurring in the carpal tunnel is unknown in many cases, and there is no test available to identify a specific cause. However, the development of CTS may be caused by factors including:[1]', 'Work-related activities', 'In particular, CTS may be attributed to activities which involve repetitive movements, heavy lifting and using vibrating tools. Professional activities which are particularly associated with CTS include assembly work, farming, sewing, cleaning, and meat packing.', 'Heredity', 'People born with smaller bone structures are more likely to have wrist and bone structures in which the median nerve is susceptible to the compression that causes CTS. A genetic predisposition to any of the many medical conditions which are linked to CTS may be described as the indirect cause of CTS in a person who develops CTS as a result of another medical condition.[7]', 'Medical conditions', 'Musculoskeletal disorders (conditions affecting the muscles and/or skeleton) and autoimmune diseases may trigger the development of CTS by causing inflammation in the hands and wrists. The main medical conditions which are linked to CTS are diseases of the thyroid gland, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic kidney insufficiency, Down syndrome, osteoarthritis and obesity. If CTS is caused by a medical condition, it may be alleviated by effectively treating the causal condition.[6] Feeling unwell? Get a free symptom assessment by downloading the Ada app.', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant women sometimes develop CTS due to hormonal changes and fluid retention. If CTS is caused by pregnancy alone, it will often go away when the pregnancy ends. Rest, ice, elevation and exercise may all help to alleviate the symptoms of CTS during pregnancy.[8]', 'Medications', 'The use of some medications has been linked to CTS, but more research is needed to understand the mechanisms by which these may cause CTS to develop. Medications which have been linked to CTS include:[6]', '\nMedications which affect the immune system (such as interleukin-2)\nMedications which prevent blood clotting (such as warfarin)\n', 'Risk factors', 'Certain risk factors increase a person’s likelihood of developing CTS. These include occupational factors such as working in a role that necessitates intensive and/or repetitive use of one’s hands, and non-occupational factors, such as medical conditions like diabetes and hypothyroidism which may cause CTS.', 'Risk factors for CTS include:[2]', 'Pregnancy', 'CTS is a common complication of pregnancy, due to fluid retention, edema and hormonal changes within the body. One’s likelihood of developing CTS in pregnancy, and the severity of the condition, increases with age. Most people who develop CTS during pregnancy find that it alleviates on its own when the pregnancy concludes.', 'Read more about Pregnancy »\nRead more about Pregnacy Complications »', 'Being female', 'According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, women are three times more likely than men to develop CTS.[1]', 'Menopause', 'The hormonal changes that accompany menopause can cause a buildup of fluid in the body, increasing the risk of developing CTS. Women, whose hormone levels alter excessively during pregnancy, are more likely to develop CTS in later life, after undergoing menopause, than those whose hormonal changes during pregnancy are within the normal range.[9]', 'Inflammatory arthritis', 'CTS is a common complication of arthritis, due to the swelling of joints and tendons associated with the condition.[10]', 'Being middle-aged or elderly', 'The likelihood of developing CTS increases with age, particularly after 70. In part, this is due to the fact that most musculoskeletal disorders predominantly affect older people, and CTS is a common consequence of these conditions.[11]', 'Diabetes', 'Between 15 and 20 percent of people with diabetes will develop CTS, which is believed to be due to having high blood sugar levels. Diabetes is often linked to the development of problems with the nerves, such as diabetic neuropathy. In people with diabetes, when blood sugar levels are high, glucose is believed to attach to the tendons. This causes compression within the carpal tunnel as the tendons enlarge, resulting in CTS.[12]', 'Read more about Diabetes »', 'Diseases of the thyroid', 'People with improperly-managed thyroid conditions may retain excess fluid in their connective tissues. This contributes to inflammation within the wrist, which can cause CTS, especially if left untreated. Hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid) is particularly linked to CTS, but people with hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid) are also more likely to develop CTS than the general population.[13]', 'Read more about Hypothyroidism »\nRead more about Hyperthyroidusm »', 'Heredity', 'People with a sibling or parent with CTS are more likely to be affected than those without. A person’s bone structure and overall size is largely determined by their genetic makeup, and those with smaller frames have less space in their carpal tunnels, which significantly increases the likelihood of the median nerve becoming trapped and their developing CTS.[7]', 'Using tobacco products', 'A link has been found between the use of tobacco and developing CTS. Tobacco products negatively affects the body’s immune system and increases a person’s risk of developing inflammatory diseases which can cause a buildup of fluid in the carpal tunnel, which may result in CTS.[14]', 'Injuries to the wrist', 'It is possible for the median nerve to become compressed due to changes in the structure of the bones and muscles in the wrist that result from injuries. People who play a lot of sports are particularly at risk of hand and wrist injuries that can result in CTS. In injury-related CTS, ensuring that the injury heals properly and that the median nerve ceases to be entrapped will alleviate the condition.[15]', 'Working intensely with one’s hands', 'CTS is often linked to activities involving repetitive hand and wrist movements, in particular, the use of vibrating tools.', 'Diagnosis', 'To diagnose CTS, a doctor will usually perform a physical exam on the hand(s) and wrist(s) and ask about the symptoms a person has been experiencing. The purpose of the physical exam is to find out whether a person is experiencing physical sensations that typically relate to the median nerve being compressed.', 'If these sensations are not present, this can rule out a diagnosis of CTS and the possibility that a person is affected by another condition can be investigated. During the physical exam, doctors look out for:', '\nWeak muscles surrounding the thumb (which can happen in cases of CTS due to underusing these muscles in order to avoid the pain that often accompanies movement)\nTinel’s sign which involves tingling and numbness in the fingers when the wrist is tapped at the palm side of the hand (this alone is insufficient for a CTS diagnosis, as it is also a possible symptom of many other conditions)\nA positive Phalen’s maneuver which invilves pain, numbness or tingling in the wrist and fingers when the wrist is flexed to the hand’s maximum ability\n', 'Further testing', 'Further testing is usually needed, even if all of these symptoms are present, in order to confirm a diagnosis of CTS. This may involve:', 'Nerve conduction test', 'Damaged nerves cannot transmit signals to the body parts in order to bring about certain actions as quickly as healthy nerves can. Nerve damage is a common result of CTS. To detect it, the doctor will attach electrodes to the hand and wrist to stimulate the nerves in the fingers and wrist with an electric current.', 'The speed with which the signal can travel through the nerves will be indicative of the extent of any nerve damage, and can support or discredit a diagnosis of CTS. This test usually takes around 10 minutes to perform, and can be moderately uncomfortable because it produces an unfamiliar tapping/tingling sensation.', 'Imaging study', 'Doctors may perform an ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan in order to visualize the median nerve and carpal tunnel and determine their exact positions and the extent of the nerve entrapment.', 'Blood testing', 'To rule out other conditions which also have symptoms of pain, numbness and tingling in the hand/wrist, including diabetes, diseases of the thyroid and arthritis, doctors may perform a blood test.', 'Other conditions which may be misdiagnosed as CTS', 'Carpal tunnel syndrome is frequently misdiagnosed due to the fact that it shares symptoms with several other conditions, including arthritis, wrist tendonitis, repetitive strain injury (RSI) and thoracic outlet syndrome. Symptoms which CTS shares with other conditions include:', '\nTingling\nPain\nNumbness\nHot-and-cold sensations\nDifficulty grasping or using one’s hand\n', 'It is important to be aware of the key differences between CTS and some other conditions which share its symptoms, in order to avoid a misdiagnosis. Other conditions which are commonly misdiagnosed as CTS include:', 'Arthritis', 'Arthritis can affect all the fingers in the hand, whereas CTS cannot affect the little (pinky) finger. Whereas CTS is worse at night, arthritis is not affected by the time of day. The symptoms of CTS can be absent and then suddenly become triggered by a particular activity, whereas the pain associated with arthritis is usually constantly present but alters in intensity during activities which put strain on the hands and wrists.[16]', 'Read more about Arthritis »', 'Nerve compression due to conditions affecting the spine', 'Conditions such as spinal disc herniation (a slipped disc) and cervical stenosis (a condition characterised by weakness and numbness that may affect areas including the spine, neck, shoulders, hands, arms and legs) can cause nerve compression that may result in similar sensations to those of CTS.', 'Wrist tendonitis', 'In wrist tendonitis, the area affected by symptoms may be different to that of CTS. The pain, numbness and tingling may affect the tendons in any part of the hand or wrist, whereas in CTS the symptoms are limited to the thumb, index and middle fingers, the palm side of the wrist and the radial half of the ring finger.', 'Thoracic outlet syndrome', 'In thoracic outlet syndrome, blood vessels or nerves in the space between the collarbone and the first rib become compressed. The pain can affect the shoulders and neck, as well as the fingers. The fingers which are usually affected are the little (pinky) finger and the non-radial half of the ring finger. These are the two areas that cannot be affected by the symptoms of CTS.[17]', 'Repetitive strain injury (RSI)', 'This is a general term to describe symptoms including pain, throbbing and stiffness in the muscles and tendons as a result of overuse and repetitive movements.[18] RSI can occur anywhere in the body, but most often affects the neck, shoulders, forearms, elbows, hands and wrists. When it occurs in the hand and wrists, RSI may be mistaken for CTS, but unlike CTS, RSI is capable of affecting any part of the overall area.', 'Treatment of CTS', 'Carpal tunnel syndrome may disappear on its own without treatment. If CTS is caused by another condition such as arthritis or an underactive thyroid, its symptoms may alleviate on their own when the causal condition is treated.', 'If one’s carpal tunnel syndrome is not caused by another treatable medical condition, it is best to begin treatment as soon as possible to prevent the symptoms worsening and to reduce the level of damage to the median nerve associated with continuous pressure.', 'For those with mild symptoms, and/or who have been affected for a short time, non-surgical treatments such as wrist splinting and medications may be sufficient. In more severe cases, or where the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome cannot be alleviated by non-surgical means, surgery to relieve pressure on the median nerve may be recommended.', 'In pregnant women, the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome often abate in the weeks after the pregnancy ends, with no need for treatment. Those who are still experiencing symptoms of CTS three months after the conclusion of the pregnancy should seek medical attention to devise a treatment plan.[19]', 'Wrist splinting', 'Wrist splinting is a common first-line treatment for mild to moderate CTS. It involves wearing a splint at night for a few weeks in order to hold the joint in a neutral position. This helps to prevent the symptoms of CTS from developing overnight, when the pain is usually worse.', 'Wrist splints come in many different shapes and sizes and a doctor can recommend a suitable one. A wrist splint works by preventing the hand from bending in way which brings on the symptoms of CTS during the night. However, because the wrist is kept in a fixed position by the splint, it is important to exercise the hand and wrist during the day to prevent the muscles from weakening due to underuse.', 'The effects of wrist splinting usually become noticeable after a few weeks of wearing the splint. In some cases, this is a sufficient treatment for CTS and symptoms will disappear.', 'However, for many people, splinting is a temporary solution rather than an effective treatment for CTS, and symptoms may return. In this case, other treatment options such as medications or surgery may be recommended.[20]', 'Medications for CTS', 'Medications that are prescribed in the management of CTS can provide temporary relief from the pain and inflammation associated with the condition. The medications most commonly prescribed for CTS are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as ibuprofen and, in more severe cases of CTS, corticosteroids, which are taken as tablets or injected into the carpal tunnel.', 'NSAIDs are available as over-the-counter or prescription medication, and can temporarily minimize joint and muscle pain. Naproxen and ibuprofen are the NSAIDs most commonly used for pain management in CTS. Long-term use of NSAIDs carries multiple health risks, including impaired gastroenteric function and increased likelihood of peptic ulcer disease. NSAIDs should be taken for a limited period of time only, in consultation with a medical professional.', 'Corticosteroids can be taken orally as tablets or injected into the carpal tunnel. Local injections are considered to be more effective than oral corticosteroids at reducing the pain and inflammation associated with CTS. Corticosteroids may be prescribed in cases of severe CTS, and/or when wrist splinting has not provided long-term relief.[21]', 'Short-term use of corticosteroids (for example, for a few weeks or a month) is associated with a variety of side effects, including stomach problems, skin problems and weight gain, which may render them an unsuitable treatment option for some people.', 'Continuous (longer-term) use of corticosteroids is never recommended for the treatment of CTS as it is associated with increased risk of the development or worsening of a variety of health conditions such as diabetes and osteoporosis.', 'Medications help manage the painful symptoms of CTS, rather than treating the cause. Neither NSAIDs nor corticosteroids can relieve the pressure on the median nerve and these medications can therefore only provide temporary relief from the symptoms of CTS. Medications should be used as part of a wider treatment strategy which focuses on releasing the entrapped median nerve.', 'Surgery', 'Surgery for CTS will not usually be considered as a first-line treatment, and is usually recommended only when CTS is at a late stage and/or has not been alleviated by non-surgical treatments. Urgent surgery for CTS is usually only needed as a treatment for acute CTS.', 'Surgery for CTS involves cutting a part of the carpal tunnel in order to reduce pressure on the median nerve. The part of the carpal tunnel which is cut during surgery is known as the flexor retinaculum. There are two possible surgical procedures for CTS: endoscopic carpal tunnel release and open carpal tunnel release.[22]', 'Both types of surgery can be performed as an outpatient procedure and usually only require a local anesthetic to numb the hand or arm.', 'Endoscopic carpal tunnel release involves making a small incision in the palm and/or the wrist, and a small camera called an endoscope is inserted into one of the incisions to monitor the procedure. The flexor retinaculum is then cut with an instrument inserted into the second incision. It is also possible to perform the procedure by making only one incision in the wrist, and inserting both the surgical instrument and the endoscope into the same incision.', 'Open carpal tunnel release involves cuting the inside of the wrist to reveal the carpal tunnel.

If RSI affects the tendons or ligaments in the carpal tunnel, this can cause compression on the median nerve and the development of CTS. However, research has shown that there is at most a very small direct link between computer work and CTS. Activities which involve using the hands and wrists with a greater intensity, such as using vibrating tools, are significantly more likely to cause CTS than typing. The use of ergonomic computer keyboards is, however, sometimes recommended as a preventative measure against developing CTS.[20]', 'Q: Can children be affected by CTS?\nA: CTS in children is rare. When it develops, it is most commonly related to having a genetically inherited condition associated with inflammation, such as lysosomal storage disease, which can cause swelling in the joints and pressure to build up in the carpal tunnel. The symptoms of CTS and its treatment options are the same for children as for adults.[25] If you are concerned that your child, or a child that you know, may be affected by CTS, you can get a free symptom assessment by downloading the Ada app.', '', ""\n\n“Carpal tunnel syndrome fact sheet.” National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. 10 May 2017.

This clumping is commonly a result of aging, yet it is not clear why some people and not others are affected.', 'There are, however, some factors that may increase an individual’s chances of developing cataracts, including:[6]', '\nExposure to ultraviolet radiation, from sunlight or radiation therapy\nDiabetes\nEye conditions like uveitis and glaucoma\nEye injury or surgery\nUse of corticosteroids\nA family history of cataracts\n', 'Other factors that are also thought to be linked to the development of cataracts include:', '\nSmoking\nAlcohol\nThe abuse of illicit substances\nVitamin deficiency. See these resources on vitamin D deficiency, vitamin K deficiency and vitamin B12 deficiency for more information.\n']","['If the symptoms of cataracts are mild, an altered prescription, i.e. for different glasses or contact lenses, may be effective in correcting an individual’s vision. However, it is typical for cataracts to worsen over time. If this happens, it is likely that surgery will be necessary.[8]', 'Cataracts surgery is a common procedure and usually carried out under local anaesthetic. Most people who undergo cataract surgery will see a significant improvement in their vision, with 9 out of 10 people achieving between 20/20 and 20/40 vision afterwards. However, most surgeons will focus on correcting long-distance sight, meaning glasses may still be needed to see things close at hand.', 'Good to know: The terms 20/20 and 20/40 are visual acuity measurements.', 'This is usually measured using the Snellen visual acuity system:', '\nThe top number of the fraction refers to the viewing distance between the patient and the eye chart.\nThe bottom number of the fraction refers to the distance at which a person with ideal vision would be able to see the figures on the eye chart clearly.\n', 'A person with 20/40 vision can therefore see figures on the eye chart clearly at a distance of 20 feet, whereas a person with ideal vision could see the same figures clearly, from a distance of 40 feet away from the eye chart.', 'In the United States, the distance at which visual acuity is measured, is typically 20 feet. In other countries, this distance is generally six meters, and a person’s visual acuity may therefore be expressed as a fraction of six.', 'Risks', 'The risk of complications during and after cataract surgery is small. The most common complication is posterior capsule opacification (PCO) brought about when skin or membrane grows over the implanted lens, resulting in a return of clouded or impaired vision. PCO can be corrected with laser surgery.[8]', 'There are other risks that are far less common. Risks during the operation include:', '\nTearing of the lens\nInability to remove the cataracts\nBleeding of the eye\nAccidental damage to other areas of the eye\n', 'Risks following the operation include:', '\nInflammation of the eye\nRetina swelling\nCornea swelling\nRetinal detachment\nInfection\n', 'If complications become apparent after surgery, a doctor should be contacted as soon as possible.

['Causes of Miscarriage'],"['A miscarriage is a fairly common complication of early pregnancy, in which the developing embryo or fetus dies in the womb of natural causes, or due to exposure to substances, i.e. in certain medications, which are unsuitable for use during pregnancy. The term miscarriage is used to describe this process when it happens during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy:', '\nA miscarriage which occurs in the first trimester (weeks 1-12 of pregnancy) is known as an early miscarriage\nA miscarriage which occurs in the second trimester (during weeks 13-20 of the pregnancy) is known as a late miscarriage\n', 'Loss of the fetus which occurs after week 20 of pregnancy is known as a stillbirth, or fetal death.', 'Most miscarriages are early miscarriages, and are caused by factors including:[1][2]', '\nChemical pregnancy, when the fertilized egg fails to implant in the uterine (womb) lining, and the pregnancy can only be evidenced by measuring levels of the pregnancy hormone, hCG, which will be detectable in blood or urine pregnancy tests. The embryo does not develop sufficiently to be visible on an ultrasound scan.\nChromosomal (DNA) abnormalities, which are present in the fetus.\nProblems with the placenta, the organ responsible for the exchange of nutrients and gases between the pregnant person and the fetus.\n', 'Certain long-term health conditions, particularly immunological disorders, such as diabetes or systemic lupus erythematosus, may cause early or late miscarriage. (See the section on miscarriage caused by long-term health conditions and immune disorders.)', 'The typical causes of late miscarriages tend to be different from the causes of early miscarriages. The leading causes of late miscarriage include:[2]', '\nAdverse reactions to medications\nDiseases and infections, such as toxoplasmosis or rubella\nFood poisoning\nEnvironmental factors, such as exposure to radiation\nWomb or cervical dysfunction\n', 'More rarely, miscarriage can be caused by other factors, including histamine intolerance, fibroids or psychological stress.', 'It is also possible for a miscarriage to be caused by treatable conditions; for example, fertility issues affecting one or both parents. (See the section on diagnosing and treating causes of miscarriage.)', 'Age and miscarriage', 'Being older increases the likelihood of miscarrying, in both the first and second trimesters. The older a person is, the more likely it becomes that their pregnancy will result in a miscarriage:[2]', '\nIn women under 30, only 1 in 10 pregnancies end in miscarriage\nIn women over 45, more than half of all pregnancies end in miscarriage\n', 'The older either parent is, the more likely it is that the developing fetus will be vulnerable to other causes of miscarriage, which renders age the leading cause of miscarriage overall. In particular, the risk of conceiving an embryo with chromosomal abnormalities, which may lead to miscarriage, increases with age.', 'The risk of miscarriage increases after the approximate age of 35 for women, and 40 for men. Notwithstanding the increased risk of miscarriage, it is possible to have a healthy pregnancy after these ages.', 'Chemical pregnancy', 'In a chemical pregnancy, the fertilized egg fails to implant properly in the uterine (womb) lining and/or survive in the uterus. Miscarriages caused by chemical pregnancy occur very early in pregnancy, usually at around week five of pregnancy, before the fetal heartbeat would be detectable via an ultrasound scan.', 'It is possible for a person to be unaware of their chemical pregnancy and of miscarrying. Many early miscarriages go unnoticed because the symptoms of early miscarriage, such as abdominal pain and/or vaginal blood loss, are not usually severe. They may therefore be perceived as normal menstruation.', 'Good to know: Many forms of birth control (contraception), such as the combined pill or progesterone-only mini pill work to thin the lining of the womb. These medications are usually taken intentionally to prevent pregnancy. One way in which they do this is by stopping the fertilized egg from implanting. When a fertilized egg does not implant due to the effective use of birth control, this is not considered a chemical pregnancy.', 'Chromosomal abnormalities', 'Chromosomal abnormalities are the most common cause of early miscarriage. They are detected in 50 to 85 percent of miscarried pregnancy tissue, which, as standard practice, is usually analyzed after a miscarriage takes place, to help determine the cause.[3]', 'Most people have 23 pairs of chromosomes. Chromosomes are basically blocks of DNA; the mechanism by which parents pass their genes onto their offspring, determining characteristics like hair and eye color and the possibility of carrying – or being affected by – hereditary diseases like sickle cell disease.', 'The male sex cell (sperm) and the female sex cell (egg) each carry 23 chromosomes. A normal fertilized egg (zygote) has 23 pairs of chromosomes and is equipped to develop into a healthy embryo, which in turn develops into a fetus as the pregnancy progresses. An embryo becomes a fetus at around eight weeks into the pregnancy, at which point all major body parts are present.', 'If an embryo has more or fewer than 23 pairs of chromosomes, this is a chromosomal abnormality and the zygote will be vulnerable to miscarriage, either during its embryo stage or when it develops into a fetus.', 'A multitude of potential problems stemming from chromosomal abnormalities can affect the embryo or fetus. It can take an unpredictable amount of time for an embryo or fetus to develop enough for it to become clear that, due to its chromosomal makeup, it would be unlikely to survive after birth. It is at this point, usually in the first trimester, that miscarriage will occur.', 'Types of chromosomal abnormalities which commonly lead to miscarriage include:[4]', 'Blighted ovum', 'Blighted ovum is a very common type of miscarriage which occurs early in pregnancy, usually in week 5-6. This is before the developing fetus would be visible on an ultrasound scan.', 'A blighted ovum miscarriage is caused by high levels of chromosome abnormalities in the fetus which would prevent any resultant baby from developing healthily. As a result, the fertilized egg does not develop into an embryo. Instead, a cluster of cells forms in the uterus to make an empty pregnancy sac. A blighted ovum often results in miscarriage before a person is aware that they had become pregnant.', 'Trisomy', 'The fetus will contain one extra chromosome, so 47 chromosomes will be present in total, rather than the usual 46 (23 pairs). The chances of miscarriage in a case of trisomy are high. Trisomies that do not result in miscarriage are usually born with congenital conditions such as Down syndrome.', 'Nullisomy', 'The embryo will be missing a pair of chromosomes. Embryos with missing chromosomes cannot develop healthily and will result in miscarriage.', 'Monosomy', 'A monosomy is a fetus in which one chromosome is missing. The fetus will contain 45 chromosomes: 22 pairs and a half. Monosomies almost always result in miscarriage. If a monosomy comes to term, the baby usually has a congenital condition and/or can only survive outside the womb for a short time.', 'Placental problems', 'Problems with the placenta are frequently found to be the cause of miscarriage or stillbirth, especially early miscarriage. The placenta is an organ which develops in the uterus during pregnancy. It is pancake-shaped and should be positioned at the top of the uterus, as far away as possible from the cervix, i.e. the part connecting the womb to the vagina. After the baby is born, further contractions will typically push the placenta out through the vagina.', 'In its correct position, a healthy placenta performs important functions including:[5]', '\nProviding the developing fetus with oxygen and nutrients\nRemoving waste products from the fetus’ blood through the umbilical cord\nSecreting the hormones necessary to maintain pregnancy\nPassing on antibodies to protect the fetus from infection\n', 'If the placenta does not form or function correctly throughout pregnancy, this is likely to negatively affect the development of the fetus, causing a miscarriage. Ways in which the placenta may cause miscarriage include:[6][7][8]', '\nPassing on toxins from alcohol, excess caffeine, unsuitable environments, medications that are unsuitable for use in pregnancy and illicit substances from the pregnant person to the pregnancy tissue and/or fetus.\nPassing on harmful cells related to infections or inadequately managed long-term health conditions from the pregnant person to the pregnancy tissue and/or fetus.\nPlacental insufficiency, in which the placenta fails to pass sufficient hormones, antibodies, oxygen and nutrients to the developing baby. Placental insufficiency is particularly common when the placenta does not grow big enough to sustain the fetus. For example, this sometimes happens when it is sustaining twins rather than a single fetus.\n', 'Medications which can cause miscarriage', 'People who become pregnant may have an ongoing health condition, or develop a new condition, which requires continual treatment and/or management using certain over-the-counter (OTC) or prescription medications. Before using any medication, pregnant women should always confirm with a doctor that it is safe for use in pregnancy.', 'Physicians can advise on making changes to long-term medications which are needed and/or recommend appropriate new medications to use, to minimise the risks to both mother and baby.', 'In addition to needing medications for possible ongoing conditions and/or new conditions unrelated to the pregnancy itself, pregnancy can cause a person to be affected by certain related conditions such as severe morning sickness or headaches, mainly in the first trimester. These can usually be treated effectively and safely with appropriate OTC or prescription medications as recommended by a doctor.[9]', 'However, particular medications are unsuitable for pregnant women and using them can cause miscarriage or (teratogenic) abnormalities and/or malformations. The reason that certain medications may cause miscarriage is that, like food and drink consumed by the pregnant person, their components are transmitted by the placenta to the developing fetus. Pregnant women are not usually included in safety trials for new compounds, and therefore only a limited amount is known about whether medications are wholly safe for use during pregnancy.', 'To minimize the risk of a medication-induced miscarriage, doctors will:', '\nPrescribe only medications which are widely accepted to be safe for pregnant women and the developing fetus\nAdvise people to avoid medications which have been linked to pregnancy or birth complications and miscarriage\n', 'Medications which are commonly linked to miscarriage include:[10][11]', 'Ibuprofen', 'An over-the-counter or prescription painkiller commonly used to treat fever inflammation and pain, ibuprofen is not recommended for use during pregnancy and can cause congenital defects as well as increase the risk of miscarriage.', 'Read more about Ibuprofen »', 'Isotretinoin', 'Used to treat severe acne, this medication can cause congenital defects, most often affecting the baby’s heart and face, as well as increase the risk of miscarriage.

For example, consuming too much vitamin A can cause congenital defects; supplements containing a maximum of 5,000 IU are recommended. Normal quantities of garlic and fenugreek (as used in cooking) pose no health risks, but larger quantities, found in supplements, may cause miscarriage or preterm birth.', 'Ergotamine and methysergide', 'Used to treat migraine headaches, these medications are associated with an increased risk of premature birth and miscarriage.', 'Read more about Migraine Headache »', 'Natalizumab', 'This medication, which is used to treat multiple sclerosis (MS), may cause miscarriage.

It is believed to vary between different conditions and may affect a person’s pregnancy differently in each case.

Pregnant women should discuss any concerns related to their work or home environment with their doctors and employers, so that adequate precautions against miscarriage can be taken where necessary.', 'Womb or cervical dysfunction', 'Problems with the womb or cervix structure or function can increase the likelihood of miscarrying. Many womb or cervical dysfunctions make miscarriage particularly likely to occur in the second trimester as the developing fetus grows in size. A weakened cervix, known as an impotent cervix, commonly causes miscarriage, as the cervical muscles dilate too early in the pregnancy. This often results in the early expulsion of the fetus from the womb, before it would be able to survive on its own.', 'Good to know: If medical professionals are aware that a pregnant person has a weakened cervix; e.g. because they have previously experienced a miscarriage for this reason, a temporary stitch may be put around the cervix to keep it closed. This procedure is usually performed during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy to prevent miscarriage, and is removed around week 37 in preparation for the birth.[2]', 'Other problems which may affect the pelvic area and cause miscarriage include the presence of non-cancerous growths in the womb (fibroids) and having a uterine form variation (an abnormally-shaped womb). This is normally diagnosed using imaging tests.

This can leave the fetus and placenta vulnerable to attack from the mother’s immune cells.', 'Good to know: The immune system works to protect the body from foreign cells (antigens) by destroying them in order to prevent the development or spread of disease or infection. Both the developing embryo and placenta contain antigens.

['Celiac Disease'],"['Celiac disease is a serious, lifelong condition caused by the immune system reacting to gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye, barley and several other grains. It causes inflammation and damage in the small intestine and can result in a wide range of symptoms throughout the body.[1][2]', 'Symptoms of celiac disease in adults and children may include:[1][3][4]', '\nAbdominal (belly) pain or discomfort\nDiarrhea\nFatty, pale, smelly stools that float in the toilet\nRash\nFatigue\nIrritability and depression\n', 'However, many people have no symptoms or only mild symptoms, which can make a timely diagnosis challenging. Celiac disease often goes unrecognized; only a small fraction of people with the condition are diagnosed.[5][4][2]', 'Celiac disease can affect anyone, of any age, though it tends to be more common among women than men. It occurs in approximately one out of every 100 people. There seem to be two peak periods in the appearance of symptoms - one in the first year of life, between eight and 12 months of age, and the second between approximately 20-40 years of age. Celiac disease is linked to certain genes and is often found to run in families.[1][3][6]', 'In people with celiac disease, eating food that contains gluten causes a severe response from the immune system; it mistakenly damages the lining of the small intestine, leading to difficulty absorbing nutrients and a number of potential complications.[1][4][2]', 'There is currently no cure or way to prevent celiac disease. The only treatment for celiac disease is a lifelong gluten-free diet. Following a strict gluten-free diet allows the lining of the small intestine to heal, clearing up symptoms and reducing the likelihood of developing complications. Any ingestion of gluten will result in damage to the intestine and a relapse of symptoms.[1][3][4][2]', 'Celiac disease symptoms', 'The symptoms of celiac disease can vary widely and range from mild to severe. If present, they are typically persistent.', 'Gastrointestinal (digestive tract) symptoms in adults may include:[5][1][3][4][7]', '\nTransient abdominal (belly) pain\nBloating\nFlatulence or excess wind\nFatty, pale, smelly stools that float in the toilet\nDiarrhea or, rarely, constipation\nPoor appetite\nNausea and vomiting\n', 'Other signs and symptoms of celiac disease in adults may include:[5][1][4][8][7]', '\nFatigue and lethargy\nAnemia\nSevere or persistent mouth ulcers, or canker sores\nDermatitis herpetiformis, a type of rash\nUnintentional weight loss\nLack of menstruation\nInfertility\nRepeated miscarriage\nOsteoporosis\nUnexplained bone or joint pain\nDental enamel problems\nAtaxia, loss of coordination\nPeripheral neuropathy; tingling, numbness or pain in the hands and feet\nHeadaches\nIrritability\nDepression or anxiety\nDementia, in older people\n', 'Many adults with celiac disease do not have any symptoms, or only have mild symptoms.[4] People experiencing symptoms that may be linked to celiac disease can carry out a symptom assessment using the free Ada app now.', 'Causes of celiac disease', 'Celiac disease is caused by a severe response to gluten, a type of protein found in wheat, barley, rye and several other grains. In some people who carry genes called HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8, eating foods containing gluten can trigger the body’s immune system to mistakenly damage the lining of the gut.[1] It is not understood exactly why this happens.[9]', 'Reacting to gluten, the immune system causes inflammation and irritation in the lining of the small intestine. The villi, which are tiny, tube-like projections in the lining and play a key role in the absorption of digested food, become flattened. This is called villous atrophy and can lead to malabsorption, with serious nutritional deficiencies and health complications as a result.[5][1][3][4][2]', 'Risk factors for celiac disease', 'Celiac disease can affect anyone, of any age and racial background. However, certain factors may make a person more likely to develop celiac disease. These include:[1][4][8]', '\nHaving a close relative, e.g. a parent or sibling, with celiac disease; this significantly increases one’s risk\nHaving another autoimmune condition, e.g. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, type 1 diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis\nTurner syndrome, a disorder in which a female only has one out of two X chromosomes\nDown syndrome, also known as trisomy 21\n', 'Celiac disease and “leaky gut”', 'The terms “leaky gut” and “leaky gut syndrome” are often encountered by people looking for information on celiac disease and/or gluten sensitivity. Leaky gut and leaky gut syndrome are not recognized medical terms. They refer to something known as intestinal permeability, which means the ease with which substances are able to move through the mucosal barrier, or wall, of the small intestine.[10][11][12][13]', 'In a healthy intestine, the gaps between cells in the mucosal barrier are usually very small, only allowing appropriately digested nutrients and other substances through to the bloodstream. However, certain substances and conditions can cause the gaps to widen or the intestinal barrier to become “loose” or “leaky”. Celiac disease is one such condition. It is thought that gluten may cause increased intestinal permeability in a number of people without celiac disease, too.[10][11][12][13]', 'There is a theory that increased intestinal permeability might allow potentially harmful substances, e.g. undigested proteins, bacteria and toxins, to pass from the gut into the bloodstream and cause widespread inflammation in the body, with a range of resulting health problems.[10][11][12][13]', 'There is not enough evidence to confirm many of the ideas about leaky gut and the possible effects it may have in the body. Doctors generally recommend eating a balanced, healthy diet for optimal digestive and overall health.[10][11][12]', 'If you have any questions about your digestive health, it is recommended that you consult a medical doctor.', 'Diagnosis of celiac disease', 'After taking the person’s medical history and performing a physical examination, a doctor will typically order blood tests if celiac disease is suspected. If the results suggest that celiac disease is present, a biopsy will then be recommended to confirm the diagnosis.[1][4]', 'Good to know: If you think that you might have celiac disease, it is very important that you do not go gluten-free until you have spoken to a doctor and been tested, if necessary. Adopting a gluten-free diet can interfere with the blood test and biopsy results and may cause a false negative.[1][9]', 'Celiac disease blood test', 'A blood test is used to check for the antibodies, proteins that typically fight infection and which are typical of celiac disease. These include IgA tissue transglutaminase (IgA tTG), endomysial IgA and IgG deamidated gliadin peptide. The levels of these antibodies are usually only high in people with celiac disease.[9] A doctor may also recommend blood tests to check for nutritional deficiencies, e.g. iron deficiency.[1]', 'Celiac disease biopsy', 'If the blood test shows high levels of the antibodies found in celiac disease, a diagnosis will typically need to be confirmed with a biopsy of the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine. This involves a doctor taking a small sample of tissue, typically using an endoscope – a thin tube that is passed down the throat into the stomach and intestine. The sample is examined for signs of the characteristic damage caused by celiac disease.[1][9]', 'Genetic test for celiac disease', 'In some cases, it may be possible to have a test to check for the presence of the genes that are associated with celiac disease. Not having HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 genes means that developing celiac disease is highly unlikely. However, having the genes does not mean that a person will develop celiac disease; the majority of people with a genetic predisposition to celiac disease never develop the condition.[14][15]', 'Celiac disease treatment', 'There is currently no cure for celiac disease – treatment requires adopting a completely gluten-free diet. In addition, certain supplements and vaccinations may be recommended to help prevent complications from celiac disease.[5][1][4]', 'Gluten-free diet', 'The only effective treatment for celiac disease is a diet that is 100 percent free of gluten. Following a strict gluten-free diet typically results in a rapid improvement in symptoms; a person will usually start to feel better within a couple of weeks, and the lining of the small intestine will start to heal.[5][1][3][4][2]', 'A strict gluten-free diet must be followed for life; the consumption of even a very small amount of gluten can cause damage to the small intestine and trigger a relapse of symptoms.[1]', 'Gluten is found in the following grains:[5][1][3][4]', '\nWheat\nRye\nBarley\nSpelt\nEinkorn\nKamut\nTriticale\n', 'Any foods that contain the above, e.g. breads, pastries and many cereals, will therefore also contain gluten, and must be avoided. Sauces, snack foods, ready-made meals, beers and even medicines are among the many products that often contain gluten; labels should always be checked carefully.', 'Gluten is not found in the following unprocessed starches:', '\nRice\nPotatoes\nCorn\n', 'Oats and celiac disease', 'There are differing opinions on whether oats are suitable for people with celiac disease. Oats contain a protein called avenin, which is similar to gluten. For some people with celiac disease, this does not seem to be a problem. However, others find that it causes a relapse of symptoms and/or damage to the small intestine. Furthermore, some brands of oats may be contaminated with gluten from the factories they are processed in. Some celiac disease authorities advise that oats be included in a person’s diet, while others recommend avoiding all oats and oat products. A doctor may be able to advise on what is most appropriate for a particular person’s dietary needs.[16][8][17][18][19]', 'Good to know: It is possible to enjoy a balanced, healthy diet that does not contain any gluten. Fruit, vegetables, dairy, soya, eggs, fish and meat are all gluten-free, and gluten-free breads, snacks and other products are increasingly available. A doctor will be able to offer advice and/or refer a person to a dietician, support groups and information resources.', 'Other measures', 'A doctor may recommend the following measures to help prevent nutritional deficiencies and other complications from celiac disease:[1][20]', '\nTaking a vitamin, calcium or iron supplement, for at least six months after diagnosis\nHaving the seasonal “flu jab”, the yearly influenza vaccination\nHaving other vaccinations, e.g. the Hib vaccine to prevent blood poisoning and pneumonia, and the pneumococcal vaccine[21]\n', 'Complications of celiac disease', 'Maintaining a strictly gluten-free diet is essential to prevent symptoms and lower the likelihood of complications from celiac disease. Eating even a tiny amount of gluten can cause symptoms and increase the risk of developing complications.[1]', 'Complications associated with poorly managed celiac disease include:[5][1][9]', '\nVitamin D deficiency, iron deficiency and other nutrient deficiencies\nOsteoporosis\nSkin problems, e.g. dermatitis herpetiformis\nUlcers in the intestine, known as ulcerative jejunitis\nWeakened functioning of the spleen and possibly the immune system as a result[21]\nOther autoimmune conditions, e.g. type 1 diabetes and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis\nAnxiety and depression\nRarely, lymphoma, a cancer of the intestinal lymph system, and other cancers of the gastrointestinal tract[22]\nInfertility\nIn undiagnosed women having a child, low birth weight, premature birth or miscarriage\nIn children, stunted growth, delayed puberty and dental problems\n', 'Non-responsive celiac disease', 'About one in 10 people with celiac disease will continue to experience symptoms after they have switched to a strict gluten-free diet. This is often caused by hidden sources of gluten in the diet, but may also be the result of:[5][9]', '\nFood intolerances, e.g. lactose, a sugar found in cow’s milk\nFood allergies\nBacterial overgrowth in the small intestine\nIrritable bowel syndrome\nMicroscopic colitis\nA deficiency of pancreatic enzymes\nRefractory celiac disease\n', 'Refractory celiac disease', 'A small number of people with celiac disease may continue to experience gastrointestinal symptoms even on a confirmed gluten-free diet, or experience short-term relief when going gluten-free and then a recurrence of symptoms. This is called refractory celiac disease. The cause is unknown, and the condition requires treatment with immunosuppressive medication, e.g. steroids.[9]', 'Prevention of celiac disease', 'Previously, it was thought, by not introducing gluten into a baby’s diet until they were 4-6 months old, it might be possible to prevent or slow the development of celiac disease. However, recent research shows that the period at which gluten is first introduced does not affect the development of the condition. It is not yet possible to prevent celiac disease in children or adults.[23][24]', 'Nonetheless, early diagnosis and treatment can help to prevent further development of, and complications from, celiac disease. It is recommended that anyone who experiences symptoms, or could be considered to be at risk for the condition, ask a doctor about screening. For people who are diagnosed with celiac disease, following a strict gluten-free diet can help to prevent further damage to the digestive tract and other complications.[24]', 'Celiac disease in children', 'Celiac disease can affect people of any age, including infants and children. If present, symptoms of celiac disease in children are typically persistent.', 'Gastrointestinal (digestive tract) symptoms in children may include:[25][26]', '\nDiarrhea or constipation\nFatty, pale and smelly[1] stools that float in the toilet\nBloating or abdominal (belly) pain\nFlatulence, commonly known as gas\nWeak appetite\nNausea and vomiting[1][4]\n', 'Other signs and symptoms in children may include:[25][26]', '\nFatigue\nAnemia\nUnexplained weight loss or difficulty gaining weight\nDelayed growth and/or puberty\nSevere or persistent mouth ulcers[27], or canker sores\nDermatitis herpetiformis, a type of rash\nDental problems, e.g. discolored teeth or grooves in the teeth\nThinning of the bones\nAnxiety and/or irritability[28]\nSleep disturbances\n', 'Many children with celiac disease do not have any symptoms, or only have mild symptoms.[4]', 'If a child is suspected of having celiac disease, a doctor will typically recommend blood tests before making any dietary changes and, if the result is positive, a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis.', 'Treatment for celiac disease in babies and children is the same for adults and requires a strictly gluten-free diet. While this may be challenging for the family, it is necessary at all times, without exception and must be continued for the rest of the person’s life to avoid complications. Support groups are available to assist families in adjusting to and managing a 100 percent gluten-free lifestyle.', 'Celiac disease FAQs', 'Q: Is celiac disease genetic?\nA: Yes. Celiac disease is said to be genetic, because it typically develops in people who carry genes called HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8. These genes are found in about 30 percent of people. However, not everyone who has these genes will develop celiac disease; only about one in every 30 people will develop the condition. It is triggered by a combination of genes and environmental factors. If a close relative has celiac disease, a person’s likelihood of developing it is higher, and screening may be recommended.[5][2][28]', 'Q: Is there a test for celiac disease?\nA: Yes. There is a blood test that can detect the antibodies – proteins that typically fight infection – found in celiac disease. If the test is positive for these antibodies, diagnosis is typically confirmed with a biopsy, where a small sample of tissue is taken from the small intestine and checked in a laboratory.[1]', 'Q: What is the difference between celiac disease and gluten sensitivity?\nA: Some people who do not have celiac disease may nonetheless experience similar symptoms when eating foods containing gluten, and they may feel better when they exclude gluten from their diet. This is called non-celiac gluten sensitivity, or simply gluten sensitivity.[14]', 'Q: What is the difference between celiac disease and a wheat allergy?\nA: Celiac disease is a severe response to gluten, a type of protein which is found in wheat and many other grains. Eating foods containing gluten causes a long-term autoimmune reaction, where the body is attacked by its own immune system. Symptoms may not appear immediately. A wheat allergy, on the other hand, is an immediate, short-term reaction to proteins found in wheat specifically. Eating foods containing wheat or being exposed to wheat in other ways causes the immune system to try and attack these proteins as if they were invading germs. The immune system does not attack the body. The symptoms of celiac disease and wheat allergy are different.[29][30]', 'Q: Is there a celiac disease vaccine?\nA: Not yet. A vaccine for celiac disease is currently being researched and tested in clinical trials to see whether it works and whether it is safe for people to receive. It is called Nexvax2® and aims to desensitize people with celiac disease to gluten, so that it no longer triggers an autoimmune response.[31][32]', 'Other names for celiac disease', '\nCoeliac disease (UK spelling)\nCeliac sprue\nNon-tropical sprue\nGluten-sensitive enteropathy\nGluten intolerance (however, celiac disease is more serious than the mild sensitivity to gluten experienced by many people)\n', '', '\n\nPatient. “Coeliac Disease.” November 12, 2015.

Doctors are able to effectively treat cervicitis during pregnancy, but it is important that this treatment is received as early as possible.', 'Prevention of cervicitis', 'Using condoms during sexual intercourse can help prevent bacterial and viral infections of the cervix. Condoms, however, cannot guarantee full protection. Avoiding causes of non-infectious cervicitis, such as things which cause allergies, may help prevent some episodes of cervicitis.', 'Complications of cervicitis: pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)', 'If cervicitis is caused by chlamydia or  gonorrhea and it spreads to the uterus or fallopian tubes, this can result in a condition known as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Symptoms of PID include abdominal pain and fever, and can in some cases lead to fertility problems.', 'PID can typically be treated using antibiotics. People experiencing symptoms that may be linked to PID should visit a doctor as soon as possible. The free Ada app can also be used to carry out a symptom assessment.', 'Read more about Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID)', 'Cervicitis FAQs', 'Q: What is the difference between acute cervicitis and chronic cervicitis?\nA: The difference between acute and chronic cervicitis pivots on how long the condition lasts. Acute cervicitis usually has an infectious cause, most typically STIs, and if properly treated will resolve relatively quickly. If not properly treated, it may become chronic, lasting for a longer period of time. Cervicitis caused by an irritant may also be acute, but is more often a chronic problem, especially if the cause – certain condoms or tampons, for example – are not avoided, and the inflammation is not allowed the time to heal properly.[^5]', 'Q: Is it possible to get cervicitis without an STI?\nA: Yes, in some cases, cervicitis is not caused by an STI. Sexually transmitted infections are the most common cause of the condition, but it can also be caused by allergies, injury and vaginal bacteria imbalance (bacterial vaginosis), among other things.', 'Q: Can cervicitis cause infertility?\nA: Yes, in cases, where cervicitis is caused by chlamydia or  gonorrhea and it spreads to the uterus or fallopian tubes via mechanisms not yet fully understood, but probably related to various inflammatory processes in infections with trichomonas, or when pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), a related condition, develops.[9][10] If you are worried about the possibility of cervicitis complications, seeking immediate medical attention is advised.

['Chemotherapy Side-Effects'],"['Chemotherapy – often abbreviated to chemo or CTX – is a cancer treatment that uses anti-cancer drugs to fight the disease. Chemo is very common and is used to treat most types of cancer, both as a cure and as a method of improving the prognosis.', 'Chemotherapy can result in a wide-range of side-effects. Cancer cells are characterized by their tendency to divide rapidly; chemo therefore fights the disease by attacking fast-dividing cells. Unfortunately, healthy cells that divide quickly are also targeted, resulting in adverse side-effects.', 'Although there is no way to prevent chemotherapy side-effects altogether, there are methods of managing them that can lessen their worst symptoms.', 'Some of the more common side-effects of chemotherapy may include:', '\nFatigue\nVomiting and nausea\nHair loss\nAnemia\nLoss of appetite and feeling full after eating only a small amount\nSleeping issues\nSex and fertility issues\nEmotional stress\nBruising and bleeding\nDiarrhea and constipation\nMouth and throat problems\nSkin and nail problems\nMemory loss\n', 'There is a higher risk of chemotherapy side-effects in the elderly. With increasing age, the total body water decreases, leading to a reduced volume of distribution for drugs that dissolve in water. The total body fat increases, changing the body’s distribution of drugs that dissolve in fat.', 'In addition, kidney function may decrease, leading to a decreased clearance of drugs that are excreted by the kidneys. Furthermore, the presence of other conditions, as well as other drugs being taken may, among other factors, all impact on the tolerability of chemotherapy.[1]', 'Common side-effects of chemotherapy', 'Side-effects of chemotherapy differ from person to person, ranging from mild to severe, depending on the type of cancer that is being treated, the chemotherapy drug that is being administered, the length of the course and the general health of the person.[2]', 'It is difficult to predict what side-effects will be experienced. Of those listed below, it is unlikely a person will experience them all.[3]', 'Fatigue from chemotherapy', 'Fatigue – lack of energy – is the most common side-effect of chemotherapy. Those undergoing chemotherapy often feel a whole-body tiredness that is not relieved by sleep, and which may make them unable to carry out everyday tasks or work. Fatigue may continue once the treatment is over; intensive chemotherapy weakens the body, meaning full recovery can take a long time.', 'There are many possible underlying causes of fatigue, some of which have medical treatment options. Where possible, the best way to combat fatigue is to find out and treat the underlying cause. For instance, there are medications available for fatigue caused by anemia.', 'Vomiting and nausea from chemotherapy', 'Vomiting and/or nausea is common to those undergoing chemotherapy. It can be managed with anti-sickness drugs which can be prescribed by a doctor. It should be noted, however, that these drugs can also have their own side-effects.', 'Chemotherapy hair loss', 'Many people find that hair loss is one of the most distressing side effects of chemo treatment. This side-effect is common but won’t affect all people. The head is the most common location for hair loss, though other regions of the body can also be affected. In almost all cases, the hair will grow back once the chemotherapy has been completed.', 'Depending on the type of cancer and type of chemotherapy used, it is sometimes possible to reduce the chances of hair loss by wearing a cold cap during a treatment, designed to cool the scalp, reducing blood flow to the scalp and therefore reducing the amount of medicine that reaches it.', 'Anemia from chemotherapy', 'By lowering the amount of red blood cells in the body, chemotherapy can also result in anemia. Symptoms of anemia can include fatigue, heart palpitations, shortness of breath and paleness of complexion. Treatments for anemia differ according to its severity; a doctor will be able to explain the best options.', 'Loss of appetite and early satiety from chemotherapy', 'People going through chemotherapy often experience a loss of appetite, i.e.  the feeling of not being hungry, and/or early satiety, i.e. the feeling of being full after eating only a small amount. These changes may last the entire drug regimen or may only be experienced immediately after a treatment. Causes of loss of appetite include:', '\nTaste changes\nDry mouth\nMouth sores\n', 'It is recommended that the affected person try to eat what they can, and, if their doctor says it is ok, ensure they drink plenty of fluids. Some medications may be prescribed by a doctor for long-term lack of appetite.', 'Sleeping issues from chemotherapy', 'Problems with sleep, or insomnia, are common during chemotherapy. It may be helpful to think about possible causes, such as certain medications, pain or anxiety. A healthcare provider will be able to offer advice on how to manage sleep issues.', 'Sex and fertility issues from chemotherapy', 'Chemotherapy may lower a person’s libido or sex drive. Chemotherapy can also result in reduced fertility in both men and women. If there are concerns about lasting infertility, options such as IVF and egg/sperm banking can be explored with a doctor.', 'Emotional stress from chemotherapy', 'Chemotherapy can result in a large amount of emotional stress. This stress can take the form of anxiety and may develop into depression. Talking therapies such as counseling and psychotherapy, as well as support groups to share with others in similar circumstances may help with the emotional stress of chemotherapy.', 'Bruising and bleeding from chemotherapy', 'Chemotherapy can often reduce the number of platelet cells in the blood. This can result in severe bleeding when cut, skin that bruises easily, nosebleeds and bleeding gums. Treatments to improve platelet cell count are available. These include corticosteroid drugs and, in severe cases, blood transfusions.', 'Diarrhea or constipation from chemotherapy', 'Diarrhea and/or constipation can be a common side-effect in the early stages of chemotherapy. An affected person can consult a doctor for dietary recommendations to minimize diarrhea or constipation.', 'If the problem persists and a doctor says it is ok, over-the-counter medications may be taken to help minimize this side-effect.', 'Mouth and throat problems from chemotherapy', 'Chemotherapy can result in mouth and throat ulcers or sores, also known as mucositis. These ulcers can be painful and result in difficulty eating and drinking. They can also become easily infected. If necessary, doctors can prescribe painkillers or other appropriate treatments.', 'Skin and nail problems from chemotherapy', 'Dry, itchy, discolored or sore skin can result from chemotherapy. The nails can also become brittle or flaky. Ointments and creams can be prescribed to help.', 'Chemotherapy memory loss', 'For reasons that aren’t completely clear, chemotherapy can also result in short-term memory loss and an inability to concentrate properly. This side-effect usually dissipates once the treatment is complete. Many people manage this by setting reminders, keeping written records and asking for help where necessary.', 'More serious chemotherapy side-effects', 'Some side-effects of chemotherapy are less common but can become serious.', 'Osteoporosis from chemotherapy', 'People undergoing chemotherapy are more at risk of developing osteoporosis, a condition that thins and weakens the bones. Women, particularly those over the age of 50, as well as people with breast cancer, are most at risk of osteoporosis.[4] Getting enough calcium and vitamin D lessens the risk of developing the condition. If osteoporosis does develop after chemotherapy, treatment options are available.', 'Heart problems from chemotherapy', 'In rare cases, heart problems can occur with chemotherapy. The symptoms of this may include a rapid or irregular heartbeat, fatigue, chest pain, coughing, dizziness and breathing problems.[5] In extreme cases, these heart problems may lead to a heart attack. If a person experiences any of these symptoms, it is important they contact their doctor immediately.', 'Eye problems from chemotherapy', 'Anti-cancer drugs used in chemotherapy can, in rare cases, lead to eye problems, including cataracts, conjunctivitis, dry-eye syndrome, glaucoma and photophobia, also known as light sensitivity, i.e. a discomfort or pain in the eyes due to light exposure.[6]', 'Thorough washing of the hands and the avoidance of unnecessary touching of the eyes can reduce the risk of eye problems.', 'Long-term side-effects of chemotherapy', 'The duration of chemotherapy side-effects varies. A majority of chemotherapy side-effects will continue in duration for the length of the chemotherapy and disappear soon after the treatment has finished. However, some can be more long lasting, and others can develop after the chemotherapy has finished.', 'Chemo side-effects after treatment may include:', 'Organ problems', 'The anti-cancer drugs used in chemotherapy can lead to long-term problems in organs such as the heart, lungs, kidneys and bladder.[7] To lessen the chances of developing these problems, doctors will check the person’s medical history before administering the drugs, and avoid uncomplimentary drugs accordingly.', 'Risk of second cancer', 'Some chemotherapy drugs have been linked to causing a second cancer of a different type. It is important to realize that this is very rare, and that doctors will avoid the use of these drugs if at all possible. They will also advise about the risks before going forward with the treatment.[8]', 'Chemotherapy side-effects FAQs', 'Q: Are there any natural remedies for chemotherapy side-effects?\nA: There are a variety of natural remedies that may help with the management of mild chemotherapy side-effects. Always talk to a doctor before beginning to use any chemotherapy side-effect remedies, as some methods could interfere with the treatment itself. Natural chemotherapy side-effect remedies include:[9]', '\nGinger: Research suggests eating or drinking foods containing ginger can act as a natural antiemetic.\nRelaxation: Taking steps to relax can help to reduce stress, something that may contribute to chemotherapy side-effects.\nZinc: Eating foods rich in zinc, such as beef, shellfish and fortified breakfast cereals, may help prevent taste changes, a side-effect of chemotherapy, radiation and some pain medicines.\nGlutamine: Taken in supplement form, glutamine may help to reduce weakness and numbness or pain in the hands and feet, and mouth sores and soreness, though evidence is not conclusive.\nAcupuncture: Many people report that this helps with pain relief, as well as other symptoms such as nausea, dry mouth and anxiety.\n', 'Q: Chemotherapy side-effects: when do they start?\nA: Chemotherapy side-effects can be acute, meaning immediate, or late, meaning they are delayed. Acute side-effects may begin when the treatment is given or very soon after it is finished. However, some people may develop side-effects further into the treatment or after treatment is finished, or may have no side-effects at all.[10]', 'Q: Do chemo side-effects get worse with each treatment?\nA: Some people undergoing chemotherapy report that they feel more fatigue the further along they get in their regimen. Nerve damage can occur with chemotherapy, and this may get worse with each dose. Sometimes, treatment has to be stopped because of this. However, other side-effects, including nausea, constipation and diarrhea, are not typically cumulative with repeated treatment.[11]', 'Q: What is the timeline for chemo side-effects?\nA: Everyone reacts differently to chemotherapy, and some people may have mild or no side-effects at all or only experience one or two symptoms. However, the first symptom following treatment is often nausea, which may last for a few hours after each treatment or may linger for several days, and may continue throughout the drug regimen. Symptoms that may develop slightly later, in the days, weeks and months after beginning treatment, include:[12]', '\nMouth soreness and changes in taste: Often occurs within 5-10 days after starting. Typically goes away gradually in about 3-4 weeks after treatment is finished.\nFatigue: Usually begins after the first week or two of chemotherapy. Normally resolves within six months after treatment.\nLoss of mental acuity: Often occurs within the first few weeks after beginning chemotherapy. May increase, depending on the dosage, type of chemotherapy and general health of the person affected. May last for up to a year or two after treatment is finished.\nHair loss: Usually begins within 2-3 weeks after starting chemotherapy. Tends to start growing back 2-3 months after treatment is finished.\n', '', '\n\nMedscape. ""Breast Cancer in the Elderly.""

Common symptoms include a persistent cough, shortness of breath and fatigue.', 'Most often developing out of respiratory infections such as flu or a common cold, chest colds are caused – in most cases – by the same set of viruses as cause the common cold. In rare cases, a chest cold can also be caused by a bacterial infection.[1]', 'Most people find that a chest cold clears up in two to three weeks, without the need for treatment. In severe cases or when the symptoms do not subside in the normal timeframe, doctors will recommend treatment options.', 'A chest cold is generally considered to be a non-serious condition. However, there is a risk that a chest cold will develop into pneumonia – a more serious condition.

These include:', '\nApple cider vinegar: Raw, unfiltered apple cider vinegar helps thin the mucus in the chest, which can reduce congestion and help a person with a chest cold to breathe better. Drinking a solution of warm water mixed with two teaspoons of apple cider vinegar two or three times a day for a week will help reduce the duration of a chest cold and strengthen the immune system, preventing future colds.\nTurmeric: Tumeric, a plant and spice that grows in Southeast-Asian and Middle-Eastern countries, is very effective at reducing the symptoms of a chest cold. It contains the compound curcumin, which has antiviral, antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. Adding around a teaspoon of raw, grated turmeric or powdered tumeric to a hot drink several times a day or using it to flavour food can help alleviate the symptoms of a chest cold.\nGinger: Ginger has been used as a natural remedy to treat various conditions for over 2000 years and is an effective agent in reducing the inflammation in the chest caused by a chest cold. It can be added to food in its raw state, brewed as a tea or taken as supplements.\nEssential oils: There are many different types of essential oils, each of which are particularly helpful with alleviating the symptoms of a different array of conditions. The most helpful essential oils for treating a chest cold include frankincense, oregano, eucalyptus, tea tree and lemon.

The intensity of their adverse reactions to specific triggers may also increase or decrease.', 'Environmental triggers of asthma in children include:', '\nAirborne irritants (such as pet dander) and pollutants (such as scented cleaning products)\nWeather conditions, especially changes in temperature or humidity\n', 'Physical triggers of asthma in children include:', '\nAllergies\nEmotional extremes such as stress, anger or nervousness\nExercise\nGastroesophageal reflux\nIn infants, feeding\nNegative reactions to pharmaceutical medications such as painkillers\nRespiratory infections such as colds and/or flu\n', 'Skin or food allergies can cause asthma symptoms to occur in some children. This is called allergy-induced asthma or allergic asthma.', 'Allergy-induced asthma', 'Allergy-induced asthma is the most common type of asthma. Allergic asthmatic children are simultaneously affected by allergies and asthma. It is possible to confuse an allergic reaction, such as hay fever, with a flare-up of asthma. It can be difficult to determine whether a child’s symptoms relate to either condition, or to a combination of both. This is further complicated by the fact that it is possible for both reactions to be stimulated by the same trigger.', 'Allergens which commonly trigger allergic asthmatic reactions in children include:', '\nDander from pets\nDust mites\nHouse dust\nPollen\n', 'If a child appears to be affected by asthmatic symptoms, allergic reactions or a combination of the two, it is advisable to visit a health care provider or an allergist, who will be able to help identify the principal triggers, and suggest further stimuli to be avoided.', 'An allergist may also decide to prescribe medications against allergy symptoms, such as antihistamines. These will need to be factored into the child’s overall treatment plan, which will involve measures to manage their asthma. These may include asthma medications, immunology programmes and/or the use of a nebulizer, depending on the severity of the child’s condition and how often they experience a flare-up. (See Treatment for more information.)']","['It is not always possible to identify the cause of asthma in children, and a child may develop the condition with no apparent triggers. The main possible causes of asthma in children are:', '\nGenetic predisposition. Children with a family history of asthma, eczema, hives and/or allergic rhinitis develop asthma more commonly than those without.\nEnvironmental factors. Exposure to air pollutants, including cigarette smoke and potential triggers of asthma, including dust mites, pollen and pet dander, may cause children to develop  asthma.\nInfections. Children may develop asthma as a result of certain types of infections that affect the airways, including viral infections such as the common cold.\n', 'Risk factors', 'Some children are at greater risk of developing asthma than others. Risk factors for developing asthma include:', '\nA family history of asthma and related conditions such as eczema\nA medical history of allergic reactions, including food and pet allergies, skin reactions and hay fever\nLiving in an urban area, where there is greater exposure to pollution\nRegular exposure to potential triggers of asthma such as cigarette smoke and pet dander\nObesity\nOther respiratory conditions, including sinusitis (inflamed sinuses) and/or a chronic blocked nose (rhinitis)\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)\n', 'Before puberty, boys are at greater risk of developing asthma than girls; the biological reasons for this are not yet medically understood.[3]', 'Diagnosis', 'Each child experiences asthma differently, and a child may not exhibit all of the symptoms or respond to all the triggers listed. Within individual children, asthma symptoms and their severity may change. It is usual for the doctor to consider a range of possible causes for the child’s symptoms, in order to eliminate other conditions before offering a definitive diagnosis of asthma.', 'Non-allergic conditions that typically cause asthma-like symptoms include:', '\nAspiration (when pieces of food or other small items accidentally pass into the airway)\nPulmonary Aspergillosis (a fungal infection of the lung)\nRespiratory tract infections such as bronchiolitis and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)\nRhinitis (runny, stuffy nose)\nSinusitis\nVocal cord dysfunction\nAcid reflux or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)\nAirway abnormalities caused by such as an esophageal disorder(where acid from the stomach triggers a reaction that inflames the airways) or neuromuscular respiratory diseases\n', 'Many of these conditions commonly co-occur with asthma. A diagnosis of asthma in a child therefore requires the doctor to determine whether the child’s symptoms are purely asthmatic, caused by a condition other than asthma, or whether the child has developed another condition in addition to asthma.', 'Diagnostic tests', 'A variety of tests are available to help diagnose asthma in children, including lung function tests and allergy skin tests. These tests usually work best for children of five years and older.', 'To diagnose asthma in children of 5 years and older, doctors tend to use the same tests that are used to identify the disease in adults. The main tests used to identify asthma are:', 'Lung function tests', 'Lung function tests (spirometry) are primary tests used to measure how much air the child can exhale and how quickly. They involve using a device called a spirometer, attached to a mouthpiece by a cable. [4] To determine the severity of the asthma diagnosis, the child’s lung function is usually measured during three levels of activity: after taking asthma medication, after exercising and at rest.', 'Lung function tests employ flow volume loops to measure how quickly the child can inhale, and their maximum intake of breath in one inhalation. This helps detect obstruction of air in the neck, such as vocal cord paralysis or dysfunction- which helps to identify any non-asthmatic conditions that may be a correct or additional diagnosis.', 'Allergy skin tests', 'When a child is diagnosed with asthma, and  the doctor suspects that they may be affected by allergic asthma, allergy skin tests may be used in addition to the tests for asthma to test for possible triggers which may be causing the symptoms. The skin is pricked, and solutions containing extracts of common allergy-causing substances are applied, such as animal dander, mold or dust mites. The child is then observed for signs of an allergic reaction.', 'Methacholine challenge test (MCT)', 'The Methacholine challenge test (MCT) is used to diagnose mild or intermittent (occurring at irregular intervals) asthma. If lung function tests do not result in the child’s asthma diagnosis, a doctor may order a methacholine challenge test. During this test, the child inhales increasing amounts of a mist of methacholine before and after spirometry. Methacholine is a drug that stimulates the nervous system and causes wheezing and shortness of breath.', 'Body plethysmography', 'In some cases, a body plethysmography test may be carried out in addition to the diagnostic tests above. In this test, a child will breathe in and out in an instrument called a body box. The body box is airtight, and breathing in and out of it causes changes to the air pressure inside the box.', 'Medical professionals can monitor the air pressure inside the box to add many details to their understanding of how well a child’s respiratory system is performing. This test can be used to measure factors including the volume of air present in the lungs after breathing normally, the specific airway resistance (how much the respiratory tract resists airflow when a person breathes in and out) of the lungs and their total lung capacity.[5]', 'Diagnosing asthma in children under 5 years of age', 'It is often very hard for doctors to provide a conclusive diagnosis of asthma in children under 5 years of age, as their lungs are not sufficiently developed to accurately carry out lung function tests. Many other conditions such as rhinitis, sinusitis, and respiratory tract infections, such as bronchitis, have the same symptoms as asthma.', 'For this reason, doctors often opt to observe a child’s symptoms over a longer period with regular check-ups, until it is possible to provide an asthma diagnosis.', 'Treatment', 'There is no cure for asthma, but asthma can be managed with proper prevention and treatment. Treatment for childhood asthma focuses on minimising exposure to any identified triggers, so as to avoid flare-ups.

The most commonly prescribed ICSs include fluticasone (Flovent Diskus, Flovent HFA), budesonide (Pulmicort Flexhaler), mometasone (Asmanex), ciclesonide (Alvesco) and beclomethasone (Qvar). These medications need to be taken regularly for several days to weeks, adhering to the prescription, before the child feels their full anti-asthmatic effects.', 'Short-acting beta-agonists (SABA)', 'These medications are nebulized medications which provide immediate relief of asthma symptoms.

Chronic (long-term) asthma, or asthma which is not treated effectively over the course of many years, has the potential to damage the lungs on a permanent basis in two main ways: by causing airway fibrosis (scarring) of the tissue in the airways and by causing remodelling (permanent narrowing of the airways).[7]', 'Both of these changes result from the respiratory system being inflamed regularly for long periods. Not everybody has the potential to develop permanent lung damage from the inflammation associated with asthma, but it is important that all children with asthma begin effective treatment as soon as possible to avoid this outcome. The Asthma Center recommends that early and intensive treatment of childhood asthma should be focussed particularly on calming inflammation in order to reduce the risk of long-term lung damage.', 'Q: Can childhood asthma cause chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?\nA: Not usually, especially if asthma in children is treated promptly and effectively. The primary causes of COPD – a type of obstructive lung disease associated with long term breathing problems and poor air flow which usually develops in adulthood – are smoking tobacco and exposure to poor quality air, for example, living in an area with high pollution.', 'However, COPD can also be caused by genetic factors and people, who are affected by asthma or who have been affected as children, are believed to be at greater risk than the general population of developing the condition.[8] Recent research indicates that persistent (long term, severe or ineffectively treated) childhood asthma can lead to reduced lung growth and function in adulthood, an outcome which is found to increase the possibility of developing COPD.[9]', 'Q: Can childhood asthma come back during pregnancy?\nA: Many children appear to “outgrow” childhood asthma. However, there is no cure for asthma and there is always the possibility that a child may encounter new triggers and re-experience the symptoms as an adult. Pregnancy may place unfamiliar stresses on the body, which could trigger asthmatic symptoms.[10] Feeling unwell?

This is where the protective mucus layer in the stomach is damaged, leading to loss of gastric glandular cells, which is compensated by cells usually found in the intestine. Eventually, gastric glandular cells are replaced by intestinal and fibrous tissue. This process is known as intestinal metaplasia (IM) of the stomach, and those affected are at increased risk of gastric cancer compared to the general population, although this is still a low risk overall.[3][4][6][15]', 'Atrophic gastritis on its own does not tend to cause symptoms. It is often diagnosed during an internal examination of the stomach after a person exhibits other signs of gastritis, such as:[3]', '\nStomach pain\nNausea and vomiting\nBloating\n', 'Stomach ulcers', 'A stomach ulcer is a sore in the lining of the stomach, caused by damage to the stomach lining due to prolonged exposure to gastric acid.

H. pylori is usually acquired in childhood, though symptoms do not develop until later in life.', 'Another cause of damage to the mucus layer is the repeated use of NSAID drugs, such as aspirin, and excessive consumption of alcohol. These substances can irritate the mucus lining of the stomach. A small number of cases of chronic gastritis are caused by an autoimmune reaction.[23][24]', 'Causes of autoimmune chronic gastritis', 'An autoimmune reaction can also cause chronic gastritis. The body’s autoimmune response causes an inflammation of the protective mucus lining of the stomach, which eventually atrophies the mucus-producing cells. This leads to fewer mucus-producing cells being available and, consequently, less protection for the stomach. This is accompanied by a loss of parietal cells in the stomach, which regulate stomach acid. Parietal cells also affect absorption of vitamin B12 and iron by the stomach, so their loss may cause malabsorption.[8]', 'It is not known what causes the autoimmune reaction, but people with autoimmune chronic gastritis often have other autoimmune conditions such as autoimmune thyroiditis, Addison’s disease or type I diabetes.[8][14]', 'Risk factors', 'Certain population groups, and people who overuse certain substances are at increased risk of chronic gastritis:', '\nHabitual use of painkillers like aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen can change the composition of the stomach lining, leaving it less protected and causing both acute and chronic gastritis.\nExcessive alcohol consumption is another common risk factor.[25]\nInfection with H. pylori (type B)  is more common among older people. Incidences of H. pylori infection have been falling in the developed world since the 1960s, likely due to better hygiene practices.[26][27]\n', 'Diagnosis', 'To assist with the diagnosis of chronic gastritis, a doctor will take the person’s medical history, including their use of medications such as aspirin, NSAIDs and antacids, as well as alcohol consumption and travel to countries where H. pylori is endemic.

['Chronic Heart Failure'],"['Chronic heart failure, otherwise known as congestive heart failure or heart failure, is an ongoing inability of the heart to pump enough blood through the body to ensure a sufficient supply of oxygen. The causes of the condition vary, but some of the most common risk factors include old age, diabetes, high blood pressure and being overweight. Chronic heart failure is most common in men.', 'The condition’s name is potentially confusing; the term “heart failure” does not mean that the heart has stopped or is failing completely, but that it is weaker than is normal in a healthy person. In some cases, the condition can be mild, causing symptoms that may only be noticeable when exercising, in others, the condition may be more severe, causing symptoms that may be life-threatening, even while at rest.[1]', 'The most common symptoms of chronic heart failure include shortness of breath, tiredness, swelling of the legs and ankles, chest pain and a cough. It most commonly affects older people and people with other heart conditions and is typically treated with a combination of lifestyle and diet changes, and medications. Chronic heart failure is typically a long-term condition that gradually worsens over time. This is the feature that differentiates it from acute heart failure, which develops very suddenly. It cannot typically be cured, but symptoms can be managed effectively.', 'Types of chronic heart failure', 'The condition affects the lower chambers of the heart, known as the right and left ventricles. The left ventricle pumps blood around the body, supplying it with oxygen. Chronic heart failure occurs when the heart cannot adapt to the body’s changing need for oxygen, for example when exercising or climbing the stairs.[1]', 'There are different types of chronic heart failure, classified according to how the heart reacts when it pumps. The two main types are:[1][2]', '\nHeart failure with reduced ejection fraction: Also called systolic heart failure or HFrEF, this type occurs when the heart is too weak and doesn’t squeeze normally.\nHeart failure with preserved ejection fraction: Also called diastolic heart failure or HFpEF, this type occurs when the heart is too stiff and doesn’t fill with blood normally.\n', 'It is also possible to be affected by a combination of these two types. Moreover, each type of chronic heart failure can affect the left ventricle, right ventricle or both simultaneously.']","['The symptoms of chronic heart failure generally depend on the type of the condition being experienced and its location, i.e. which ventricle is involved.[2]', 'The main symptom of left-sided chronic heart failure is shortness of breath, which will generally become worse with activity or when lying flat.

['Chronic Idiopathic Constipation'],"['Chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) is an ongoing condition without any known cause or identified underlying illness. Constipation is a condition which can be defined as a state of unsatisfactory defecation, with characteristic features of infrequent stools and difficulty in passing stools, or both.[1] Eight million people in the US seek medical care for constipation every year, and one million are hospitalized.[2] It is likely that many people who have CIC do not report the condition to their doctors because they are embarrassed or do not see it as a major problem requiring medical care.', 'CIC and Irritable Bowel Syndrome both present as chronic constipation,[2] and are distinct from acute constipation. Acute constipation usually has an organic cause, such as medication or a medical condition, while chronic constipation usually does not, although medication can sometimes play a role.[3] The term idiopathic means that the disorder arises spontaneously, without any known cause. Chronic idiopathic constipation, therefore, is a type of chronic constipation that has no obvious cause. It is a form of functional constipation.', 'CIC is characterized by infrequent stools which are often difficult to pass. It typically affects women and older adults. The typical symptom of this condition is passing fewer than 3 bowel movements per week for more than 6 months.', 'To diagnose CIC, a physician usually excludes all other causes of constipation.. The treatment options are limited but include dietary changes and physical exercise.']","['Infrequent bowel movements and difficulty passing stool, are the most common symptoms. If you experience any of the symptoms listed below more than 25% of the time for six months or more, you may need to be assessed for CIC:[1][2][4]', '\nStraining\nHard stools\nA feeling of incomplete evacuation, i.e. a sensation of stool remaining in the bowel after defecating\nA feeling of blockage in the anus or rectum\nUse of manual maneuvers; using the hands; to facilitate defecation\n', 'In addition, a major symptom is having fewer than three bowel movements a week.', 'Good to know: Irritable Bowel Syndrome shares some symptoms with chronic idiopathic constipation, but people with IBS report pain and bloating more often than people with CIC, and report that their symptoms improve after defecation. This is not the case with CIC. People with CIC almost never experience diarrhea without using laxatives.[1] They also experience normal loose stools only rarely. For more information on Irritable Bowel Syndrome, see this resource', 'There are several gastroenterological symptoms which indicate that chronic constipation may have a serious medical condition as its underlying cause, rather than being idiopathic. These include:[2][3][4]', '\nDistended abdomen/severe bloating\nVomiting\nBlood in the stool\nHematochezia[5]\nUnintended weight loss\nAnemia\nSevere constipation of recent onset\nRapid worsening of constipation\nFamily history of colon or rectal cancer\n', 'These symptoms are more likely to indicate a serious underlying condition in people who are over 50 years of age at the time of symptoms first appearing.', ""Good to know: Constipation is a possible symptom of colorectal cancer, a common gastroenterological cancer that usually affects people who are older than 60 years of age. It is associated with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. For more information on colorectal cancer, see this resource.""]","['CIC is most commonly seen in women and older adults. The causes of chronic idiopathic constipation are largely unknown. However, possible causes include a reduction in fluid and fiber intake in the diet, changes in water balance, and changes in contractility of the colon.', 'There are several different forms of CIC, including chronic idiopathic constipation:[4]', '\nNormal transit constipation, where the stool may be harder than normal and therefore more difficult to pass, but moves through the colon at a normal speed\nSlow transit constipation, where stools move through the colon more slowly than usual\nDisorders of defecation or evacuation\n', 'Disorders of defecation or evacuation include:[1][4]', '\nRectocele, a condition where the wall of the rectum bulges into the wall of the vagina inside the body and forms a pouch\nRectal prolapse, a condition where the rectum protrudes through the anus and becomes visible outside the body\nDyssynergic dysfunction\n', 'Dyssynergic dysfunction arises from problematic co-ordination of the various muscles and sphincters that control defecation. Defecation requires the muscles involved to coordinate the creation  of increasing pressure inside the rectum, followed by relaxation of the internal and external anal sphincters and relaxation of the perineal muscles.[1] This requires the coordination of the pelvic floor muscles, abdominal muscles, and the muscles in the rectum.[4]', 'If these structures do not work together, defecation becomes difficult. People experiencing dyssynergic dysfunction often report a feeling of obstruction and incomplete evacuation. Complications of dyssynergic dysfunction include rectocele, anal fissure and rectal prolapse.', 'In some cases, chronic constipation may be caused by certain medications, such as:[3]', '\nAntihistamines\nAntipsychotic medications\nAntispasmodic medications\nOpioids\nGeneral anesthetics\nAntiparkinsonian drugs\n', 'Good to know: Medication-related constipation may be chronic (long-lasting) or acute (short-term), and may improve if use of the medication that is causing it is stopped.']","['As it is not possible to determine the cause of CIC, the treatment options tend to be limited. Dietary changes, like increasing dietary fiber and water intake are usually helpful, as is doing regular physical exercise. However, diet, fluid intake and exercise are not uniformly effective, and some people with CIC may be recommended to use:[1][2]', '\nFibre supplements such as psyllium, calcium polycarbophil, inulin and maltodextrin\nOsmotic laxatives such as polyethylene glycol or lactulose\nStimulant laxatives such as bisacodyl, glycerol or sodium picosulfate\n', 'Laxatives can help with softening stool and improving regularity of bowel movements. Fibre supplements have a similar effect.', 'People who do not find that laxatives provide enough relief from the symptoms of CIC, or for whom laxatives are not recommended, may find serotonin agonists, such as prucalopride or velusetrag, useful.', 'However, the main medications that are recommended when laxatives do not work or cannot be used are lubiprostone (a fatty acid) and linaclotide (an oligo-peptide agonist).[1] These medications work by increasing the amount of chloride that is secreted into the gut, which increases the amount of fluid in the gut, which in turn stimulates bowel movements.[2] One side effect of linaclotide is diarrhea. Otherwise, both drugs are very effective for CIC.', 'People with CIC resulting from dyssynergic dysfunction may find biofeedback useful. (see FAQs). If done by a trained therapist, biofeedback can be used to correct incorrect defecatory technique and in that way “retrain” the pelvic floor.[1]', 'Probiotics, which replenish or balance the growth of healthy intestinal bacteria, may be helpful for some people.', 'Other names for chronic idiopathic constipation', '\nChronic constipation\nConstipation\nFunctional constipation\n', 'Chronic idiopathic constipation FAQs', 'Q: How should CIC be treated in children? \nA: Young children may not be able to describe the symptoms of chronic idiopathic constipation to their caregivers, so it is important to be vigilant for signs of abdominal distress or discomfort in children, especially surrounding bowel movements. Treating constipation in children promptly can prevent it from becoming chronic. Frequent soiling is a symptom of CIC which is specific to children.[6] Children may experience feelings of shame and therefore not report discomfort to their caregivers. In addition, the feelings of discomfort and difficulty during bowel movements may mean that children begin to resist going to the bathroom or withhold stool.[7]', 'CIC in children can arise due to a number of different factors, such as a low-fiber diet and or taking certain medications, that may interact with one another.[8] While the condition cannot be cured, it can be treated. Treatment options include laxatives and enemas, as well as a special individualized diet. Children with CIC may be treated by teams of specialists including gastroenterologists, colorectal surgeons and urologists.[9]', 'Q: Do people with CIC need to be hospitalized??\nA: People with CIC do not need to be hospitalized in most cases. Treatment procedures such as management of fecal impaction, use of laxatives, the administration of enemas, biofeedback therapy, and the manual management of minor rectal prolapse can all be done as outpatient procedures or at home.[10]', 'However, complications that may arise from CIC, such as moderate or severe rectal prolapse and rectocele may need surgical treatment, and this will involve hospitalization.[11][12] In very rare cases, people with chronic idiopathic constipation related to obstruction or slow transit may need surgery to remove a portion of the sigmoid colon.[13][14]', 'Q: Are there any home remedies that can help manage chronic idiopathic constipation?\nA: Taking steps to manage chronic idiopathic constipation at home is possible, and home management often accompanies medical treatment.', 'Weight management, plentiful fluid intake and regular exercise are important in preventing severe constipation. Eating a diet high in fibre is also helpful in most cases. Although it is anecdotally believed that hot coffee beverages can stimulate bowel movements, this has not been conclusively scientifically established.[15]', 'Some people with CIC may find following a low FODMAP diet helpful, as it can reduce bloating, flatulence and cramps, as well as diarrhea or constipation. FODMAP stands for “Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides, and Polyols”, short-chain carbohydrates which are poorly absorbed by the body.', 'It should be noted that a low FODMAP diet is generally considered to be more useful in cases of IBS than CIC.[16] Because FODMAP can become complicated, people who are considering it as a method of managing CIC or IBS should consult a dietitian first.', 'Q: What is biofeedback?\nA: Biofeedback is a method by which people can learn to control bodily processes that were previously believed to be involuntary or out of their control. Biofeedback can be used to treat symptoms, as well as boost overall wellness. It should be noted that, although it is non-invasive, painless, and usually free of side effects,[17] biofeedback needs to be done by a qualified therapist and requires input and effort from the person receiving biofeedback as treatment.[18]', 'In people affected by constipation, biofeedback is concentrated on learning to voluntarily relax the muscles that govern the opening and closing of the anal sphincter muscles.[17] The process uses a computer, special sensors that are placed inside the body, and verbal reinforcement and encouragement from the therapist. It is usually completely painless.', 'In biofeedback, sensors measure electrical currents produced by the activity of muscles in the affected areas. These currents are displayed as information on a computer monitor. Being able to see muscle movement in an easily-understandable form like this helps the affected person to visualise what is happening inside their body.[19] In this way, they can learn what is happening and how to control it.', '', ""\n\nAmerican College of Gastroenterology. “American College of Gastroenterology Monograph on\nthe Management of Irritable Bowel Syndrome and\nChronic Idiopathic Constipation”. 1 August 2014.

Bacterial infections rarely cause chronic laryngitis.']","['Treatment for long-lasting laryngitis depends on the source of the issue. If the laryngitis is caused by gastric reflux, that underlying condition should be treated. If the inflammation is caused by a bacterial infection, antibiotic medications are normally taken.', 'Aside from addressing the root cause with appropriate medications and/or therapies, treatment for persistent laryngitis mainly involves resting the voice and soothing the throat, to give the larynx and vocal cords a chance to heal. Self-care remedies that may be helpful include:', '\nGiving up tobacco products, especially smoking, which can dry out the throat and vocal cords.\nChoosing non-caffeinated, non-alcoholic beverages, which can dehydrate the body, aggravating laryngeal symptoms.\nDrinking plenty of water, to thin mucus in the throat, so that it clears easily. This decreases congestion and helps minimise the need to cough.\nUsing natural products that fight infection like ginger and turmeric extracts. These can be added to hot drinks, can reduce the need to cough and help fight infection.\nKeeping clean by using antibacterial handwashes and wipes at regular intervals throughout the day, particularly after coughing.

['Chronic Renal Failure'],"[""Chronic renal failure is a condition involving a decrease in the kidneys' ability to filter waste and fluid from the blood. It is chronic, meaning that the condition develops over a long period of time and is not reversible. The condition is also commonly known as chronic kidney disease (CKD)."", 'Chronic renal failure is typically caused by certain other medical conditions that put strain on  the kidneys over time, including diabetes, high blood pressure or hypertension and long-term inflammation of the kidneys. Early symptoms of reduced kidney function include urinating more frequently, high blood pressure and swelling of the legs.', 'Around 15 percent of adults, or 30 million people in the United States are thought to have kidney disease at some stage. Because the condition takes some time to develop, it most commonly affects older people. Women are affected slightly more often than men, and people of African, Latin American and Native American descent are at higher risk of CKD.[1]', 'People who are at risk of chronic renal failure should have regular health checks, which include evaluating the glomerular filtration rate. This is a more reliable method of diagnosing early stages of chronic renal failure than waiting for symptoms to appear.', 'Treatment consists of managing the underlying condition and supporting kidney function. Chronic renal failure requires careful, lifelong management, and can progress to end-stage kidney failure which requires dialysis or transplant. However, many cases of chronic renal failure are mild to moderate and can be managed by patients with support from a doctor.[2]']","['In the early stages of chronic renal failure, affected people often do not experience any symptoms. However, symptoms that may emerge during the early stages of chronic renal failure include:[3][4]', '\nThe urge to urinate more frequently\nUrine may be pale and foamy\nHypertension, also known as high blood pressure\nSwelling of the legs\nPoor appetite\nWeight loss\n', 'As the condition progresses, affected people may develop other symptoms such as:[3][4][5][6]', '\nMuscle cramps or twitches\nDeveloping brown spots on the skin\nWorsening of swelling, including on the hands, ankles, feet and around the eyes\nDrowsiness or lack of concentration\nFeeling lethargic and without energy\nBruising easily\nBlood in the stool\nAmenorrhea (periods stopping)\nItchy, dry skin\nPain in the bones\nIncreased susceptibility to infection\nNausea and vomiting\n', 'Concerned that you may have a kidney problem?

One in three adults with diabetes are likely to develop chronic renal failure\nHypertension. One in five adults with high blood pressure are likely to develop chronic renal failure\n', 'People with diabetes and hypertension, who are at high risk of developing chronic renal failure, should have regular health checks to measure their glomerular filtration rate.

Everyone with end-stage renal failure should be evaluated for a kidney transplant.[5]', 'Good to know: Some over-the-counter medications, including vitamins and herbal supplements, can worsen chronic renal failure. It may be helpful to review medications with a doctor and replace or stop any medications which can damage the kidneys.[3]']"
['Cluster Headaches (CHs)'],"['Cluster headaches (CHs) are a relatively uncommon headache disorder. This kind of headache affects people in bouts (clusters), over periods of weeks or months. According to the World Health Organization, CHs affect around one in a thousand people. They primarily affect adults, and the first episodes usually begin to appear during a person’s 20s or thereafter.', 'The most notable characteristic of CHs is the unprecedented intensity of the pain which those affected experience during a headache attack. Cluster headaches are described as one of the most painful types of headache. The exact causes of cluster headaches are unknown, but they are six times more likely to affect men than women.[1] Currently identified possible triggers include stress, exposure to allergens and heavy alcohol use.', 'An affected person may experience bouts (clusters) of 1-8 headaches per day, also known as cluster periods, for intermittent periods of time lasting weeks or months, usually followed by remission periods when the headaches stop. During remission, no headaches occur for months and sometimes even years. The cycles might be in step with the changing of the seasons. However, some chronic,year-round, presentations of the condition do not seem to have any connections to seasonal or environmental triggers.[2]', 'Although CHs are incredibly painful, they are not life-threatening, and treatment can reduce the frequency and severity of the headaches. In the short-term, treatment for cluster headaches focuses on lessening the symptoms of the headache attack. This usually involves specialized painkillers and/or oxygen therapy, i.e.inhaling pure oxygen through a face mask. Long-term treatment of CHs focuses on lifestyle changes and prevention.']","['CHs are a subtype of headache called a trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia (TAC). Headaches of this kind are unilateral, meaning that they affect one side of the head and face:[3]', '\nCephalalgia is the medical term for a dull, persistent, and usually moderately intense, pain in the head region.\nTrigeminal refers to the trigeminal nerve, responsible for sensation in the face and motor functions such as biting and chewing. Correspondingly, the area affected by CHs is the facial area and the eye area in particular. CHs can affect either the left or the right side of the head, but most people find that they are usually affected on the same side each time.\nAutonomic refers to the fact that the boyd performs the symptoms of CHs automatically, e.g. a runny nose and teary eyes.\n', 'Cluster headaches are associated with pain which develops very suddenly and is incredibly intense. It has been described as an unbearable, piercing, burning and excruciating sensation.[2]', 'The intensity of the pain may cause people to move in an agitated manner during a CH attack. It is common for people to pace up and down during a headache attack, and some people even report making desperate attempts to bang their heads on walls and objects in response to the intensity of the pain.', 'In addition to its characteristic pain, one or more the following symptoms may be present during a CH:[2][4]', '\nA reddened, teary eye\nShrinking of the pupil in the eye\nA drooping or swollen eyelid\nA blocked and/or stuffy nostril\n', 'When they occur, these symptoms will be located on the side of the head affected.', 'Other symptoms of CHs which may be present during an attack include:', '\nA sweaty face and forehead\nA pale or flushed face\nRestlessness (pacing and agitated movement)\nSpreading of the pain to the face, head, neck and shoulders\nA need to avoid light and sound\n', 'Many people only experience one or two of these symptoms in addition to the painful sensation, and it is possible for a person’s symptoms to vary between attacks. However, most people’s symptoms only vary very slightly from one headache attack to another.[5]', 'Good to know: A cluster headache is also known as a migrainous neuralgia, but is a different kind of headache from a migraine. Migraines are often confused with cluster headaches due to the fact that they can also be very painful and can affect people frequently or in bouts for periods of time, so it is important to be aware of their different characteristics to ensure that a person affected by headaches receives treatment for the appropriate type.

If you think that you or a loved one may be affected by CHs, migraine headaches, or another condition, you can get a free symptom assessment by downloading the Ada app.', 'Read more about Migraine Headache »', 'Duration and frequency', 'The natural duration of a cluster headache is usually approximately between 15 minutes and three hours, if there is no specialized treatment to reduce its pain and duration. CHs usually occur one to eight times per day, at the same time or times. It is most common for CHs to occur at night, one to two hours after falling asleep, waking up the affected person.[6]', 'After the headache, the pain usually alleviates very suddenly, leaving the affected person pain-free, and, usually, physically tired.', 'Episodic cluster headaches', 'In people with episodic cluster headaches, CHs will occur every day for periods of weeks or months; six to twelve weeks is normal. This is the case in around 80 percent of people affected by CHs.[7]', 'The rest of the time, a person affected by episodic CHs will experience periods of remission with no CHs. These periods of remission may last months or even years before the next cycle of headaches occurs. Periods in which CHs occur, will usually happen at the same time or times each year. Many affected people experience CHs during Spring and Fall.', 'Chronic cluster headaches', 'For 20 percent of people affected by CHs, the condition is chronic, meaning that the headaches occur all year round rather than in periodic or seasonal cycles. CHs are considered chronic if a bout of CHs lasts for more than a year and/or if periods of remission typically last for less than one month.[7]']","['Only a small amount of information about the physiological mechanism that leads to cluster headaches is known.', 'CHs are linked to increased activity in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus, which contains a control centre for many of the functions of the autonomic nervous system. A greater intensity in the activity of the hypothalamus during CH attacks has been detected by brain imaging studies on people affected by CHs.[8] However, the exact relationship between CHs and the activity of the hypothalamus is not yet understood.', 'They are also been linked to a person having elevated levels of histamine, a chemical produced as part of the body’s immune response to allergens. According to historical research into cluster headaches, people affected by CHs are likely to develop a headache attack when histamine is medically administered.[9]', 'A person’s food intake may contain histamine-rich foods, which can cause CHs. Histamine levels in foods vary, depending on how processed, ripe or matured they are. Foods which are rich in histamine and may cause CHs include: salty foods such as crisps and cured meats, alcohol, vinegar, cocoa and chocolate, shellfish, beans and pulses, and matured cheeses. Keeping a food diary may help to identify foods which are causing CH bouts or attacks.', 'Furthermore, having elevated levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter, has also been linked to CHs. Serotonin is mainly produced in the brain, and is found in the nervous system and gut. It promotes feelings of well-being.', 'However, the relationships between having elevated levels of histamine and/or serotonin and the development of CHs are also unknown.', 'Good to know: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) ‒ medications which are used to treat a variety of mental health conditions including depression and anxiety  ‒ are not believed to cause cluster headaches, despite the fact that they increase the level of serotonin in the brain. This is primarily because they are prescribed to raise serotonin levels which are believed to be low.', 'However, it is important that people who are using SSRIs inform their doctor when seeking treatment for CHs: SSRIs have cross-reactivity with certain medications used to treat CHs. For example, the first-line treatment for CHs, sumatriptan, from the triptan class of medications, works by stimulating serotonin receptors in the brain. The stimulation of the serotonin receptors resulting from the use of triptans has an effect called negative feedback regulation on the brain’s 5-HT synthesis. This effect leads to a larger than normal amount of serotonin being available for use by the brain.', 'Due to this effect, triptans may cause serotonin syndrome when used in conjunction with SSRIs. Serotonin syndrome is a condition involving high body temperature, sweating and tremors, occurring as a result of too much serotonin in the body.', 'Triggers', 'In people who are affected by cluster headaches, certain triggers have been identified which may bring on a bout of cluster headaches. These factors have also been found to trigger headache attacks during a period when a person is experiencing a bout of CHs.', 'Known triggers of CHs, in people already affected by the condition, include:[4][10][11]', '\nSeasonal changes - CHs are believed to be linked to circadian rhythmicity and are therefore likely to occur as the body adjusts to taking in more or less light during the day: a property of the shoulder seasons rather than the extreme ones.\nWeather changes\nExertion\nDrinking alcohol\nSmoking tobacco\nStress\nExposure to allergens, such as pollen and pet dander\nStrong smells, such as paint, petrol or perfume\nTemperature changes - hot towels, hot showers\nHigh altitudes - air travel, trekking\nNitroglycerin, a chemical compound which is used in some medications for chest pain\nFoods high in nitrates, e.g. preserved meats\nElevated levels of histamine\nElevated levels of serotonin\nCocaine\n', 'Risk factors for developing cluster headaches', 'The exact cause of cluster headaches is unknown, but certain factors render a person at increased risk of developing cluster headaches. These include:[10]', '\nBeing male\nUsing tobacco products; however, quitting using tobacco products is not known to affect a person’s chances of developing the condition\nDrinking alcohol\nBeing older than 20\nPrevious trauma or surgery to the head\nA family history of cluster headaches\n', 'Research investigating CHs in various population groups has reliably identified that a small proportion ‒ up to 20 percent ‒ of participants have relatives who are also affected. A significant proportion of people who develop cluster headaches use tobacco products and/or consume alcohol heavily.[10] If you think that you or a loved one may be experiencing cluster headaches, you can get a free symptom assessment at any time by downloading the Ada app.', 'Diagnosis', 'Anybody who thinks they may have experienced a cluster headache should seek medical attention without waiting for a repeat occurrence. To reduce the potential severity and overall impact of CHs on a person’s quality of life, it is important to diagnose and begin treating the condition as soon as possible.', 'There are no specialized diagnostic tests to establish whether a person is affected by cluster headaches. To diagnose CHs, a doctor will assess the following criteria:', 'Brain function. In order to rule out any neurological problems, such as brain or vessel abnormalities, which may be the cause of the headache(s), a brain scan will be performed. If any previously-unknown abnormalities are revealed, these will be considered to be the cause of the headaches, and a diagnosis of CHs will not be given at this time. Instead, the abnormalities will be investigated further and treated.', 'In otherwise-healthy people affected by CHs, the brain scan will be normal with no abnormalities. Doctors can then be confident that the CH attacks are caused by CH disorder rather than any impairment of brain function.', 'Doctors will also assess a person’s medical history with a focus on whether the person’s symptoms could relate to any other headache disorders, and find out whether a person has a family history of cluster headaches. Although the link between genetics and CHs is not understood, people with relatives affected by CHs are more likely to develop the condition.', 'Finally, doctors will find out whether a person’s experience of their headache(s) matches the diagnostic criteria for a cluster headache, which include:', '\nHaving at least one symptom which is ipsilateral (on the same side of the head as the pain) in the eye, nose or face\nRestlessness or agitation\nA duration of 15 minutes to three hours without effective response to medication or painkillers\nA frequency of between one attack every other day or eight attacks per day and an incredibly severe pain\n', 'Avoiding misdiagnosis', 'Doctors will be aware that a person may be affected by other primary headache disorders, which may result in them experiencing headaches that are similar to cluster headaches. These include:[3][12][13]', '\nTrigeminal neuralgia. A chronic pain disorder affecting the same nerve that is involved in cluster headaches.\nMigraine. Some headache attacks can feature autonomic features such as teary eyes. Migraines can also often occur in bouts, which leads to the widespread misconception that a person is experiencing cluster headaches, when they are in fact experiencing clusters of migraines.\nHemicrania continua. A chronic, persistent headache that usually occurs on the same side of the face and head, usually consisting of a constant dull pain which intermittently becomes piercing.\nShort-lasting, unilateral, neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT). Like CHs, SUNCT headaches are a subtype of trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia headaches, but their duration is much shorter than cluster headaches.\n', 'Treatment', 'People who have been diagnosed with CHs are usually treated by a type of doctors specialising in brain and nerve conditions called a neurologist. Those affected by CHs will require both short and long-term treatment in order to manage their headache disorder:', '\nShort-term treatment for CHs focuses on relieving headache attacks themselves by reducing their pain and duration\nLong-term treatment of CHs aims to reduce the frequency of headache attacks and to prolong the periods of remission between bouts. With effective treatment, a person affected by chronic CHs may be able to reduce the frequency of their headaches to the point at which their CH disorder becomes episodic.\n', 'Short-term treatment: managing a cluster headache attack', 'After having diagnosed CHs, doctors will discuss a range of treatments which a person can use during a headache attack in order to relieve their pain. The pain associated with a CH is so severe that it cannot be alleviated with traditional over-the-counter (OTC) painkillers.', 'Specialized treatments for CHs can usually relieve headache pain in 15-30 minutes. These treatments are called abortive agents because they begin to relieve (abort) pain more quickly than OTC painkillers, which are designed to be swallowed. They can be administered by vaporisation, i.e. breathing them in through the nose, or by injection into a muscle, or vein.[14]', 'The principal abortive agents used to relieve the symptoms of a CH attack are oxygen therapy and sumatriptan injections.', 'Oxygen therapy', 'This treatment involves breathing in pure oxygen through a mask at the start of a CH attack. Masks and containers of pure oxygen will be provided by a person’s doctor, and they will be shown how to use the equipment so that they can carry out this treatment themselves, independently, whenever a CH strikes.', 'The rate at which the oxygen is dispensed from the container can be adjusted, and people are usually recommended to breathe in oxygen at a rate of around 15 litres per minute at the start of the attack, which they can decrease to a rate of six to eight litres per minute when the symptoms subside. It is important to continue breathing in the oxygen for five to ten minutes after the attack has finished, otherwise it may return.', 'Sumatriptan (triptan class medication) injections', 'Sumatriptan is a medication which is used in the treatment of migraines and cluster headaches. It works by narrowing the blood vessels in the brain, which stops the transmission of pain signals. Sumatriptan works best as an abortive agent when injected into the skin and can be injected into the outside of the thigh or upper arm. Never inject sumatriptan into a vein or muscle.[15]', 'A person’s doctor will demonstrate how to inject sumatriptan, and these injections are then safe to use independently, ideally at the first sign of a CH attack. Sumatriptan is most effective when used at the start of a CH attack. Doctors will recommend the appropriate dose and dosing schedule in each case.[16]', 'It is also possible to use sumatriptan as a nasal spray, but this method of administration is considered to be significantly less effective at reducing CH symptoms than sumatriptan injections.', 'Always inform a doctor if a person is on a course of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) medication before taking sumatriptan. SSRIs increase the levels of serotonin in the brain, a property which sumatriptan shares. Using two serotonergic medications, agents which increase serotonin levels, simultaneously can lead to serotonin syndrome: an adverse reaction to having too much serotonin in the body.', 'Recovery after a CH attack', 'CH attacks can be physically exhausting. Although the pain of a cluster headache will alleviate after using an abortive agent, the affected person is likely to benefit from a period of recovery, which may involve resting, spending time in a calm, quiet room and drinking water to stay hydrated.', 'If a person is likely to be affected by CH attacks at work, it is recommended that they inform their workplace, so that their employers understand the nature of the condition and can accommodate their needs. During a bout of CHs, these may include working from home or taking several breaks to manage attacks.[17]', 'Long-term treatment for cluster headaches', 'For people who experience cluster headaches so frequently that they cannot manage the condition effectively using oxygen therapy or sumatriptan injections, additional treatments may be recommended. These include:[18][19]', 'Transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (TVNS)', 'This treatment involves providing the affected person with a small, handheld device which they can use to treat CH attacks when they occur. The device can also be used in between attacks to reduce their frequency. The TVNS device works by emitting a low-voltage electrical current, which, when applied to the skin on the neck near the vagus nerve, will stimulate it, relieving tension and pain. However, TVNS can, in rare cases, cause a CH attack to develop, and this treatment option may therefore be unsuitable for some people.[20]', 'Sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) stimulation', 'The sphenopalatine ganglion is a nerve bundle which is located behind the nose. In people affected by CHs, low-voltage electrical stimulation of of the SPG can relieve the pain of a CH attack. SPG stimulation requires the implantation of a device – which is smaller than an almond – into the side of the face.[21]', 'General anaesthetic is used to implant the device, and a small incision is made in the upper gum on the side most affected by CHs. The implantation procedure takes around an hour, and there is no visible scarring. After implantation, people affected by CHs can activate the device to stimulate the SPG by using a handheld monitor when they feel an attack coming on. The SPG can also be stimulated between attacks to reduce their frequency.', 'Prevention', 'The causes of cluster headaches are unknown, so it is not possible to prevent the development of the CHs disorder itself. However, using tobacco products is a known cause of CHs, and giving up tobacco products may therefore reduce a person’s chances of developing CHs.', 'People who are affected by CHs can take measures to prevent headache attacks, including avoiding triggers and making healthy lifestyle choices.', 'Being aware of triggers', 'Keeping a diary of the circumstances surrounding one’s CHs can help a person to identify any possible triggers of headache attacks within a bout of CHs. Logging one’s CHs can also potentially help to establish the overall triggers of CH bouts, such as seasonal changes.', 'The affected person can then make lifestyle choices aimed at avoiding triggers, e.g. not wearing perfume in Spring and Fall, if their bouts of CHs generally occur during seasonal changes and strong smells are found to be a likely triggering factor.', 'Good to know: Many known triggers of CHs only cause a person to develop a headache if they are experiencing a bout. During a period of remission, a person may be able to encounter these triggers – such a drinking alcohol in moderation or smelling a strong scent – without being struck by a CH.', 'Preventative medications', 'Preventative medications for CHs vary in effectiveness between people, and a person may need to try several different forms of medication to find the one that is right for them. A person may take preventative medication all year round in the case of chronic cluster headaches, or periodically to prevent headache attacks during a bout.[2] Doctors will help to decide on the preventative medication(s) that are most suitable for each person, according to their pattern of CH bouts and general health.', 'The first-line medication for preventing CHs is a type of medication regularly used in the treatment of high blood pressure, called a calcium channel blocker. In this case, it works to reduce vasoconstriction, which helps prevent CH attacks. These kinds of medications may cause heart problems to develop in some people, so a person’s heart will be monitored regularly, using an ECG machine when they are using this medication, to safeguard against this.[22]', 'Other medications which may be prescribed to as preventative treatments for CHs include:[22][23]', 'Corticosteroids', 'These medications are usually used in bursts of 2-3 weeks, generally to help break a cycle of CHs or in conjunction with other therapies that take longer to take effect. Due to the side-effects associated with long-term use, such as high blood sugar and the thinning of bones, these medications are suitable for short-term use only.', 'Greater optical nerve block', 'This treatment involves injecting an anaesthetic and steroid medication into the nerves that supply the scalp, at the back of the head. It is carried out in hospital by a doctor and can bring about periods of remission in people with CH disorder lasting a month or more. The procedure takes around a minute to perform and can be repeated every two months.', 'Lithium carbonate', 'Most often prescribed to treat chronic cluster headaches, this oral medication can help to re-regulate hormonal imbalances within the brain, reducing the frequency of CH attacks. However, use of this medication must be accompanied by regular blood tests to measure the levels of lithium in the blood. Having elevated levels of lithium for prolonged periods can cause problems such as kidney damage. Problems such as this can be avoided with close medical supervision.[24]', 'Anticonvulsant medication', 'These kinds of medication have been found to be effective in inducing periods of remission in people affected by CHs and in reducing the frequency of attacks when taken long-term. It is taken orally, and the dosage is usually increased over time at the discretion of a person’s doctor.[25]', 'Making healthy lifestyle choices', 'Although medical treatments are usually needed in order to bring cluster headache disorder under control, many people who are affected by CHs find that making certain changes to their lifestyle can help them in managing the condition and can reduce the frequency of headache attacks. These include:', 'Relaxation', 'Practicing relaxation skills such as yoga and deep breathing can help to diffuse stress and aid muscle relaxation. Setting aside periods of the day for relaxation and taking regular breaks from activities which involve sitting or standing in the same position can help to diffuse the buildups of muscle and nerve tension that contribute to CHs.', 'Resting well', 'Getting eight hours of sleep a night and going to bed at the same time each day can help to reduce stress, which can reduce the frequency of CHs.', 'Exercising regularly', 'Exercise releases beta-endorphins in the body, which can relieve stress. Exercising for 20 minutes, three times per week, can help to decrease the frequency of CHs and the severity of individual attacks.', 'Staying hydrated', 'Drinking eight glasses of water or other non-alcoholic, non-caffeinated beverages per day can help. For people who are affected by chronic or persistent CHs, opting for non-alcoholic beverages instead of drinks containing alcohol all year round can help to prevent CHs. Cutting down on, or cutting out, caffeine, can also help prevent CHs.', 'Seeking help to quit using tobacco products', 'The likelihood of being affected by CHs is greater among people who consume tobacco products than those who do not. In people with CHs, quitting is recommended. Doctors will be able to provide a range of resources on quitting smoking and connect a person to support programmes suited to their needs.', 'Complications associated with cluster headaches', 'Although  a person may worry that they are dying during a cluster headache due to the intensity of the pain, this condition is not life-threatening and does not pose any direct health risks. However, relative to the general population, people affected by CHs may be more prone to certain behaviors which carry severe health risks, including:[10]', '\nInjuring themselves during CH attacks\nAlcohol abuse\nOther forms of substance abuse\nSuicide attempts, in particular in cases of severe and persistent CHs)\n', 'Diagnosing and beginning treatment for CHs is the best means of minimising these risks and avoiding complications.', 'For people who have been correctly diagnosed with this condition, and who are being treated effectively, the most likely negative impact of CHs is a reduced quality of life, due to having to spend time away from work, education or social events during headache attacks. The extent to which a person’s quality of life is reduced by CHs can, in many cases, be lessened by accessing effective treatment options.', 'Cluster headaches FAQs', 'Q: What are the key differences between a cluster headache and a migraine?\nA: Cluster headaches are unilateral (affecting one side of the head). This is one of the principal factors which distinguish CHs from migraines. Migraines involve a more generalized pain and typically affect both sides of the head at once. Additionally, the duration of a migraine is usually much longer than that of a CH, up to 72 hours.[26] People affected by a migraine tend to want to sit or lie down, whereas a person experiencing a CH is prone to agitated movement.', 'Read more about Migraine Headache »', 'Q: Are any home remedies or natural products effective at treating CHs?\nA: The two most popular natural remedies for cluster headaches are:', '\nMelatonin. Taking supplements of melatonin, a hormone found naturally in the body which helps regulate sleep cycles, has been found to help reduce the frequency of cluster headache attacks.[27]\nCapsaicin.

In the evidence-based guidelines on treatments for cluster headaches devised by the American Headache Society, melatonin supplements are rated at grade C, i.e. possibly, rather than probably or certainly, helpful as a treatment for CHs, and intranasally applied capsaicin is rated at grade U, meaning that there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation.[29]', 'If a person wishes to incorporate natural remedies such as these into their treatment plan for CHs, they should consult a doctor before choosing natural products or beginning to use them. These treatments may not be suitable for everyone.

Those affected by CHs will require both short and long-term treatment in order to manage their headache disorder:', '\nShort-term treatment for CHs focuses on relieving headache attacks themselves by reducing their pain and duration\nLong-term treatment of CHs aims to reduce the frequency of headache attacks and to prolong the periods of remission between bouts. With effective treatment, a person affected by chronic CHs may be able to reduce the frequency of their headaches to the point at which their CH disorder becomes episodic.\n', 'Short-term treatment: managing a cluster headache attack', 'After having diagnosed CHs, doctors will discuss a range of treatments which a person can use during a headache attack in order to relieve their pain. The pain associated with a CH is so severe that it cannot be alleviated with traditional over-the-counter (OTC) painkillers.', 'Specialized treatments for CHs can usually relieve headache pain in 15-30 minutes. These treatments are called abortive agents because they begin to relieve (abort) pain more quickly than OTC painkillers, which are designed to be swallowed. They can be administered by vaporisation, i.e. breathing them in through the nose, or by injection into a muscle, or vein.[14]', 'The principal abortive agents used to relieve the symptoms of a CH attack are oxygen therapy and sumatriptan injections.', 'Oxygen therapy', 'This treatment involves breathing in pure oxygen through a mask at the start of a CH attack. Masks and containers of pure oxygen will be provided by a person’s doctor, and they will be shown how to use the equipment so that they can carry out this treatment themselves, independently, whenever a CH strikes.', 'The rate at which the oxygen is dispensed from the container can be adjusted, and people are usually recommended to breathe in oxygen at a rate of around 15 litres per minute at the start of the attack, which they can decrease to a rate of six to eight litres per minute when the symptoms subside. It is important to continue breathing in the oxygen for five to ten minutes after the attack has finished, otherwise it may return.', 'Sumatriptan (triptan class medication) injections', 'Sumatriptan is a medication which is used in the treatment of migraines and cluster headaches. It works by narrowing the blood vessels in the brain, which stops the transmission of pain signals. Sumatriptan works best as an abortive agent when injected into the skin and can be injected into the outside of the thigh or upper arm. Never inject sumatriptan into a vein or muscle.[15]', 'A person’s doctor will demonstrate how to inject sumatriptan, and these injections are then safe to use independently, ideally at the first sign of a CH attack. Sumatriptan is most effective when used at the start of a CH attack. Doctors will recommend the appropriate dose and dosing schedule in each case.[16]', 'It is also possible to use sumatriptan as a nasal spray, but this method of administration is considered to be significantly less effective at reducing CH symptoms than sumatriptan injections.', 'Always inform a doctor if a person is on a course of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) medication before taking sumatriptan. SSRIs increase the levels of serotonin in the brain, a property which sumatriptan shares. Using two serotonergic medications, agents which increase serotonin levels, simultaneously can lead to serotonin syndrome: an adverse reaction to having too much serotonin in the body.', 'Recovery after a CH attack', 'CH attacks can be physically exhausting. Although the pain of a cluster headache will alleviate after using an abortive agent, the affected person is likely to benefit from a period of recovery, which may involve resting, spending time in a calm, quiet room and drinking water to stay hydrated.', 'If a person is likely to be affected by CH attacks at work, it is recommended that they inform their workplace, so that their employers understand the nature of the condition and can accommodate their needs. During a bout of CHs, these may include working from home or taking several breaks to manage attacks.[17]', 'Long-term treatment for cluster headaches', 'For people who experience cluster headaches so frequently that they cannot manage the condition effectively using oxygen therapy or sumatriptan injections, additional treatments may be recommended. These include:[18][19]', 'Transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (TVNS)', 'This treatment involves providing the affected person with a small, handheld device which they can use to treat CH attacks when they occur. The device can also be used in between attacks to reduce their frequency. The TVNS device works by emitting a low-voltage electrical current, which, when applied to the skin on the neck near the vagus nerve, will stimulate it, relieving tension and pain. However, TVNS can, in rare cases, cause a CH attack to develop, and this treatment option may therefore be unsuitable for some people.[20]', 'Sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) stimulation', 'The sphenopalatine ganglion is a nerve bundle which is located behind the nose. In people affected by CHs, low-voltage electrical stimulation of of the SPG can relieve the pain of a CH attack. SPG stimulation requires the implantation of a device – which is smaller than an almond – into the side of the face.[21]', 'General anaesthetic is used to implant the device, and a small incision is made in the upper gum on the side most affected by CHs. The implantation procedure takes around an hour, and there is no visible scarring. After implantation, people affected by CHs can activate the device to stimulate the SPG by using a handheld monitor when they feel an attack coming on. The SPG can also be stimulated between attacks to reduce their frequency.']"
['Colorectal Cancer'],"['Colorectal cancer, or bowel cancer, is the most common cancer of the digestive tract. It arises from the colon (large intestine) or the rectum (final portion of the large intestine). Most colorectal cancers are diagnosed in adults older than 60. Almost all colorectal cancers start as benign (non-cancerous) growths that slowly progress into cancer. These polyps can be found early via regular screening. Although people with colorectal cancer may have no symptoms, some people experience abdominal pain, blood in their stool, a change in bowel habits and weight loss. Early diagnosis and treatment is important in giving the best chance of surviving bowel cancer.']","['Symptoms of colorectal cancer may include a change in bowel habits, pain in the lower abdomen, blood in stool, unexpected weight loss and a feeling of tiredness and difficulty performing everyday tasks. Many people with colorectal cancer do not have symptoms in the early stages, so screening (testing people without symptoms) is important.']",,"['The treatment of colorectal cancer depends on the size of the cancer, the exact type of cancer and whether the cancer has spread. The combination of these factors decides the stage of the cancer. Depending on the stage, colorectal cancer can be treated by radiotherapy, surgery and chemotherapy, or a combination of therapies. The treating doctor can give the best advice as to treatment. People who have had bowel cancer may benefit taking part in a support group or counseling program, especially while undergoing treatment.']"
['Colostomy'],"['A colostomy, or bowel diversion, is a surgical procedure used to divert one end or a loop of the large intestine out through the wall of the abdomen. An incision is made in the skin and through the abdominal wall to create an opening called a stoma, sometimes also known as an ostomy. Over this, a small pouch – known as a colostomy bag – is placed in order to collect excreted stool and other human waste.[1]', 'Colostomies can be permanent or temporary (around 65 percent of procedures are permanent). They are used to treat a variety of conditions that affect the large bowel (colon) and lower digestive tract, such as Crohn’s disease, colorectal cancer and ulcerative colitis. It is generally considered a routine procedure, yet it does carry some risks.[2]', 'Reasons for needing a colostomy', 'Temporary colostomy surgery may be necessary following surgeries to remove or repair part of the large intestine. This form of bowel diversion allows stool and other waste to be diverted away from the repaired section of the colon, through the opening in the abdomen, giving the surgery site a chance to recover and heal.', 'In contrast, a permanent version creates an artificial outlet for stool, and is necessary when the body can no longer rid itself of these substances as the digestive system would normally, through the anus. This may be needed if the surgery involves the removal of the lowest part of the colon (the rectum) or the anal sphincter muscles.', 'Conditions and diseases that may require a permanent approach include:[3]', ""\nAbdominal/pelvic region cancers including colorectal cancer and more rarely anal, vaginal or cervical cancer\nInflammatory bowel diseases including Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and, more rarely, diverticulitis\nBowel obstructions or injuries\nFecal incontinence (in severe cases)\nHirschsprung’s disease (a rare disease where the bowel lacks nerve cells)\n"", 'Types of colostomy', 'There are a variety of different colostomy types, each corresponding to a different section of the colon.[4]', '\nSigmoid: This is the most common type of colostomy, affecting the lower portion of the colon. A suitable treatment for conditions affecting the part of the colon near the anus, such as perianal Crohn’s disease.\nTransverse loop: A transverse colostomy affects the top of the abdomen. This procedure externalises a loop of the intestine creating two openings; the proximal end – to which the pouch is fixed – and the distal end – which is inactive (no stool comes from this end).\nTransverse single-barrel: This technique creates a single opening through the abdominal wall. It is permanent, and sometimes called a terminal colostomy.\nTransverse double-barrel: In this method, the two ends of the bowel are sutured together and passed through the abdominal wall.\nDescending: This method is performed on the left-side of the colon. Having already passed through the right-side of the colon, the output is solid and controllable.\nAscending: This method is performed on the right-side of the colon. Output is typically liquid. This is a rare operation because a stoma of the small intestine is usually preferred.\n', 'Good to know: A person will be provided with recommendations to help prepare for their particular surgery. These may be different depending on each case; if a person has colorectal cancer, they may be recommended a different procedure and prep guidelines to someone with Crohn’s disease, for example. One may be given written related literature to consult, such as a colostomy guide. The colostomy guide will typically include instructions on food and liquid intake, clearing the bowel of stool and other waste, as well as recommended supplies and recovery tips.', 'Always call the doctor with any questions about the preparatory process, as it is important to follow all guidelines as closely as possible for best results.', 'Reversal of a temporary colostomy', 'Reversing a temporary colostomy is generally a routine procedure carried out when the colon has healed. After reversal, stool and other waste will be excreted through the anus as normal and the stoma and pouch will no longer be needed. Reversal is normally carried out between 12 weeks and a number of years after the initial procedure, depending on a person’s recovery.[5]', 'Risks of a colostomy', 'Although considered a fairly routine surgical procedure, colostomies still carry the chance of complications. As with any major surgical procedure, there are risks due to going under general anaesthesia and blood loss, as well as colostomy specific risks that include:', '\nSkin complications, ranging from mild irritation to ulceration and infection (present in 18 to 55 percent of cases)\nRetraction – when the stoma in the abdomen recedes into the skin (present in 32 to 40 percent of cases)\nParastomal hernia (present in 14 to 40 percent of cases)\nNecrosis, caused by insufficient blood supply to the stoma (present in 2 to 22 percent of cases)\nStomal prolapse – when the stoma becomes displaced (present in 2 to 22 percent of cases). This is more likely to occur when the muscle tone in the abdomen is poor, or in cases of excessive weight gain or obesity.\n', 'Life after a colostomy', 'Immediately following a temporary or permanent colostomy, a hospital stay of roughly two-weeks should be expected. To fully recover, however, two months may be needed. After recovery, modern advancements in colostomy care and improvements in pouch design mean that – following a period of adaptation – most people are able to lead a relatively normal life.', 'This includes being able to go back to work, enjoy a regular diet and take part in physical activity.[6] Individuals who have undergone colostomy surgery should, however, be aware that their stoma and pouch do need to be looked after to keep them functioning correctly.[7] Advice on how to do this and how to change a colostomy bag will be given by doctors and nurses after the procedure has taken place.', 'Good to know: In some cases, colostomy irrigation may be recommended. This is a method for people who have had permanent colostomies to achieve regular bowel movements, by flushing their colon with water inserted through the stoma, daily or every two days. This allows waste to exit the body as normal through the rectum and anus, as an alternative to collecting stool in a colostomy bag. Colostomy irrigation can help prevent constipation and is ideal for people who had regular bowel function before surgery, and whose colostomies affected the sigmoid portion of the colon.', '', '\n\nHealthline. “Colostomy.” Accessed July 4, 2017. ↩\n\nThe New York Times. “Colostomy.” Accessed July 4, 2017. ↩\n\nNHS Choices. “Colostomy.” April 28, 2015.

['Colostomy Bag'],"['A colostomy bag, also called a stoma bag or ostomy bag, is a small, waterproof pouch used to collect waste from the body.', 'During a surgical procedure known as a colostomy, an opening, called a stoma or ostomy, is formed between the large intestine (colon) and the abdominal wall. This allows waste products to be excreted through the opening in the abdominal wall rather than via the colon through the rectum and anus. Stool and other waste products are drainable into the pouch, which can then be emptied at regular intervals.', 'This procedure is carried out in the treatment of conditions involving damage to the colon or large intestine, such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease, diverticulitis or colorectal cancer. The pouch is placed over the new opening that has been created in the abdominal wall –  in order to collect stool and other waste from the body.[1]', 'An ostomy bag, therefore, is a fairly simple device intended to rest the patient’s colon\nin the case of a temporary procedure, or to act as an artificial outlet for the bowel when the\nsurgery is intended as permanent.', 'The use of a pouch to collect waste outside the body:', '\nIs surprisingly common\nIs not painful\nDoesn’t necessarily involve a huge change of lifestyle\n', 'Full guidelines on changing a colostomy bag and/or using a drainable version will be provided by the clinic that is treating the affected person, as well as advice on finding all necessary supplies, such as replacement pouches.', 'When is a colostomy bag needed?', 'Colostomies can be necessary for people of all ages.

The pouch is used to collect waste thereafter.\n', 'Both procedures are considered routine, however, the exact method will depend on factors such as the medical condition that is being treated, and whether continence is expected to eventually be restored after recovery by means of a follow-up procedure known as colostomy reversal.', 'Both loop and end procedures are usually performed using keyhole surgery, as an inpatient procedure at the clinic, but some situations may require open surgery. Open surgery often has a longer recovery time.', 'Ileostomy', 'This is a similar procedure that also entails the use of a stoma bag, which sometimes termed an ileostomy bag to differentiate. It is commonly carried out as a treatment for ulcerative colitis. This surgery involves bringing the small intestine out of the body to divert waste, then placing a stoma bag over the opening.[4] Bodily waste is then drainable through the opening, and does not need to pass through the colon and rectum.', 'Urostomy', 'A urostomy – also called an ileal conduit – is a procedure that creates a stoma specifically to drain urine when passage through the bladder and urethra is not possible. A urostomy bag, which is of similar design to a colostomy bag, is used to collect the urine, which is then drainable via the stoma. A urostomy is a permanent procedure.', 'Is a colostomy bag permanent?', 'Use can be temporary or permanent, depending on the type of surgery needed to treat the underlying medical condition. Temporary colostomies tend to be “loop colostomies” whereas permanent colostomies tend to be “end colostomies.”[5]', 'Colostomy reversal', 'In the case of a temporary colostomy, surgery is needed to reverse the colostomy. This involves removing the colostomy bag and reconnecting the bowel, so that waste can then exit the body normal via the rectum and anus; the stoma will no be longer required. This is generally carried out 12 weeks or more after the initial surgery, but this time can be longer if complications arise during recovery. The procedure is considered straightforward and can usually be carried out using keyhole surgery.', 'Living with a colostomy bag', 'After a patient is fitted with a colostomy bag, doctors, nurses stoma care experts or colostomy specialists will thoroughly explain how to maintain the stoma and what lifestyle changes may be necessary for adapting to using the pouch. Below is some general information and advice that should be noted by all colostomy bag users.', 'How does a colostomy bag work?', 'Generally, colostomy bags consist of two pieces:[6]', '\nThe flange, which adheres to the skin and should be changed every one to two days\nThe detachable pouch, which catches the waste.\n', 'One piece systems, where the flange and bag are attached to each other, and are both disposed of and replaced simultaneously, are also available.', 'Choosing a colostomy bag', 'Bags come in a wide variety of different sizes and capacities, and most brands offer each bag they make with a one-piece or two-piece option. Different bags may be suitable for different occasions and purposes. For example, a person may choose to use:', '\nA larger size stoma bag while sleeping, i.e. one which can hold around 650 ml of waste. This will help them to avoid leakage, as they cannot control or predict the volume of their nightly waste output.\nA small stoma bag during their waking hours, when it can be changed as needed. I.e. one which can hold around 400 ml of waste.\n', 'It is generally recommended that a person empty their colostomy pouch when it is one third to one half full. The smaller a colostomy pouch is, the more often it will need to be emptied.', 'Colostomy specialists will assist in deciding which type of colostomy bag suits the individual needs of a person. Factors that will be considered in helping a person choose the right kind(s) of bag for them include:[7]', '\nWhere the stoma is in relation to the rest of the person’s digestive tract, which will help determine the volume of waste output. The higher up the digestive tract the stoma is, the greater the volume of waste output will be.\nWhat kind of procedure the person had and how much of their gastrointestinal system will still be functioning as normal when the bag is in use, which will help determine the volume of waste output and the expected firmness of stools. In general, the smaller the section of the colon that is removed, the firmer a person’s stool will be.\nTheir lifestyle, including diet and physical demands of daily life, as well as any environments or activities that may require a particular size or style of pouch, i.e. wearing tight-fitting clothing, in which case a less bulky option may be preferred.\n', 'Choosing a disposable or reusable bag', 'All colostomy bags are designed to be changed and replaced regularly, but some types need to be changed more often than others. Choosing which type of colostomy bag to use is largely a matter of preference. Many people swap between different types, depending on their day’s activities.', 'The two main types of colostomy bag, both of which come in a wide range of sizes and capacities, are:', 'Closed-end pouches', 'These are designed for one-time use. They are often fitted with a filter designed to reduce gas buildup and prevent odors. Changing a closed-end pouch can be done as often as a person wishes and involves discarding the used pouch in a disposable bag - which is often provided with the pouch - and attaching a new pouch to the stoma.', 'Many people who have undergone a colostomy choose to use closed-end pouches every day. Others choose to use them at certain times, i.e. for going to the beach or before sexual activity, when having a fresh/empty pouch may be considered ideal.', 'Drainable pouches', 'Rinse-and-reuse drainable pouches are suitable for people who have had all types of colostomy and ileostomies. They can be emptied into the toilet as needed and can be cleaned with water if necessary and resealed with a clip or velcro fastening.', 'Many people prefer drainable pouches to single-use, closed-end pouches, as they do not need to be changed as often, and are therefore more economical and environmentally friendly.', 'Drainable pouches are usually fitted with a filter to reduce odors and drain gas. A drainable pouch should be discarded and replaced with a new one every three to four days. The functionality of the filter may decrease after this time, increasing the possibility that the bag could begin to smell. Furthermore, although it is easy to keep the outer parts of drainable pouches clean, changing the appliance regularly reduces any potential buildup of bacteria and minimises the risk of infection around the stoma.', 'Good to know: People who have undergone an ileostomy often choose to use a drainable pouch in everyday life, and a closed-end, single use pouch for particular occasions only. This is because a high volume of liquid stool is normal following an ileostomy. Many people find changing a single-use bag on a frequent basis costly and inconvenient.', 'How to change a colostomy bag', 'The pouch can be changed as often as needed – usually, shortly after a bowel movement.\nAt first, the procedure may prove difficult but will get easier with practice. For basic guidelines,\nfollow these six steps:[8]', '\nThoroughly wash your hands using antibacterial gel or soap.\nGently ease the pouch from the stoma, using adhesive remover to help if necessary.\nBy removing or cutting away the bottom section, empty the pouch of stool and other waste, into the toilet. If you don’t want to do this, pouches can be disposed of in their entirety into a disposal bag.\nClean the stoma with warm water and mild soap and thoroughly dry with a dry wipe.\nPrepare the new pouch by removing the protective cover from the flange.\nPlace the flange over the stoma, ensuring there are no creases.\n', 'Ensuring good adherence', 'To ensure a tight seal over the stoma in the abdomen, the skin should be clean and dry. Humid conditions and increased sweating may therefore lead to reduced wear-time, so keeping a ready stock of replacement pouches is advised.', 'Colostomy bag accessories and supplies', 'Aside from the basic components (flanges, pouches), there are a variety of accessories available to help with stoma care and use. The most commonly-used accessories include:[9]', '\nBelts: Belts help secure the colostomy bag to the body, reducing the risk of dislodgement and leakage.\nStoma paste:  These pastes help adhere the flange to the skin of the abdomen.\nStoma powder: Used to dry sore or inflamed skin around the stoma, allowing the flange to be applied more easily and effectively.\nWipes: Wipes can be used to clean the skin, remove adhesive residue or to form a protective film between the stoma and flange.\n', 'Day-to-day life', 'Generally, colostomy bag users are able to lead a normal life and take part in all the activities they wish to. There are, however, a few tips to keep in mind to avoid damage to the colostomy bag.', '\nSpare colostomy bags and accessories should be carried whenever possible. Patients typically have less control over continence following a colostomy, meaning the pouch may need to be changed unexpectedly when away from home.\nCaution should be taken with pets or children who may unintentionally dislodge or damage the colostomy bag.\nFood and drinks that cause flatulence, such as carbonated drinks, beans, cauliflower, cabbage, etc. should be avoided.\nOnce the stoma has healed, sports and exercise are possible. Specialized supports and smaller, more agile pouches are available to aid in this.\n', 'Bathing and showering', 'When bathing or showering, the colostomy bag can be either left in place or removed. If left in place, the outside of the filter should be covered using a sticky patch (that should be supplied by the hospital/doctor) to prevent any damage. If removed, it is best to select a time when the stoma will be less active – before, rather than following, a meal, for example. Before refitting the colostomy bag, ensure the skin around the stoma is completely dry.', 'Clothing', 'Generally, clothing able to comfortably support a colostomy bag can be found in regular clothing outlets. However, clothing designed specifically with the needs of users in mind is also available from specialist outlets. Items include high-waisted trousers to suit those with a waist-level stoma, high-waisted underwear and specially designed swimsuits.', 'Sexual activity', 'A healthy sex life is generally possible for people living with a colostomy pouch. The main obstacle may be embarrassment, which may be helped by the use of a smaller pouch or by wearing clothing that covers or secures the device in place.', 'Replenishing supplies', 'After surgery, appliances and accessories will be supplied by the clinic, along with a prescription detailing the person’s requirements. When running low, the prescription can be taken to a doctor or pharmacy for replenishment of all essential items.', 'Good to know: It is usually possible to obtain a certain amount of free supplies on a long-term basis on prescription from one’s national healthcare provider. The National Health Service (NHS) in the U.K. recommends a monthly allowance of 30 to 90 single-use bags or 15 to 30 drainable (ileostomy) bags, and around 15 flanges.[10] Medicare in the U.S. offers a policy which covers around 80 percent of the cost of a person’s supplies after a doctor has confirmed the specific items and quantities required.[11]', 'Colostomy bag FAQs', 'Q: After surgery for Crohn’s disease, will a pouch be needed permanently?\nA: Not usually. The type of surgery which is usually recommended in Crohn’s disease is called a resection.[12] Doctors will consider performing a resection to remove the sections of the intestine which are inflamed, or damaged by inflammation. A resection of the intestine is carried out in cases where the symptoms of Crohn’s disease have not been alleviated by other treatments. When the inflamed sections of the intestine have been removed, the healthy sections will be stitched together. A resection is a major procedure and usually performed under general anaesthetic.', 'In people with Crohn’s disease who have undergone a resection, ileostomy may be prescribed, to divert stool and other digestive waste away from the colon to give the area of the intestine, which has undergone a resection, a chance to heal. Whether this is temporary or permanent depends on the nature of a person’s Crohn’s disease, their post-surgery recovery and their overall medical history. Even if doctors do not recommend reversal and it is decided that the best management plan involves a person using their continence pouch on a permanent basis, many people find that they experience a greatly improved quality of life with the pouch, compared to their previous experiences of managing Crohn’s disease.[13]', 'However, the type of surgery usually prescribed to treat Crohn’s disease is a loop form of the procedure, which is temporary. Most people with Crohn’s disease who have undergone this procedure will be able to have it reversed following successful healing. They will excrete waste via the rectum and anus as normal thereafter. See this resource for more information about Crohn’s disease.', 'Q: How can I learn to be comfortable with the idea that using a colostomy bag will be part of my life on a long-term or permanent basis?\nA: There are many support groups, online and in real life, that exist specifically to help people, who are new to using a colostomy bag, adjust to the lifestyle changes that it necessitates. Social networks that help people connect with others who use colostomy bags are specifically designed for sharing tips and techniques to help people overcome any misgivings that they may have and to promote awareness that it is possible to live a normal, happy life after a temporary of permanent colostomy.', 'Dedicated websites and forums, such as More Than Your Bag, Coloplast and Living with a Stoma encourage people with all types of colostomy bags to share success stories. These personal narratives are intended to inspire others to feel positive about the improvements that their colostomy and use of a colostomy bag have brought to their health, rather than feeling disappointed about needing to use one.', 'Furthermore, over the past few decades, an increasing number of celebrities with colostomy bags and ostomies have spoken out about their usefulness.[14] This has further helped to normalize the idea that a person may require colostomy surgery during their lifetime. Furthermore, these stories help to show that everybody who undergoes a colostomy can go on to use their bag without problems and with a positive mindset, embracing the freedoms it offers.', 'Q: What is a colonoscopy bag?\nA: There is no such thing as a colonoscopy bag, but it is very understandable to get confused, because colostomy and colonoscopy are such similar-sounding words. However, the definitions of these two procedures and their outcomes are very different. Simply put:', '\nA colonoscopy is a scanning procedure, in which a thin flexible tube with a camera on its end is inserted into the bowel via the anus and rectum. The only function of a colonoscopy is to provide images of the inside of the bowel; no changes to the body are made.\nA colostomy is a surgical procedure in which an ostomy is created to provide an alternative means for waste to exit the body, temporarily or permanently. After a person has undergone a colostomy to create their ostomy, they will need to collect waste using a colostomy bag.\n', 'Situations in which a person may undergo a colonoscopy include:', '\nDiagnosis: Doctors may wish to see the inside of the bowel in order to find out more about what might be causing a person’s symptoms.\nBefore surgery: It is standard practice for surgeons to perform a colonoscopy in the run-up to many kinds of colorectal surgery. People who undergo a colostomy very often have a colonoscopy beforehand.\n', 'See this resource for more information on preparing for a colonoscopy, and, for information about the variety of conditions that can be diagnosed with the aid of a colonoscopy, download the Ada app.', 'Q: Is it safe to wear a colostomy bag during a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scan?\nA: Yes, in some cases. When undergoing an MRI scan, it may not be possible to wear certain types of bag and flange which use magnets in their mechanism of attachment. This is because bringing magnets into the scanner can disrupt the imaging process and, furthermore, can compromise the magnetism of the device. However, it will be possible to check with your doctor and the radiology team  in advance of the scan whether your colostomy appliances are suitable.', 'People who use a colostomy bag and who are undergoing a CT scan with the use of contrast material should inform the person who will be performing the scan in advance. See this resource for more information about contrast material and undergoing a CT scanFor all types of imaging scan, people who use a colostomy bag, are encouraged to bring spare supplies with them on the day of the scan in case a fresh bag is required.', 'Q: What is a colostomy bag cover?\nA: Feeling positive about the way that your colostomy bag looks is a key means of eliminating any negative impact it may initially have on your lifestyle or choice of activities. There are many companies which make attractive covers for colostomy bags out of different materials, and it is possible to order covers that are custom-made from the material of your choice.', 'Covers can be useful in situations such as going exercising or to the beach. If you would prefer not to display the bag itself, which may be visible in swimwear or sportswear, wearing a cover removes the need to wear extra clothing for this purpose.', 'Many outlets specialize in colostomy bag covers for specific types of activity, for example, purpose-built swimwear or underwear-style covers for intimate occasions. These can easily be purchased online. It is also possible to make colostomy bag covers oneself, using a sewing pattern to ensure accurate sizing.', '', '\n\nThe Independent.

The method chosen by the doctor or dermatologist will depend on the severity of the warts, the symptoms and the general health of the individual.[9]', '\nSalicylic acid: This is a common method for treating warts. Salicylic acid works by gradually dissolving layers of the wart tissue, eventually resulting in total removal. It is generally applied to the wart as a gel or liquid. Though salicylic acid is also available in over-the-counter products, prescription varieties are typically stronger and more effective. Along with peeling away the surface of the warts, salicylic acid may also encourage the body’s immune system to combat the virus.\nCryotherapy: Generally performed by a doctor or dermatologist, cryotherapy is a method of freezing warts using liquid nitrogen.

The word congenital means present at or before birth, while hypothyroidism refers to insufficient levels of thyroid hormone. While congenital hypothyroidism is a serious condition, it can generally be detected and treated early enough to prevent complications, thanks to routine screenings after birth in many parts of the world.[1][2][3]', 'The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland found in the lower part of the neck, just below the voice box. Hormones released by the thyroid control the body’s growth and metabolism. They affect key physical processes like heart rate, digestion, weight and temperature.[4] Adequate levels of thyroid hormone are essential for the healthy physical and mental development of a baby.[2]', 'Congenital hypothyroidism affects approximately 1 in every 2000 to 4000 newborns[5] and has been found to be more common in female babies.[1] The condition occurs when the baby’s thyroid gland does not develop or function properly. In the majority of cases, the gland itself is absent, smaller than normal or located in the wrong place. However, congenital hypothyroidism may also result when the gland is normal, but there are problems with the production of thyroid hormone.[6]', 'In the USA, UK and many other parts of the world, all newborn babies are screened for congenital hypothyroidism within a few days of birth. A simple heel-prick blood test is typically used, and if the results suggest the presence of congenital hypothyroidism, further tests will be done to confirm the diagnosis. Where necessary, treatment with synthetic thyroid hormone will be started without delay.[1][2][6][7]', 'If left untreated, congenital hypothyroidism can lead to severe, irreversible mental impairment and poor growth. However, with prompt, proper treatment and monitoring, the prognosis is excellent, and infants with congenital hypothyroidism will usually grow up to lead normal, healthy lives.[1][2][6][8]']","['Most newborn babies with congenital hypothyroidism show no obvious signs of the condition.[5] This may be because they receive some of their parent’s thyroid hormone before being delivered. They may also be able to produce a small amount of their own.[1][8]', 'However, some babies affected by congenital hypothyroidism may be less active, sleep a lot and be difficult to feed.[6][9] If congenital hypothyroidism is severe, the following signs and symptoms may also be present:[1][2][5][9]', '\nWeak cry\nPoor feeding\nConstipation\nDry skin\nPoor muscle tone (floppiness)\nCold hands and feet; they may also be mottled\nProlonged jaundice (yellow skin)\nPuffy face\nLarge tongue\nSwollen stomach\nUmbilical hernia\nLarge fontanelles (the soft spots on a baby’s head)\n', 'It is important that a newborn baby be screened for congenital hypothyroidism as early as possible in order to prevent complications.', 'In many countries, babies are screened sufficiently soon after birth that they will generally not have symptoms of congenital hypothyroidism. However, in rare cases, a baby with the condition may have symptoms immediately after birth.[5]', 'In parts of the world where screening is not performed, a baby may not show symptoms of congenital hypothyroidism initially, but they will typically develop symptoms in the first few months after birth.[5] If you are concerned about any symptoms, you can do a free assessment using the Ada app.']","['The most common cause of congenital hypothyroidism is the baby’s thyroid gland not developing properly. The gland may be absent, smaller than normal, or positioned in the wrong part of the neck.

In many cases, it will be necessary to take levothyroxine for life.[2][9]', 'Levothyroxine comes in tablets, which should be crushed and given to the baby in a small amount of water or milk every day. A doctor will advise on the dose needed, as well as what foods to avoid giving the baby before and after taking the medication. It is important not to mix the tablets with soy formula or any preparation containing concentrated iron or calcium. When the child is older, they can swallow the tablets on their own with a cup of water. The dose will need to be adjusted as the child grows up.[5][9]', 'Prompt, proper treatment with levothyroxine can generally prevent complications from congenital hypothyroidism. The medication is generally considered safe and has no side-effects at the correct dose. If the dose is too low, symptoms of hypothyroidism may develop, while too high a dose can lead to symptoms of hyperthyroidism.[3]', 'Monitoring', 'In many cases, a doctor will recommend working with a pediatric endocrinologist (a specialist in childhood conditions related to hormones) to help manage the baby’s congenital hypothyroidism as they grow up.[2][3][9]', 'The baby will need to have regular medical check-ups to make sure that their thyroid hormone levels are adequate for healthy growth and development. Regular blood tests will also be required. Until the baby is one year old, tests will usually be necessary every one to three months or more frequently. Thereafter, it may be possible to reduce the frequency of blood tests. A doctor will adjust the dose of levothyroxine as needed.[3][9]', 'Developmental assessment', 'A doctor will also monitor the height, weight and overall growth and development of the child.[3] They will periodically assess the child’s language and communication skills, motor ability and behavior.[1] If it seems necessary, a doctor may recommend having the child’s development formally evaluated. Should there be any delays in speech or learning, an early intervention program can often be arranged to assist the child.[3]', 'Congenital hypothyroidism FAQs', 'Q: Will a baby with congenital hypothyroidism grow up normally?\nA: If a baby with congenital hypothyroidism is diagnosed and treated promptly and correctly, the prognosis is excellent. The child has a good chance of leading a normal, healthy life. If diagnosis and treatment is delayed, however, serious developmental problems may occur.[1][2][3][9]', 'In babies with severe congenital hypothyroidism, it is possible that there may be long-term neurocognitive (mental) effects. If treatment is not started promptly or the dosage or administering of levothyroxine is incorrect, the child may experience developmental delays.[3][8][9]', 'Q: Is levothyroxine safe for babies?\nA: Yes. Levothyroxine is a synthetic version of the thyroid hormone produced by healthy thyroid glands. It is very effective and is considered safe to take every day, for babies, children and adults with hypothyroidism.

A stye or sty, is a small, red, painful bump on the edge of the eyelid, which develops when an oil gland becomes infected with bacteria. It may resemble a pimple or boil.[7][8]', 'General symptoms of conjunctivitis include:[1][2][3][4][5][6]', '\nPinkness or redness of the eye, hence the name “pink eye”\nBurning, itching, a sensation of grittiness, or mild pain or discomfort in the eye\nDischarge from the eye; this may be watery or thick and pus-like, depending on the cause\nFormation of a crust around the eye from discharge[9]\nSwollen and/or reddened eyelids\n', 'Depending on the type of conjunctivitis, other signs and symptoms may be present. One or both eyes may be affected by conjunctivitis. When only one eye is affected, it is called unilateral conjunctivitis. When both eyes are affected, it is called bilateral conjunctivitis. If you think that you may have conjunctivitis, you can use the Ada app to find out more about your symptoms.', 'Many cases of mild conjunctivitis clear up on their own, without specific treatment. Home remedies and over-the-counter (OTC) treatments may be useful. Cleaning the eyes with water and a clean cloth or sterile pad, applying warm or cool compresses and using lubricating eye drops, also known as artificial tears, may help to relieve symptoms. However, antibiotics, antiviral medication or allergy medication may be necessary in more serious cases of conjunctivitis.[1][2][3][4][5][6]', 'Most people make a full recovery from conjunctivitis, and the condition does not typically cause any complications. However, in a small number of cases, pink eye can be very serious, and may cause damage to the eyes if it is not treated effectively.', 'Conjunctivitis can affect people of any age, though bacterial conjunctivitis tends to be more common among children than adults.[4] Bacterial and viral conjunctivitis are highly contagious, which means that the infection can spread easily from one person to another. It is important that a person with infectious conjunctivitis take steps to avoid passing it on to others, such as practising good hygiene.', 'When to see a doctor for pink eye', 'Anyone with severe conjunctivitis symptoms should see a doctor immediately. These include:[4][6]', '\nIntense pain in the eye\nExtreme redness in the eye\nInability to open the eye\nSevere sensitivity to light\nBlurred vision that persists after wiping away discharge\n', 'If symptoms are mild but do not go away, medical advice should also be sought.', 'Furthermore, if conjunctivitis occurs in newborn babies or people with weakened immune systems, such as those who have HIV or are undergoing treatment for cancer, it can be very severe, and medical advice should be sought without delay.']",,,"['In many cases, conjunctivitis in adults and children will clear up on its own, without specific treatment. To relieve discomfort, the following home remedies and over-the-counter treatments may be helpful:[1][3][4][18][19]', '\nGently wiping discharge from the eye with a clean cloth, sterile pad or cotton wool soaked in water\nApplying lubricating eye drops, called artificial tears, which are available without a prescription, to the eye\nApplying a cold or warm compress – a clean cloth that has been soaked in water – to the eye\nAvoiding rubbing the eyes, as this may aggravate symptoms\nAvoiding the use of contact lenses and makeup until the conjunctivitis has cleared\nIn the case of allergic conjunctivitis, avoiding exposure to the allergen, e.g. dust\n', 'In serious cases of conjunctivitis, prescription eye drops and other medicine, such as antihistamine tablets – for allergic conjunctivitis, antibiotics – for bacterial conjunctivitis, and antiviral medication – for viral conjunctivitis, may be recommended. Sometimes, a person will be referred to an eye specialist, an ophthalmologist, for treatment.', 'Good to know: Eye drops, including those used for the treatment of pink eye, have expiration dates set for a specific period after they are first opened. As the efficacy of the ingredients, including the preservatives, may be reduced after the expiry date and harmful bacteria may enter the container, it is important not to use eye drops after the expiration date. It is also important not to share eye drops with other people. Always follow the instructions provided with the eye drops regarding how to use them, as well as how to store them properly, which may include keeping them in a cool, dry place or in the fridge.[20][21]', 'Conjunctivitis (Pink eye) FAQs', 'Q: Are conjunctivitis and pink eye the same thing?\nA: Yes. Conjunctivitis is the medical term for the common eye condition known colloquially as pink eye or pinkeye.', 'Q: Is conjunctivitis contagious?\nA: Whether conjunctivitis is contagious or not depends on the cause. Conjunctivitis caused by bacteria or a virus is highly contagious and can be spread easily from person to person. However, pink eye caused by allergies or irritants is not contagious and cannot be transmitted to other people.', 'Q: Is conjunctivitis airborne?\nA: In some cases, it can be. For example, in the case of allergic conjunctivitis, the condition can be caused by airborne allergens such as pollen. In the case of viral conjunctivitis, it is possible that infection may occur by coming into contact with airborne droplets released when an affected person coughs or sneezes. In many cases of infectious conjunctivitis, however, it is spread by hand-to-eye contact or direct contact with a contaminated object, for example when other family members share towels or washcloths with an infected person.[22]', 'Q: Can conjunctivitis go away by itself?\nA: Yes. In many cases, pink eye is mild and will clear up on its own without any specific treatment. However, in some cases, the condition can be severe and may require treatment with prescription medications. If you have any concerns about an eye condition, it is advisable to consult a doctor.', 'Q: Can pink eye cause a sore throat?\nA: Pink eye itself cannot cause a sore throat. However, pink eye and sore throat may be two symptoms caused by infection with a cold virus, which is a common cause of conjunctivitis. There may also be a runny nose and other signs of a common cold.[23] While uncommon, a person can also experience strep throat and pink eye at the same time. The bacteria that cause strep throat can also cause conjunctivitis.[24]', 'Q: I have had conjunctivitis for several weeks. Do I need to see a doctor?\nA: How long pink eye lasts often depends on the cause: most mild, uncomplicated cases of viral conjunctivitis and bacterial conjunctivitis clear up within 1-2 weeks. If symptoms do not improve after a few days or they get worse, or there is any confusion about what is causing eye symptoms, it is advisable to see a doctor as soon as possible. If antibiotic medicine has been prescribed for bacterial conjunctivitis and symptoms do not begin to improve after 24 hours, a doctor should also be seen.[3][25] If you are concerned, you can use the Ada app to find out more about your symptoms.', 'Associated terms used for conjunctivitis', '\nPink eye, or pinkeye\nEye infection or inflammation\nMadras eye\n', '', '\n\nSouthern Cross Medical Library. “Conjunctivitis (pink eye) - symptoms and treatment.” January, 2018.

['Contact Dermatitis'],"['Contact dermatitis is an inflammation of the skin triggered by a substance the skin has come into contact with. The substance may be an allergen – something that provokes an allergic reaction – or an irritant – something that damages the skin.[1] Inflammation commonly results in red, itchy and cracked skin.[2]', 'Contact dermatitis is a common condition that is more likely to affect people who work with their hands, such as healthcare workers, hairdressers and some factory workers, especially when the work exposes the skin to possible irritants. It is generally a non-serious condition that will clear up with treatment.']","['The symptoms of contact dermatitis occur on the part of the skin that has come into contact with the cause of the irritation.

Of these, irritant contact dermatitis is the most common, accounting for roughly 80 percent of all cases.[1]', 'Irritant contact dermatitis occurs when the skin comes into contact with a substance that irritates the skin. Irritants come in many forms, and may include:[3]', '\nProlonged exposure to water can cause skin irritation, especially if the water contains chlorine or is hard or chalky\nDetergents, such as washing-up liquid, soap or bleach\nSolvents, such as oil, petrol or chemicals found in the workplace\nAcids and alkalis\nDust, soil and powders\nCertain plants, such as clematis, hellebore and poison ivy\n', 'The condition may develop following a single exposure to a very strong irritant, or develop from frequent exposure to a weaker irritant.', 'Allergic contact dermatitis occurs when the skin comes into contact with a specific substance which triggers an allergic reaction, known as an allergen. The allergen can be something the skin has newly been exposed to or something it has been exposed to many times before. Why some people develop allergic contact dermatitis and some do not is not entirely clear.[1][3]', 'A wide array of substances can cause an allergic reaction, though some of the most common include:[3]', '\nNickel, a substance common in metal alloys used in everyday items such as jewellery, clothes and bra straps\nCobalt, a metal sometimes found in jewellery\nChromate, a metal sometimes found in cement\nCosmetics, such as perfumes, hair dyes and nail varnish\n']","['Treating contact dermatitis will typically involve moisturizers, topical corticosteroids and/or steroid tablets. A dermatologist will be able to advise on the best course of treatment for each person.[5]', 'Moisturizers are often useful in the treatment of dry and scaly skin. A variety of different emollients are available – a dermatologist will be able to offer advice on which type is most suitable.[5]', 'Topical corticosteroids are steroid-containing creams and ointments that are applied directly to the affected skin. They can be effective in treating the redness and pain of dermatitis. Topical corticosteroids are available in a range of strengths, with the appropriate strength dependent on the severity and location of the dermatitis.[5]', 'In severe cases, particularly when the dermatitis covers a large area of skin, steroid tablets may be prescribed.[5] Always follow the instructions provided by the doctor when taking this kind of medication.', 'In mild cases, home remedies such as cool baths or cool, wet compresses may be effective in soothing the symptoms of contact dermatitis.']"
['Conversion Disorder'],"['Conversion disorder is a condition in which people experience symptoms affecting the nervous system that have no physical explanation. This may include symptoms such as:[1]', '\nWeakness\nMovement disorders, such as tremors or twitching\nSensory issues, such as loss of sense of smell or touch\nBlackouts\n', 'Conversion episodes are nearly always triggered by an overwhelmingly stressful event, an emotional issue or a mental health disorder, such as depression. Although there may be no medical or physical cause found to explain symptoms, they are real to the person who is experiencing them.', 'Conversion disorder is relatively common, with women more likely than men to suffer from the condition. Conversion disorder can affect people of any age, but tends to be more common between the ages of 20 and 50.', 'Symptoms of conversion disorder may be worrying to experience but they do not pose any long-term threat to health.

['Coronary Artery Disease'],"['Coronary heart disease is a condition where the arteries which supply the heart become hardened and narrowed over time. This results in a decreased supply of blood and oxygen to the heart muscle (myocardium). This can cause serious complications, such as heart attacks and heart failure. It usually has a slow onset. The main symptom is chest pain or pressure that can radiate to the jaw, shoulder, back or arm. Treatment depends on the severity of symptoms, and involves managing other health conditions, making lifestyle changes, using medications and in some cases undergoing a procedure to widen the blood vessels of the heart. These treatments can help to prevent severe consequences.']","['Symptoms of coronary artery disease include angina (short-lived episodes of chest pain) and shortness of breath. Angina is usually brought on by exercise, and gets better with rest. Some people may experience angina whilst resting. The chest pain is often in the center of the chest, and may spread to the arm and jaw. Some people might also have nausea, a cold sweat, dizziness or fainting spells.']",,"['Treatment depends on the specific symptoms and their severity. For people with mild, predictable chest pain symptoms, treatment involves thinning the blood to prevent blockages, and taking a medication to help open up the blood vessels when there is pain present. As the condition progresses, it might be necessary to have cardiac catheterization (insertion of a tube through the leg blood vessels into the heart blood vessels) to widen narrowed or blocked blood vessels with a stent (a small wire cage). Eventually, some people may need bypass surgery.']"
['Cradle Cap'],"['Cradle cap is a common skin disorder affecting newborn babies, usually those younger than three months of age. It is also known as infant seborrheic dermatitis or infantile seborrheic dermatitis. It is generally not uncomfortable for the infant, except in severe cases when it may be itchy.[1]', 'What causes cradle cap is not entirely certain, but it may be the result of overactive oil-producing sebaceous glands, which are stimulated by the mother’s hormones.[2] These glands produce sebum, an oily or waxy substance that lubricates and waterproofs the skin.', 'Another factor contributing to cradle cap may be the colonization of the sebaceous glands by natural yeasts,[2] specifically particular subspecies of the genus Malassezia[3] It is possible that these yeasts do not cause cradle cap, but rather take advantage of the overproduction of sebum that is already happening.[4]', 'It is also likely that stress, chemical irritants and dry, cold weather may play a role in causing cradle cap.[1] Cradle cap is not caused by allergies, lack of hygiene or lack of care.[1] It is not contagious.[2]', 'Cradle cap can be treated quite easily and will usually clear up within a few weeks or months.[5]']","['Cradle cap usually occurs on the parts of the body that have the highest density of sebaceous glands, such as:[1][2]', '\nThe scalp\nThe face, around the nose, chin and mouth\nThe forehead, the back of the ears or the back of the neck\nIn other skin folds, for example in the armpits, inner elbows and backs of the knees\nThe buttocks and gluteal cleft (the diaper area)\n', 'Cradle cap usually manifests as an oily, flaky crust on the baby’s scalp.

If the infant’s rash itches, feels warm, smells bad or weeps fluids, infection may have occurred,[1] and medical help should be sought.', 'Cradle cap is most common in babies younger than six months of age and often appears within the first few weeks of life. It does not usually persist once the baby is older than nine months of age. In older children, symptoms resembling those of cradle cap may instead suggest:[4]', '\nAtopic dermatitis\nImpetigo\nPsoriasis\nContact dermatitis\nRingworm\n', 'Good to know: Atopic and contact dermatitis, impetigo, psoriasis and ringworm, which are also common skin conditions in babies and young children, can be easily distinguished from cradle cap as they are all itchy. Cradle cap is not usually itchy unless it is very severe.', 'Cradle cap can spread to the diaper area, but diaper rash is a separate condition, which manifests as irritated, tender and red skin. This is caused by the infant’s skin coming into contact with a diaper that is soiled by urine or feces.[6] Babies with diaper rash tend to be irritable because of the discomfort.[7] For more information, see this resource on diaper rash.']",,"['Mild cradle cap can be treated with easily available remedies like petroleum jelly, baby shampoo, almond or olive oil, baby oil and coal tar shampoo. In most cases, monitoring and home remedies suffice. However, if the rash bleeds, weeps fluid, is hot to the touch or spreads extensively, the infant should be taken to the doctor. More severe cases respond well to:[8]', '\nTopical steroids such as hydrocortisone\nAntifungals such as ketoconazole or imidazole.\n', 'One way to treat cradle cap is to warm a small amount of clean, natural oil such as jojoba, almond or olive oil, and massage it into the area affected by cradle cap. After 15 minutes, the flakes can be gently brushed off. The area should then be thoroughly shampooed, with special care taken to ensure that no oil remains on the skin.[2] Flakes can be brushed from the skin by gently using a soft brush or terry cloth towel.', 'Good to know: There is some controversy about the efficacy of olive oil in the treatment of cradle cap. Some studies have shown that olive oil disturbs the natural skin barrier, but others have cast doubt on this.[4]', 'White petroleum jelly can be applied daily and is known to soften scales, which can then be brushed off. Regular washing with baby shampoo is also useful.[3] In some cases, coal tar shampoo may be used, but this can sometimes irritate the skin. The same is true for shampoos devised to control dandruff; as these can sting, they are not very suitable for use on babies.[8]', 'Hydrocortisone, imidazole or ketoconazole are all available as prescription creams or gels for use in the treatment of severe cases of cradle cap.

A high score on this test relating to factors such as an elevated white blood cell count and increased lymph production, may indicate immunosuppressant toxicity, which means that these medications are not suitable for the affected individual.[23]', 'People who are using immunosuppressant medication in the treatment of Crohn’s disease will undergo regular blood tests in order to ensure that the medication continues to agree with them, so that their use can be discontinued if needed, averting the presence of unwanted side effects.Possible side effects of immunosuppressant medication include:', '\nNausea and vomiting\nSusceptibility to infection\nInflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis)\nLiver problems\nAnemia, characterised by feeling tired, breathless and weak\n', 'Biologic therapies', 'Biologic therapies are a type of immunosuppressant medications which use substances, such as antibodies and enzymes, to inhibit the effects of Crohn’s disease.', 'The development of biologic therapies therefore presents a breakthrough alternative treatment option for those who are unwilling or unable to use steroid medication. Historically, people with Crohn’s disease and other types of IBD faced a lack of effective treatment options. Corticosteroid therapy does not alleviate the symptoms of Crohn’s disease in all cases and for those whose symptoms do not respond to it, prolonged systemic corticosteroid therapy and surgery were previously the only options.[24]', 'If a person responds well to biologic therapy, its benefits may include:', '\nRemoval of the need to use steroid medication, thereby avoiding its side effects\nProlonged periods in which the disease is in remission\nPotential delay or negation of the need for surgery to redress intestinal damage caused by Crohn’s disease\n', 'Why is biologic therapy not always offered as a first-line treatment?', 'Medical opinion is divided as to whether biologic therapies should be a first-line treatment option, and many doctors prefer to investigate whether a case of Crohn’s disease can be treated with corticosteroids, a liquid diet or traditional immunosuppressants initially, before considering biologic therapy.', 'The principal reason that some doctors prefer to prescribe traditional treatment methods first is that less is understood about the mechanism of action of biologic medications, and how different people will respond to them. Allergic reactions to the medications used in biologic therapies may occur –immediately or months after stopping treatment – and these can be life-threatening.', 'Methods of administration', 'The two medications used in biologic therapy for Crohn’s disease are Infliximab and Adalimumab.', 'These medications are considered to be broadly comparable in terms of their effectiveness in bringing about prolonged periods of remission and preventing the development of complications, such as intestinal obstructions, which require surgery.[25] Both children and adults can be prescribed Infliximab but Adalimumab is only suitable for adults.', 'Both medications are usually prescribed on a twelve month course. After this, the need to continue will be reviewed, based on the individual’s response and the stability of the periods of remission following dosing.', 'Infliximab is administered as an infusion via a drip into a vein and requires one to visit a hospital to receive the medication as an outpatient procedure.', 'Adalimumab can be administered as an injection and one can learn to do this independently or with the help of another person, meaning that hospital visits are not necessary in order to redose. Doctors will advise on the type of medication that is appropriate in each individual case of Crohn’s disease.', 'Surgery', 'The type of surgical procedure which will be prescribed in this case is called a resection. Doctors will consider performing a resection to remove the inflamed sections of the intestinal tract in cases where the symptoms of Crohn’s disease have not been alleviated by other treatments.', 'A resection is a major procedure and usually performed under general anaesthetic. When the inflamed sections of the intestine have been removed, the healthy sections will be stitched together.', 'Ileostomy (temporary or permanent)', 'An ileostomy is a procedure which involves diverting one’s digestive waste away from the colon in order to give the area, which has undergone a resection, a chance to heal.[26] This can be temporary or permanent.', 'The type of ileostomy prescribed as an adjunct to a resection is usually a loop ileostomy, a temporary version of ileostomy, performed under general anaesthetic, which will be reversed after the body has had a chance to recover from undergoing resection surgery.[27]', 'In a loop ileostomy, an opening in the lower abdominal area, called a stoma, is surgically created. An ileostomy bag, also called a colostomy bag or pouch, is then attached to the small intestine through the stoma. The bag hangs outside the body and collects the waste products that would otherwise have passed into one’s large intestine and out of one’s rectum.[27] Normal function of the digestive system will be restored when the ileostomy is reversed.', 'A loop ileostomy is not always necessary as an accompaniment to a resection. One’s physician will advise on whether the procedure is needed.']"
['Cryptorchidism'],"['Cryptorchidism is also known as undescended testicles (UDT), or undescended testes, and is usually medically defined as a condition in which a testis is not in the scrotum and doesn’t descend into the scrotum by the time the baby is four months old.[1] It is the most common congenital abnormality of the male genitalia[2] and affects about three in every ten male infants born prematurely.[3] Between one and six percent of all male babies are affected. Usually, the condition is unilateral, affecting only one testis. Rarely, the disorder is bilateral, affecting both testes.[1][4] Most cases are idiopathic, which means that the cause is unknown.[5]', 'Cryptorchidism is not painful for the infant, and in eight out of ten cases it resolves without medical intervention. Most cases of cryptorchidism are diagnosed during the routine checks that the baby undergoes at birth. The others are usually diagnosed during infancy, childhood or early adolescence.[4]', 'The development of the testicles', 'The testicles develop in two main phases while in utero. The first phase, which is controlled by male hormones known as androgens, occurs between the eighth and 15th weeks of gestation.[6] During this phase, the testicles develop, but are held in the fetus’s abdominal cavity by a ligament that allows very little movement.[4][6] It is relatively rare for complications to happen during this phase.', 'The second phase takes place between 25 and 35 weeks of gestation, when the testicles begin to migrate towards the scrotum.[7] Most cases of cryptorchidism develop in this phase.[6] However, in the vast majority of infant males, both testicles are present in the scrotal sac at birth.', 'In approximately 80 percent of cases of cryptorchidism, one or both scrotal sacs are empty at birth.[4] In most cases where the testes have not descended by the time the baby is born, they will have descended by the age of three months, due a postnatal surge in testosterone levels. However, if they have not done so by the time the baby is six months old, it is unlikely that they will do so on their own.[1]', 'There are various forms of cryptorchidism:', '\nArrested testicle: one or both testes stay in the inguinal canal (85% of cases), abdomen, or retroperineum.[8]\nEctopic testicle: in which one or both testes descend normally but are diverted to an aberrant position.\nAbsent testicle: in which the testis does not develop.\nAscending testicle: in which the testes are originally in a normal scrotal position, and then “ascend” and become undescended. This can require surgery to correct.\n', 'There is also a special form, known as retractile testes, in which the testes are pulled up out of the scrotum. They can usually be manipulated back into the scrotum. Retractile testes are quite common and no reason for concern. For more information, see section below.', 'Retractile testes', 'In some cases, what appears to be an undescended testicle may in fact be a retractile or ascended testicle. These tend to be more common in older children than they are in infants.', 'A retractile testis occurs when the cremasteric reflex is oversensitive, and generally does not need treatment as the testis is otherwise present and descended. A retracted testis can usually be manipulated back into the scrotum and remain there without being held in place. The condition is usually resolved completely by the time puberty begins.[9] Boys with this condition need to be monitored for ascending testes, but there is usually no cause for concern.', 'In cases where the testicles do not descend into the scrotum of their own accord, medical intervention is necessary to ensure that they do so. Testicles that are not present in the scrotal sac suffer heat stress and may be at higher risk of infertility and developing cancer.[1][10]']",,"['Most cases of cryptorchidism have no obvious cause.', 'Risk factors for cryptorchidism', 'Risk factors for having a male infant with undescended testicles include:[2][6][11][^AB]', '\nPremature birth\nLow birth weight\nA family history of undescended testicles, particularly in a father or brother\nMaternal exposure to chemicals, such as diethystilbestrol, pesticides, brominated flame retardants, phthalates, and dioxins, polyvinyl chloride, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), or bisphenol A (BPA)\nExisting congenital malformations of the urinary system or abdominal wall, such as bladder exstrophy[12], prune-belly syndrome,[13] gastroschisis,[14] or hypospadias\nHereditary syndromes affecting the hypothalamus, connective tissues or nervous system\nConsanguinity of parents\n']","['Undescended testicles must be treated if they have not descended spontaneously by the time the child is six months of age. After that age, they are unlikely to descend on their own. The goal of treatment for undescended testicles is to move viable undescended testes to the correct position in the scrotum and to remove nonviable testicular tissue if it is present.', 'The usual course of treatment is almost always surgery, known as orchidopexy, although in some cases, hormonal treatment may be possible.', 'Orchidopexy', 'In cases where the testicle is palpable, the testis can be repositioned using a procedure known as an orchidopexy. The testicle needs to be palpable for this surgery to be an option.', 'In an orchidopexy, which is usually performed between the ages of six months and 11 years of age, the undescended testicle is brought into the scrotum, along with the vas deferens,[16] testicular blood vessels and spermatic cord. It is then fixed in the scrotum with sutures.[4] This procedure can be done laparoscopically or by open surgery. It is usually done through an incision in the inguinal area,the groin.[1]', 'If the undescended testis is not palpable, exploratory surgery is performed to determine whether the testis is present at all and then, if it is, whether it is viable. This exploratory surgery can be open surgery or laparoscopic surgery.[^AA]', 'If the testis is present and viable, a laparoscopic orchidopexy can be performed. In this case, a laparoscope — a small, slender instrument equipped with a light and a camera — will be used to locate the testis and then guide the procedure to bring it into position. Open surgery is not usually performed in cases where the exact location of the testis is unknown.[1]If the testicle is high in the abdomen, complications may occur because the blood vessels and spermatic cord may not be long enough to allow movement into the scrotum.[17] If it is discovered that no testes are present, or that only one is present, any atrophied testicular tissue that is found will be removed.', 'Orchidopexies should be performed as early as possible to maximize fertility potential in later life and keep the risk of testicular cancer to a minimum. Also, they are easier to do if the child is still physically small, as the distances that the vessels and organs need to be moved are shorter.[4]', 'Surgery in the form of orchidopexy is considered the best and most effective treatment for undescended testicles. There is usually no likelihood of long-term problems following such a procedure.[11]', 'Hormonal treatment', 'Hormonal therapy for undescended testicles is controversial and not widely recommended. It is not generally believed to be very effective, only working in about a fifth of cases.[2]']"
['Cushing’s Syndrome'],"['Cushing’s syndrome is a condition caused by an excess of a steroid hormone called cortisol. This can be caused by taking too much of a medicine which contains cortisol (steroids) or by the body producing too much cortisol. People with Cushing’s syndrome gain weight around their middle and in the face, and develop thin, stretched skin. This condition tends to affect adults between 20 and 50 years of age. The treatment of this condition depends on the cause. Once the underlying cause is recognized and removed, most people with Cushing’s syndrome will recover well. Untreated Cushing’s syndrome can cause osteoporosis, diabetes, high blood pressure and stroke.']","['The typical symptoms include a red, full face (moon face), weight gain around the belly, a hump between the shoulders, skin changes (thinning, stretch marks, easy bruising, increased hair growth) and muscle weakness. Women may become hairier than they previously were. Children may not grow as fast as their peers. Cortisol may affect sexual function and some men may experience erection problems and decreased sexual desire.']",,"['The treatment depends on the cause of the high cortisol level. If it is caused by a high intake of cortisol, the dosage of the medication should be reduced slowly. People taking steroid medications should never stop these medications suddenly. If a growth is the underlying reason, then it may have to be removed by surgery. If it is not safe to remove the cause of the high cortisol levels, cortisol can be blocked by other medications.']"
['Cutaneous Burns'],"['Cutaneous burns, also known as thermal injuries, are one of the most common household injuries, mostly caused by hot liquids or fire. They can be mild or life-threatening emergencies depending on the percentage of the surface of the body which is burned. Treatment depends on the severity of the injury and possible complications. It varies from minor wound care to treatment in a special burn unit, including medications, wound dressings or surgery. The recovery prognosis after small, superficial burns is usually good. The deeper the burn, the more likely it becomes that scarring will occur. Burns which cover large areas of the body are less likely to recover well.']","[""The symptoms and the appearance of a burn both depend on the degree of the burn, which is determined by the depth of the skin affected by the burn. There are three different degrees. First degree, or superficial, burns cause red, swollen and painful skin, which doesn't blister. Second degree burns cause blistering skin and the skin under the blister may be slightly numb. Third degree burns cause the skin to turn black or white, and are usually painless due to nerve damage.""]",,"['Treatment depends on the degree and the extent of the injuries. First of all, the person should be removed from the source of the heat. Small first or second degree burns may be cooled under running water for a few minutes. People who suffer larger, more serious burns should be treated by emergency services and specialist burn units. Emergency treatment involves giving fluids, keeping the person warm and preventing infections. Once the immediate danger has passed, the affected person may receive skin grafts to help the skin grow back and reduce scarring. Complications, such as infections in wounds, are treated with antibiotics if they occur.']"
['Cyclothymic Disorder'],"['Cyclothymic disorder, also known as cyclothymia, is a mental health disorder which affects mood.

['Dental Abscess'],"['An abscess is a pocket of pus that forms within body tissues.[1] Abscesses are the result of an infection, generally bacterial, localized in the area where the abscess forms. They are almost always accompanied by swelling and inflammation. Dental abscesses are abscesses affecting the teeth and adjacent jaw tissue.', 'Each tooth is made up of several layers. The outermost layer is the enamel, which covers a softer layer, the dentin. The dentin and enamel are the tooth’s protective layers. Underneath the dentin is the pulp, where the tooth’s nerves and blood vessels are situated. The pulp runs down the center of the root of the tooth, which connects the tooth to the underlying bone of the upper or lower jaw. Infections in the pulp can therefore easily spread into the bone of the jaw. Likewise, if the gum around the tooth becomes infected, the tooth is at risk of damage as well. Some abscesses affect the pulp first and spread to the bone, while others affect the surrounding tissues of the gum and do not start in the pulp.', 'In abscesses, the presence of plaque[2] and gingivitis[3] are likely to make the situation worse. Antibiotics are sometimes necessary to control the infection.[4] If treated correctly, dental abscesses are not life-threatening. Treatment of dental abscesses is usually carried out by dentists, and often involves taking an antibiotic and root canal treatment. In rare cases, however, the infection can spread, and the condition may become very severe and possibly life-threatening in extremely rare cases.[5]', 'Treatment for dental abscesses involves draining the pus from the tooth and filling or removing the tooth to prevent re-infection.', 'There are two major subtypes of dental abscess: periapical and periodontal.', 'Good to know: A third type, pericoronitis, is much less common. In pericoronitis, the infection affects the gum flap, known as the operculum, which covers a tooth that has not yet erupted through the gum. This article deals with periapical and periodontal abscesses. For more information on pericoronitis, please see the FAQs.', 'Periapical abscesses: affecting the inside of the tooth', 'Periapical abscesses usually occur near the tip of the root of the tooth. They are more common among children than among adults. Children with poor dental hygiene are particularly at risk of periapical abscesses.[5]', 'Poor dental hygiene, including inadequate brushing or flossing, can cause caries, also known as cavities, which erode the enamel and dentin, admitting bacteria to the pulp. As a result of this, the pulp becomes inflamed, and this can lead to the death of nerves in the tooth. Because dead tissue is more vulnerable to infection, this puts the tooth at high risk of an abscess.[1]', 'In periapical abscesses, damage to the enamel and dentin, as in the case of later-stage cavities admits bacteria to the pulp, leading to an inflammatory condition known as pulpitis. Periapical abscesses are a common complication of severe, long-term pulpitis.[6] They can cause swelling in the jaw, cheeks and the floor of the mouth.[2]', 'Periodontal abscesses: affecting the gums', 'Periodontal abscesses are more common among adults than children and are often a complication of gum disease.[1] They tend to originate in the alveolar bone[7] and periodontium.[8] Gum disease or injury can cause teeth to become loose and/or inflamed, including the surrounding area. The resulting pocket that forms between the tissue and the tooth is vulnerable to infection by bacteria which can then form a periodontal abscess.[1]']","['Dental abscesses are usually painful. The pain may be situated in the tooth itself, the surrounding gum or be more generalized, including the jaw, cheeks, or even neck or face, depending on the location of the abscess.[1] The affected tooth may feel tender, loose in the jaw, sensitive to heat and/or cold in the mouth and pressure on the tooth, or to being tapped,[5] and/or may be slightly raised.[6] People with a dental abscess may experience pain in the affected area. If you are concerned that you may have a dental abscess, you can do a free symptom check with the Ada app or find out more about how it works.', 'Other symptoms of dental abscesses include:[1][5]', '\nSwelling in the gums or face\nRedness of the skin over the affected part of the gum\nBleeding in the gums\nSwollen lymph glands in the neck\nGenerally feeling unwell (malaise)\nLoss of appetite or inability to eat\nFever\n', 'Dental examination may also reveal swelling and redness around the tooth in the mouth and a fluctuant (movable/shiftable) mass in the area.[9] Periodontal abscesses may also present with a gum boil. A gum boil, also known as a parulis, is a soft red papule that appears where a sinus or channel from an abscess reaches the outside of the gum, between the gum and the inside of the cheek. It is the result of an abscess, so it is a definite sign that an abscess is present, but it is not itself an abscess.', 'Rarely, in severe cases of dental abscess, the affected person may also experience:[5]', '\nCellulitis, a bacterial infection of skin and subcutaneous tissues\nLockjaw (trismus)\nDifficulty swallowing, due to pain and swelling\nDifficulty breathing, due to swelling\nDifficulty speaking\nDehydration\n', 'Generally, a spreading dental infection as a result of an abscess may cause the affected person to feel very unwell. They may have a fever (a body temperature of 38 C / 100.4 F or higher), swelling in the floor of the mouth, the face or the jaw and severe pain that does not respond to maximum doses of over-the-counter painkillers such as ibuprofen.', 'If any of these symptoms occur, the affected person should seek emergency dental care from a dentist or, if no dental care is available, visit a hospital emergency department or see another doctor as soon as possible. While doctors are not trained to handle dental procedures, they will be able to assist with antibiotics and painkillers to control the infection and pain until dental care is accessed.']","['Dental abscesses are the result of bacterial infection. When the gum tissue surrounding a tooth becomes damaged or the tooth itself is damaged, bacteria that are already in the mouth and, under usual circumstances not harmful, may enter the area and cause infection.', 'One of the most common causes of damage to the teeth and gums is poor dental hygiene, such as inadequate brushing and flossing, high sugar or carbohydrate consumption, and lack of regular checkups at the dentist. These factors may lead to dental caries or cavities, gingivitis and periodontitis, which can admit bacteria to the inside of the tooth or the gum.[10] Maintaining healthy teeth and gums is therefore one of the best ways of reducing the risk of developing dental abscesses, as it removes one of the main causes of abscesses.']","['The usual treatment for a dental abscess is to drain pus as soon as it is possible to do so. This will be done surgically, either by a dentist or a maxillofacial surgeon, a surgeon that has trained as a dentist as well as a doctor and handles complex jaw, tooth and mouth conditions.[5] They may make an incision in the gum or drill a hole in the tooth to allow the pus to drain.[1]', 'Once the pus has drained away, the area will be cleaned. In periapical abscesses, all dead pulpal tissue will be removed to prevent infection recurring.[1] In periodontal abscesses, a very deep cleaning of the teeth and specifically the gum and roots will be done. A root canal may also be necessary if the whole tooth is compromised. If the decay is severe, the tooth may be removed.', 'Root canal treatment', 'Root canal treatment is the standard treatment for the removal of pulpal tissue in cases where the tooth will be retained and not extracted, and it may also be an option in cases where pain is ongoing even after the abscess is resolved.[12]  The person undergoing a root canal will be given a local anesthetic injection to numb the parts of the jaw and mouth affected by the abscess. During the procedure, the dead or infected pulp is removed, the inside of the pulp canals are smoothed, and the pulp is replaced with a filling, often gutta percha.[13] In a few months time, an X-ray and dental checkup will be done to check that the site is healing properly.', 'Pain management and antibiotics', 'As abscesses are painful, people may need acetaminophen or ibuprofen to control the pain. Essential oil of cloves has topical anesthetic properties and can be applied to the painful area, although it is very important to maintain strict hygiene while doing this. Home remedies like the above mentioned oil may provide some pain relief, but will not cure an abscess or prevent further infection.', 'In uncomplicated abscesses, antibiotics may not be necessary.', 'If the infection is severe or has spread, or if the abscess cannot be drained, antibiotics will be prescribed to help bring the infection under control. Antibiotics commonly prescribed for dental abscesses include:[5]', '\nPenicillin\nAmoxicillin, alone or in combination with clavulanate\nAzithromycin\nMetronidazole\nCefoxitin\n', 'If the patient is allergic to amoxicillin and/or penicillin, clindamycin may be prescribed. Penicillin is the usual antibiotic used to treat mild or moderate infections. Because antibiotics alone don’t always penetrate the abscess very well, the abscess may also be surgically drained.[5]', 'Most dental abscesses are straightforward to treat and resolve completely after they are drained.', 'Home treatment of dental abscesses', 'Although essential oil of cloves can be used to manage the pain and sensitivity associated with dental abscesses, it will not cure the abscess. Abscesses will not go away on their own and cannot be treated at home. Untreated abscesses can develop secondary infections and other serious complications that are extremely hazardous to health (see below). It is possible for an untreated abscess to become a medical emergency requiring urgent care from a doctor or dentist. It may also lead to jaw bone loss.', 'Only a qualified medical or dental professional is properly equipped to administer treatment for an abscess safely and effectively.[14] It is strongly advised that people affected by abscesses, or who suspect they may have a dental abscess, seek out the advice of a dentist as soon as they can. It is not safe to try to drain an abscess at home or to leave an abscess untreated.', 'When to seek emergency treatment for dental abscesses', 'Ideally, a person affected by a dental abscess, or who suspects that they may have a dental abscess, should visit the dentist as soon as possible. Because it is not always possible to see a dentist in time, some people may need to be treated for their abscesses in a hospital emergency department. Medical doctors are not specifically trained to handle dental issues, but will be able to stabilize the affected person, providing antibiotics and pain relief, until they can see the dentist.', 'Good to know: Dentists do not form part of the regular staff in most hospital emergency departments. Treatment by a doctor at a hospital will not replace seeing a dentist. Doctors are not trained to deal with dental problems but will be able to assist with managing infection and pain.', 'If a person with an abscess or a suspected abscess shows any of the signs listed below, they should seek urgent medical care as soon as possible.[15][16][17] Danger signs for tooth abscesses include:', '\nAn abscess of more than 1cm in diameter, or which feels large\nSevere swelling or hard lumps on the gums or the face\nBleeding on the gums or in the mouth\nFever or a body temperature of more than 38 C / 101.4 F\nTender lymph nodes in the neck area\n', 'If a person shows the symptoms listed below, they should immediately be seen by a hospital emergency department:[18][19][20]', '\nSevere pain that cannot be controlled with painkillers\nShortness of breath or other difficulty breathing\nDifficulty swallowing due to swelling, or difficulty taking in liquids leading to dehydration\nSevere difficulty opening the mouth\nSwelling of the neck or around the eyes, or severe swelling of the face in general\nSecretions in the mouth they can’t handle due to difficulty swallowing, opening the mouth or others\n']"
['Depression in Childhood or Adolescence'],"['Childhood and adolescent depression is an emotional disorder which affects people under the age of 18. Like depression in adults, it is characterized by persistent feelings of low self-esteem, sadness, and hopelessness and can last for weeks or months. It is more common in the teenage years. Signs of depression in children and adolescents include irritability, loss of interest and social isolation. These signs may be accompanied by physical symptoms such as sleeping difficulties, digestive problems, changes in appetite, and fatigue. Successful treatment typically involves psychological counseling and medication. With treatment and support, many people recover from depression. Untreated depression in children and teenagers may have lifelong consequences.']","['Symptoms of depression vary with age. Small children may express depression by uncontrollable crying or reluctance to eat or play. They may develop slower than other children and seem less interactive than other children. School-aged children appear impulsive, easily frustrated and sometimes have social and learning difficulties. They may develop self-harming behavior. Symptoms in teenagers can sometimes be difficult to recognize, but include a persistently low mood, and a lack of energy and motivation. They may experience or describe feelings of inner emptiness, insecurity, and trouble concentrating. Teenagers also experience physical symptoms, such as difficulty sleeping, stomach pain, a loss of appetite, weight loss or gain and headaches. Their school performance may gradually get worse. Less commonly, some teenagers may develop thoughts of death or suicide.']",,"['The treatment of depression in children and teenagers is guided by the severity of the symptoms and the circumstances of the child and their family. Treatment commonly involves psychotherapy (counseling) and sometimes medication. Counseling often involves the family, and is typically focussed on helping a young person learn to recognize and control their thoughts and feelings, and on teaching them healthy coping skills. Treatment is slow and steady, and it may take weeks to months until improvement is seen.']"
['Depressive Episode'],"['The definition of a depressive episode is a period of depression that persists for at least two weeks.[1] During a depressive episode, a person will typically experience low or depressed mood and/or loss of interest in most activities, as well as a number of other symptoms of depression, such as tiredness, changes in appetite, feelings of worthlessness and recurrent thoughts of death. The length of a depressive episode varies, but the average duration is thought to be six to eight months.[2]', 'Depression is a common illness, and many people will experience one or more episodes of depression in their lifetime.

The word ectopic means ‘out of place’. In about 95 percent of cases, the fertilized ovum, also known as an egg, implants in one of the fallopian tubes. This is often due to scarring from previous infection or other abnormalities in the pelvic area, but it can also happen without a clear cause.', 'The symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy include vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain and absence of menstruation. However, some people experience symptoms that are similar to those found in gastroenteritis, also known as stomach flu, and miscarriage.[1] Ectopic pregnancy may also be asymptomatic.', 'While most people make a good recovery from an ectopic pregnancy, the condition can be life -threatening if left untreated. An ectopic pregnancy cannot be moved to the uterus to grow normally and almost never survives until birth. It may pass out of the cervix on its own, though medical or surgical intervention is normally required.

Usually, the fertilized egg passes along the fallopian tube and into the uterus and implants into the lining of the uterus, known as the endometrium,  where it will grow and develop.', 'Ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized egg implants and starts to grow outside the uterus, usually in a fallopian tube. This is often due to scarring from previous infections or other abnormalities in the tube’s shape, for instance a birth defect.', 'As the ectopic pregnancy gets bigger, it can run out of space to grow and rupture the fallopian tube, causing severe pain and internal bleeding.

However, if a person does conceive, the probability of the pregnancy being ectopic is higher than in women not using an IUD.[3] An IUD is still more protective against ectopic pregnancy than not using contraception.', 'Smoking tobacco: This can hinder the transfer of the ovum to the uterus by decreasing the ability of the muscles in the fallopian tube walls to contract.', 'In-utero diethylstilbestrol (DES) exposure: Exposure before birth to DES, a synthetic form of the female hormone estrogen that was prescribed to pregnant women from the 1940s to 1970s to prevent pregnancy complications, has been found to increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy by about four times.[6]', 'Types of ectopic pregnancy', 'The kind of ectopic pregnancy a person has depends on where the fertilized egg implants.', 'Fallopian pregnancy', 'Also known as tubal pregnancy, a fallopian ectopic pregnancy can be further divided into three sub-types:', '\nAmpullary (in the middle part of the fallopian tube), accounting for 80% of ectopic pregnancies\nIsthmic (in the upper part of the fallopian tube close to the uterus), accounting for 12% of ectopic pregnancies\nFimbrial (at the end of the tube),  accounting for 5% of ectopic pregnancies\n', 'The tube has a delicate structure made up of cilia, which are tiny hair-like projections, and mucus-producing cells, which work together to propel an ovum, fertilized in the fallopian tube, to the uterus to implant, over the space of about four days.', 'Sometimes, the transportation of the developing embryo is slow, perhaps for reasons of inflammation or infection of the fallopian tube or for no obvious reason. In such cases, it can implant in the fallopian tube.', 'About 95 percent of ectopic pregnancies occur in the fallopian tube.', 'Other types of ectopic pregnancy', 'There are other types of ectopic pregnancies, all of which are rare. These include:[7]', 'Interstitial pregnancy: This occurs in the part of the fallopian tube embedded in the uterus wall. It is typically hard to diagnose and can therefore be particularly dangerous, as it may progress further and rupture later, damaging both the fallopian tube and the uterus wall.', 'Cervical ectopic pregnancy: Pregnancy in the cervix – the passage between the womb and vagina – is one of the rarest forms of ectopic pregnancy and carries a risk of life-threatening vaginal hemorrhage. This is due to the possibility of heavy bleeding when the ectopic pregnancy tissue separates from the cervix, which contains many blood vessels.', 'Ovarian ectopic pregnancy: This is typically difficult to diagnose, as it can appear very similar to a tubal ectopic pregnancy that is stuck to the ovary. It is usually not diagnosed until surgery, when partial or complete removal of the ovary will usually be necessary.', 'Cesarean scar ectopic pregnancies: This occurs when a fertilized egg implants into the scar from a cesarean section. The pregnancy can grow out of the uterus or into the cervix, which can lead to massive internal or vaginal bleeding. In some cases, the fetus may be able to survive until birth, but with the risk of significant maternal bleeding and removal of the womb, known as hysterectomy, at delivery.', 'Intramural pregnancy: This is a difficult-to-diagnose pregnancy that implants outside of the womb cavity, but within its muscular wall. It may occur if the uterus is scarred from surgery or if a condition called adenomyosis is present, in which the inner lining of the uterus breaks through the muscle wall of the uterus.', 'Abdominal pregnancy: Pregnancies in the abdomen are thought to start as tubal pregnancies, before separating from the wall of the fallopian tube and passing into the abdominal cavity, where they reattach.

For more information, see the resource about signs of miscarriage.', 'Ultrasound', 'Ultrasound is an imaging technique which uses soundwaves to create an image of the developing pregnancy. It is a painless and non-invasive procedure which can be performed in two different ways:[8]', '\nTransvaginally: A scanning probe is inserted into the vagina.\nTransabdominally: Gel is spread onto the skin of the lower abdomen, and the scanner is passed over the area.\n', 'In diagnosing an ectopic pregnancy, doctors will look for where the pregnancy is located in the ultrasound images. These can help them determine whether the person’s symptoms are being caused by an ectopic pregnancy, a healthy pregnancy or another condition. Ultrasound indicators for ectopic pregnancy include:[9]', 'No pregnancy in the uterus, or a gestation sac in the uterus missing an embryo: This is a pregnancy of unknown location (PUL). This is a label given until the pregnancy location can be found, and a diagnosis can be given. Many of these will not be ectopic and will not need treatment.', 'No pregnancy in the uterus and a possible mass in the area of a fallopian tube: This would likely lead to diagnosis of a possible ectopic pregnancy.', 'hCG test for ectopic pregnancy', 'Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a hormone produced by the placenta, an organ that develops in the womb during pregnancy. A beta hCG blood test can detect hCG in the blood approximately 11 days after conception and establish the precise amount of hCG present. This might be used if a person has been pregnant for six weeks, but an ultrasound scan does not show a developing pregnancy in the uterus. The test may be repeated at intervals to measure changes in hCG levels.[10]', 'Possible indicators for ectopic pregnancy from a beta hCG blood test include:[11]', '\nDeclining hCG levels: This can be an indicator that the ectopic pregnancy has ended and is self-resolving or will be miscarried in the coming days or weeks.\nSlow rising hCG levels: If the levels rise more slowly than in a normal pregnancy, it is likely that the pregnancy is ectopic.\n', 'In a healthy pregnancy, hCG levels in the blood double about every two to four days throughout the first trimester, reaching their peak after 8-11 weeks and then decreasing before plateauing during the second trimester.', 'Laparoscopic diagnosis', 'Rarely, laparoscopy, a type of keyhole surgery, is used to confirm the diagnosis, if hCG and ultrasound results are ambiguous. Under general anesthetic, a laparoscope, a narrow instrument with a camera and light on the end, is inserted through a small cut, usually into the belly button, to look at the pelvis. If an ectopic pregnancy is found, treatment to remove it may take place during the same operation.[3]', 'Treatment', 'An ectopic pregnancy can be life threatening if left untreated and normally requires medical or surgical intervention to remove it. However, in some cases, when it is diagnosed early, ectopic pregnancy may be monitored to see if it will resolve on its own.', 'Treatment options depend on:[12]', '\nHCG levels\nHow many weeks pregnant the affected person is\nSize and impact of the ectopic pregnancy as shown on an ultrasound\nPain levels\nGeneral health\nThe options the hospital has available\nPersonal views and preferences, such as future pregnancy plans\n', 'Expectant management', 'Also known as conservative or wait-and-see management, expectant management involves waiting to see if the ectopic pregnancy tissue passes out of the cervix on its own, instead of undergoing immediate treatment.', 'Expectant management is only offered as an option in some cases of very early diagnosis. Candidates for expectant management of ectopic pregnancy should:[13]', '\nBe asymptomatic\nShow signs that the ectopic pregnancy is resolving, such as declining beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-HCG) levels\nNot show signs of rupture\nNot show signs of hemodynamic instability (abnormal blood pressure)\nHave easy access to a hospital and be prepared to continue with follow-up\nBe willing to accept the potential risks of tubal rupture\n', 'The approach involves close monitoring by medical professionals through repeated blood tests to check that hCG levels are dropping. It can take a few weeks or sometimes months for this to happen. About half of ectopic pregnancies may resolve on their own where there is a drop in hCG levels.', 'If a person develops new symptoms, another ultrasound scan may be done, and treatment options will be reassessed. Medical or surgical intervention may be required if it does not complete as planned.[14]', 'Medical management with methotrexate for ectopic pregnancy', 'Sometimes, an ectopic pregnancy may be treated with a medication called methotrexate. This stops the growth of the embryo and typically allows surgery to be avoided. Medical management may be suitable if a diagnosis has been made very early.', 'Treatment with methotrexate is an especially attractive option if the pregnancy is located in the cervix or ovary or in the interstitial or the cornual portion of the tube. Surgical treatment in these cases is often associated with an increased risk of hemorrhage.', 'Methotrexate is administered as an injection, usually a single shot into the buttock muscle. After the injection, there may be an overnight stay in hospital, and regular follow-up visits will be needed for a few weeks to monitor hCG levels until they return to normal. Some people will need a second injection of methotrexate. Very occasionally, surgery will still be required.', 'Some pain is likely in the first few days after the injection, but this can usually be controlled with paracetamol. Certain substances should be avoided during treatment, including:[3]', '\nNonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), e.g., ibuprofen or naprosyn, as they can interact with methotrexate and reduce its effectiveness\nAlcoholic beverages, as the liver will be working hard to metabolise methotrexate\nSupplements containing folic acid, as this can interact with methotrexate, preventing it from achieving the desired effect\n', 'Good to know: Apart from being used as a medication for ectopic pregnancy, methotrexate is a chemotherapy drug and immune system suppressant used to treat a variety of other conditions. It can cause significant side-effects. However, the dose to treat ectopic pregnancy is much lower and is unlikely to cause severe problems.[12]', 'Ectopic pregnancy removal with surgery', 'There are two possible aims for surgical management, which will be decided depending on damage to the affected fallopian tube and the condition of the other tube. These are:[12][13]', 'Total salpingectomy: This involves removal of the tube containing the ectopic pregnancy and is normally recommended for people who either do not want to have any children in future, who have had another ectopic pregnancy in the same fallopian tube, or who have severely damaged tubes. This reduces the risk of a persistent ectopic pregnancy, in which some ectopic cells are left behind and continue to grow, or further ectopic pregnancies. Total salpingectomy may also be chosen in cases of uncontrolled bleeding and abnormal blood pressure.', 'Linear salpingostomy: This is a more conservative approach, involving a surgical incision into a fallopian tube, which aims to remove the ectopic pregnancy without removing the tube. This is normally recommended for people who have an unruptured ectopic pregnancy in the ampullary (middle) portion of the tube. This may also be chosen if the person only has one tube, or their other tube does not seem to be healthy. It carries a higher risk of future ectopic pregnancy and persistent ectopic pregnancy, but still leaves the possibility of a future uterine pregnancy. However, salpingostomy is not always possible.', 'The operation will be performed under general anesthetic in one of two ways:', 'Laparoscopy: This is keyhole surgery involving minimal incisions. Recovery is about two to four weeks, though this varies from person to person.', 'Laparotomy: This is open surgery, which is used if severe internal bleeding is suspected.

Some ectopic pregnancies will resolve before they produce symptoms.', 'Q: Can a person have an ectopic pregnancy with a copper coil (IUD)?\nA: IUDs ensure a very low risk of any pregnancy, either intrauterine or ectopic. However, if a person does conceive, the probability of the pregnancy being ectopic is higher than in women not using an IUD.[3] An IUD is still more protective against ectopic pregnancy than not using contraception.[16]', 'Q: Can a person have an ectopic pregnancy with IVF?\nA: Yes, in vitro fertilization puts a person at higher risk of ectopic pregnancy. It may increase the occurrence of unusual types of ectopic pregnancies, such as heterotopic pregnancy, in which there is simultaneous intrauterine and tubal pregnancies, and interstitial pregnancy, which occurs in the part of the fallopian tube embedded in the uterus wall.[17]', 'Q: Is it possible to miscarry an ectopic pregnancy?\nA: In the very early stages, the fetus may pass out of the cervix on its own, without the need for further treatment. This may result in some symptoms of miscarriage being present. As the fetus develops, it becomes less likely that it will pass out of the womb on its own, and medical or surgical management will be needed to remove it. However, the techniques used to treat ectopic pregnancy may differ from those used to treat incomplete miscarriage. See this resource on miscarriage for more information.', 'Q: Is prevention of ectopic pregnancy possible?\nA: Preventing ectopic pregnancy is not normally possible. Adequate use of contraceptives significantly reduces the risk of ectopic pregnancy. A person may be able to prevent a tubal pregnancy in the fallopian tube, if things that scar the tube, such as smoking and exposure to sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), can be avoided.', 'In some cases of ectopic pregnancy, a person may have surgery to remove the tube containing the ectopic pregnancy, which will reduce the risk of further ectopic pregnancies or  persistent ectopic pregnancy.

However, in some cases, when it is diagnosed early, ectopic pregnancy may be monitored to see if it will resolve on its own.', 'Treatment options depend on:[12]', '\nHCG levels\nHow many weeks pregnant the affected person is\nSize and impact of the ectopic pregnancy as shown on an ultrasound\nPain levels\nGeneral health\nThe options the hospital has available\nPersonal views and preferences, such as future pregnancy plans\n', 'Expectant management', 'Also known as conservative or wait-and-see management, expectant management involves waiting to see if the ectopic pregnancy tissue passes out of the cervix on its own, instead of undergoing immediate treatment.', 'Expectant management is only offered as an option in some cases of very early diagnosis. Candidates for expectant management of ectopic pregnancy should:[13]', '\nBe asymptomatic\nShow signs that the ectopic pregnancy is resolving, such as declining beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-HCG) levels\nNot show signs of rupture\nNot show signs of hemodynamic instability (abnormal blood pressure)\nHave easy access to a hospital and be prepared to continue with follow-up\nBe willing to accept the potential risks of tubal rupture\n', 'The approach involves close monitoring by medical professionals through repeated blood tests to check that hCG levels are dropping. It can take a few weeks or sometimes months for this to happen. About half of ectopic pregnancies may resolve on their own where there is a drop in hCG levels.', 'If a person develops new symptoms, another ultrasound scan may be done, and treatment options will be reassessed. Medical or surgical intervention may be required if it does not complete as planned.[14]', 'Medical management with methotrexate for ectopic pregnancy', 'Sometimes, an ectopic pregnancy may be treated with a medication called methotrexate. This stops the growth of the embryo and typically allows surgery to be avoided. Medical management may be suitable if a diagnosis has been made very early.', 'Treatment with methotrexate is an especially attractive option if the pregnancy is located in the cervix or ovary or in the interstitial or the cornual portion of the tube. Surgical treatment in these cases is often associated with an increased risk of hemorrhage.', 'Methotrexate is administered as an injection, usually a single shot into the buttock muscle. After the injection, there may be an overnight stay in hospital, and regular follow-up visits will be needed for a few weeks to monitor hCG levels until they return to normal. Some people will need a second injection of methotrexate. Very occasionally, surgery will still be required.', 'Some pain is likely in the first few days after the injection, but this can usually be controlled with paracetamol. Certain substances should be avoided during treatment, including:[3]', '\nNonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), e.g., ibuprofen or naprosyn, as they can interact with methotrexate and reduce its effectiveness\nAlcoholic beverages, as the liver will be working hard to metabolise methotrexate\nSupplements containing folic acid, as this can interact with methotrexate, preventing it from achieving the desired effect\n', 'Good to know: Apart from being used as a medication for ectopic pregnancy, methotrexate is a chemotherapy drug and immune system suppressant used to treat a variety of other conditions. It can cause significant side-effects. However, the dose to treat ectopic pregnancy is much lower and is unlikely to cause severe problems.[12]', 'Ectopic pregnancy removal with surgery', 'There are two possible aims for surgical management, which will be decided depending on damage to the affected fallopian tube and the condition of the other tube. These are:[12][13]', 'Total salpingectomy: This involves removal of the tube containing the ectopic pregnancy and is normally recommended for people who either do not want to have any children in future, who have had another ectopic pregnancy in the same fallopian tube, or who have severely damaged tubes. This reduces the risk of a persistent ectopic pregnancy, in which some ectopic cells are left behind and continue to grow, or further ectopic pregnancies. Total salpingectomy may also be chosen in cases of uncontrolled bleeding and abnormal blood pressure.', 'Linear salpingostomy: This is a more conservative approach, involving a surgical incision into a fallopian tube, which aims to remove the ectopic pregnancy without removing the tube. This is normally recommended for people who have an unruptured ectopic pregnancy in the ampullary (middle) portion of the tube. This may also be chosen if the person only has one tube, or their other tube does not seem to be healthy. It carries a higher risk of future ectopic pregnancy and persistent ectopic pregnancy, but still leaves the possibility of a future uterine pregnancy. However, salpingostomy is not always possible.', 'The operation will be performed under general anesthetic in one of two ways:', 'Laparoscopy: This is keyhole surgery involving minimal incisions. Recovery is about two to four weeks, though this varies from person to person.', 'Laparotomy: This is open surgery, which is used if severe internal bleeding is suspected. It involves a larger incision in the lower abdomen. Recovery is about four to six weeks, though this varies from person to person.']"
['Electrocardiogram'],"['An electrocardiogram, also known as an ECG or EKG, is a simple, painless procedure used to test and record the heart’s rhythm and electrical activity. During the procedure, small electrodes are attached to the skin, through which the heart’s electrical pulses can be monitored.', 'An electrocardiogram can be ordered by a heart specialist, also called a cardiologist, or a normal doctor to check for a variety of heart conditions, including heart attacks and arrhythmia, an irregular heartbeat. The procedure may be carried out at a doctor’s office or hospital and comes with no serious risks.[1]', 'Reasons for needing an electrocardiogram', 'An electrocardiogram is typically used in conjunction with other tests in order to diagnose or monitor various heart conditions.', 'People experiencing chest pain (angina), heart palpitations, shortness of breath or other symptoms may be given an electrocardiogram in order to investigate the underlying causes of the problems.', 'The procedure is able to detect conditions including:[2]', '\nAtrial fibrillation: A condition that often causes irregular heartbeats\nTachycardia: When the heart beats faster than normal, especially while resting\nHeart attacks (myocardial infarction): When the tissue of the heart muscle starts to die due to a sudden, significant reduction in the supply of oxygen-rich blood, most often caused by coronary heart disease[3][4]\nCoronary heart disease: When the flow of blood to the heart is blocked by a buildup of plaque, a waxy material made up of fats, cholesterol, calcium and other substances, inside the blood vessels[5][6]\nCardiomyopathy: A thickening or enlargement of the walls of the heart\n', 'An electrocardiogram may also be used to monitor the progress of a certain condition or to see how medication is affecting the heart.', 'A normal reading from an electrocardiogram does not completely rule out heart problems, as conditions that come and go may not be detected by the test.[7] To overcome this problem, a portable ECG machine, called a Holter monitor, may be used. This device is worn continuously over 24 or 48 hours in order to monitor the heart as an individual goes about their daily life.[8]', 'Types of electrocardiogram', 'There are three main types of electrocardiogram, of which one is selected depending on what kind of condition is being diagnosed or monitored.[9]', '\nRest ECG: The most common type, carried out while the testee is lying down in a horizontal position\nExercise or stress ECG: Carried out while the testee is using a treadmill or exercise bike\nAmbulatory ECG: A portable machine is used, allowing the test to be performed from home\n', 'How is an electrocardiogram carried out?', 'An electrocardiogram will usually be carried out in a hospital or doctor’s office. First, the testee will be asked to change into a hospital gown or to remove the clothes on their torso. Next, they will be asked to lie down on their back on a hospital bed.', 'Electrodes, usually 10 or 12, will be fixed to the torso and sometimes to the limbs. The electrodes are relatively small, sticky and attached to the electrocardiogram machine through wires. To secure the electrodes, hair on certain parts of the body may be shaved.', 'During the test – which will usually only takes a few minutes – the testee will be asked to breathe normally and avoid excessive movement or talking, as this may distort the results. The electrodes will monitor the electrical pulses of the heart, which are then recorded and printed as waves on a piece of paper.[10]', 'The procedure will be slightly different in the case of an exercise or ambulatory ECG.', 'Electrocardiogram results', 'The results from an electrocardiogram will generally be displayed electronically or printed on paper. After they have been compiled, the results will typically be analyzed by a doctor or specialist before being shared. This may happen on the same day, or a person may be required to return to the hospital or doctor’s office at a later date.', 'Results from a healthy patient will usually show a consistent rhythm from the heart and a heart rate of between 60 and 100 beats per minute.[11]', 'Risks associated with an electrocardiogram', 'An electrocardiogram is a very safe and painless procedure which is considered routine by healthcare providers. There is a slight risk of pain when the electrodes are removed and of a mild rash in the areas where they were applied.[12]', '', '\n\nNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. “Electrocardiogram.” December 9, 2016.

The treating doctor can give the best advice as to treatment.']"
['Endometrial Polyps'],"['Endometrial polyps, also called uterine polyps, are growths in the interior of the uterus or womb, formed of an overgrowth of the cells (endometrium) that line this cavity. They may occur alone or in clusters and are typically less than a centimeter in diameter, but in rare cases can grow much larger – for example, to the size of a golf ball or an orange.[1][2]', 'Symptoms in adults, both pre and postmenopausal, commonly include unusual bleeding. Polyps are more common in people who have not yet experienced menopause than those who have. This may be because endometrial polyps seem to be reactive to estrogen levels.

Most endometrial polyps are small, and many people who experience them will never develop symptoms. Pain is not a typical symptom of uterine polyps.[3]', 'People experiencing possible symptoms of endometrial polyps should seek medical attention. In addtion, the free Ada app can be used to carry out a symptom assessment.']","['Endometrial polyps are caused by the overgrowth of endometrial tissue, which is the lining of the uterus that swells and then shrinks during the menstrual cycle. Endometrial polyps are estrogen-sensitive, with hormones in the bloodstream playing a role in their occurrence.[2][4]']","['Small, asymptomatic polyps in people before menopause often require no treatment, but will instead be monitored for changes or an increase in symptoms.[2]', 'A short-term option to address the symptoms of endometrial polyps is the use of hormonal treatments, such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists and progestins. However, since symptoms usually recur once treatment is stopped, this is not the preferred long-term treatment option.[2]', 'Uterine polyp removal, called a polypectomy, which is carried out using a hysteroscopy, is the standard procedure. The doctor uses a camera attached to a long, thin tube to examine the interior of the uterus, locate the polyp and then remove it with an integrated wire loop or blade. It is typically screened for cancer.[3]', 'The removal of small endometrial polyps using hysteroscopy can sometimes be done as an outpatient procedure at a doctor’s office, but removing large polyps may require a hospital stay. Many people are able to return to normal activities within the next few days. Side-effects of uterine polyp removal may include light spotting.[3]']"
['Endometriosis'],"['Endometriosis is a condition in which the tissue that usually lines the inside of the uterus (endometrium) is found in the abdomen (belly) or in other organs. It is mostly found in the pelvis or abdomen (belly). It is most common in women aged between 25 and 35. The most common symptoms are painful periods with heavy or irregular bleeding. Although there is no cure for endometriosis, treatments are usually very helpful in reducing symptoms.']","['Symptoms occur during the menstrual period, when the patches of abnormal tissue begin to bleed. The typical symptoms are very painful periods and heavy or irregular menstrual bleeding. People with endometriosis also have pain in the abdomen or lower back, pain when urinating or opening the bowels, pain during sexual intercourse, bloating, nausea and vomiting.']",,"['There is no cure for endometriosis, so treatment involves controlling the symptoms. Simple pain medication, such as paracetamol, may help with period pain. Other treatments include hormone medications, which help to stabilize hormone levels and reduce the amount of menstrual bleeding, or medications that stop menstruation from occurring.

Another cause is urinary retention, caused by an enlarged prostate, bladder or kidney stones, causing a urinary tract infection that then spreads to the prostate.', 'Factors that put individuals at risk of prostatitis, other than UTIs, include prostate surgery or any complications of prostate surgery, catheterisation (using a thin, flexible tube called a catheter to drain urine from the bladder, e.g. when healing after surgery), and infections spreading from other parts of the body. For prostatitis to be considered chronic, symptoms have to recur for at least three months. Recurrence is possible because the prostate can harbor infection. Symptoms can come and go. Chronic prostatitis tends not to cause fevers.', 'Acute prostatitis is caused by infection and manifests with chills, fever and muscle pain, in addition to the multitude of urinary symptoms mentioned above, often along with cloudy-appearing urine. It often causes intense/severe abdominal and/or pelvic pain. It is relatively rare compared to chronic prostatitis, but must be treated promptly.

['Essential Hypertension'],"['Essential hypertension is a type of high blood pressure that has no clearly identifiable cause, but is thought to be linked to genetics, poor diet, lack of exercise and obesity. It is by far the most common form of high blood pressure, affecting the majority of those who experience hypertension. It is also known as primary hypertension.[1]', 'As the heart pumps blood through the circulatory system, blood presses against the artery walls. High blood pressure occurs when the walls of the arteries exert a stronger oppositional force, which requires the heart to work harder in order to move blood through the body. This results in an increase in the pressure of blood in the arteries.[2]', 'There are a variety of methods for managing essential hypertension, including lifestyle changes and medication. If left untreated, the condition can lead to serious complications, including heart attack and heart failure. People concerned that they may have essential hypertension can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.', 'Secondary hypertension', 'Whereas essential hypertension is characterized by its lack of identifiable causes, secondary hypertension, another form of hypertension, is directly linked to a variety of vascular, endocrine (related to hormones), heart and kidney conditions. It is far less common than essential hypertension.[3]']","['In most cases, there will be no apparent symptoms of essential hypertension, and it will only be discovered during a regular medical examination. If essential hypertension is not diagnosed, the condition has the potential to worsen and create heart or kidney problems.', 'Sometimes, people with essential hypertension may experience headaches, dizziness and blurred vision, but these symptoms are unlikely to occur until blood pressure reaches very high levels. Some people report that their heartbeat seems louder than usual and feels as if it is inside the ear; this may be more prominent the higher the blood pressure is.[4] People experiencing symptoms that may be linked to hypertension can use the free Ada app for a symptom assessment.', 'If a person experiences vomiting or nausea, severe headaches, vision changes or nosebleeds, it may be a sign of malignant hypertension – a much more dangerous type of high blood pressure.[5] If these symptoms appear, urgent medical attention should be sought.']","['Essential hypertension is defined by its lack of identifiable causes. However, certain risk factors that make the condition more likely have been identified.

['Fabry Disease'],"['Fabry disease is a rare genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A – also known as alpha-GAL. Alpha-GAL breaks down a fat called globotriaosylceramide (GL-3 or Gb3), which is normally produced inside healthy cells.', 'A lack of alpha-GAL causes this substance to build up inside the cell and disturb normal cell function, causing symptoms.[1] Fabry disease is one of a number of hereditary conditions known as lysosomal storage disorders, all of which cause problems with normal cell function.[2]', 'Fabry disease is very rare, and it is roughly estimated that it affects between 1 in 17,000 and 1 in 117,000 people.

Start your free symptom assessment in the Ada app.']","['Fabry disease is caused by a genetic mutation. It is an X-linked disorder, meaning that the condition only affects the X-chromosome. As females have two X-chromosomes and males just one, males stand a far higher chance of inheriting the condition from a parent, because a second  X-chromosome offers some – but not total – protection against the mutation.[4]', 'The children of females with Fabry disease, both male and female, stand a 50 percent chance of inheriting the disorder. Female children of males with Fabry disease will always inherit the disorder, though they may not always display symptoms. Male children of males with the condition will not inherit Fabry disease.', 'The genetic defect leads to a lack of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A that in turn leads to a buildup of globotriaosylceramide, a type of fat that is normally broken down as part of healthy cell function. The severity of the disorder depends on how much alpha-galactosidase the body produces. In some, this can be none at all, while in others the enzyme is present but in insufficient quantities.[5]']","['There is no cure for Fabry disease so treatment is centered on managing the symptoms of the disorder. This can be combined with enzyme replacement therapy, which has demonstrated some success in combating the enzyme deficiency and should be started as soon as a diagnosis is made.[7]', 'Enzyme replacement therapy', 'Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is aimed at reversing the abnormalities in the cells of those with Fabry disease, thereby easing the symptoms of the condition.[8] Only in use since 2001, ERT is a relatively new treatment method for people with Fabry disease. Two medications are available for this treatment, Replagal and Fabrazyme, both of which are given through a drip into the veins. ERT has been shown to improve symptoms, as well as reducing the risk of kidney problems, stroke, and\nhearing loss.[8]', 'Although enzyme-replacement therapy aims to treat the cause of Fabry disease, additional treatments might be needed to reduce symptoms and prevent complications.', 'Pain', 'To combat pain, doctors will generally prescribe pain relief medication such as gabapentin, carbamazepine, phenytoin and opioids. The latter are generally reserved for particularly severe pain.', 'Skin rash', 'The skin rash associated with Fabry disease does not generally cause discomfort but can in some cases bleed. Cosmetic treatments such as laser therapy may be used to remove or lessen the rash.', 'Hearing loss', 'Individuals experiencing hearing loss can be fitted with a hearing aid.', 'Gastrointestinal problems', 'Gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting and nausea are often managed with medications. Doctors may also advise people experiencing gastrointestinal problems to avoid any foods that trigger symptoms and to maintain a low-fat diet.']"

If a child dramatically falls from one percentile to another, from the 70th percentile to the 30th, for example, this may also be diagnosed as failure to thrive, even if their weight is not significantly low.[1]', 'The causes of failure to thrive are often complex, with medical disorders, as well as environmental and social factors, all playing a role. There is no specific treatment for the condition. Instead, the underlying causes will be considered and doctors and other medical professionals will outline a management plan based on this.', 'Although failure to thrive is most common in babies and children, it can also occur in elderly people, with symptoms including weight loss, frailty and loss of appetite. Management, as with children, typically involves addressing the underlying set of causes.']","['The symptoms experienced as a result of failure to thrive depend on the severity and the underlying cause or causes of the condition.

If the condition is the result of an underlying medical disorder, treatment will be aimed at remedying or managing this condition.', 'If social and environmental factors are the cause, parental counseling and support may be recommended. The aim of this is to educate the parents about proper nutrition and to help find solutions to any financial and/or emotional issues that may be present. A meal plan may also be devised for the child to ensure that they receive the calories and nutrition needed.', 'In cases of severe failure to thrive, a child may be admitted to hospital where a team of doctors, pediatricians, nutritionists and social workers, among other professionals, will work together to formulate an appropriate treatment plan.']"

This mutation disrupts the body’s ability to remove low-density lipoprotein from the blood as it normally would, resulting in the development of high levels of cholesterol.', 'The condition is autosomal dominant, meaning the gene mutation can be inherited if only one parent is a carrier. In these instances, the condition is known as heterozygous FH. In the rare case where both parents are carriers, a particularly severe variety of familial hypercholesterolemia known as homozygous FH will be passed on.', 'The condition is differentiated from standard hypercholesterolemia by its hereditary nature. Anyone can develop hypercholesterolemia – which is generally caused by unhealthy lifestyle choices – whereas only those with a family history of the condition can develop familial hypercholesterolemia.

['Folate Deficiency'],"['Folate is also known as Vitamin B9. It is one of a group of important vitamins involved in cell metabolism. Folate plays a critical role in the synthesis of DNA, RNA and proteins. Deficiency can therefore cause impairment of cell division and an accumulation of possibly toxic metabolites, e.g. homocysteine. Along with Vitamin B12, folate is important for regulating the manufacture of red blood cells.[1]', 'The synthetic form of folate is folic acid, which converts to folate in the body. Because folic acid is more easily absorbed by the body, it is the form most commonly used in supplements and fortified foods.', 'Many plants, particularly green leafy vegetables, and animal products contain folate. Thus, most healthy people absorb sufficient folate from their diets to avoid deficiency, but in some cases the body may increase demand. If supplementation doesn’t occur, this may lead to deficiency.', 'Folate deficiency is most commonly found in pregnant and lactating women, people with chronic conditions of the gastrointestinal tract, people following restricted diets due to weight-loss regimes or medical conditions, people with alcohol dependence and people more than 65 years of age.[2]', 'Folate deficiency will not go away on its own. Treatment is required and may involve dietary changes and/or oral supplements and treatment of underlying causes, if any are present. If left untreated, folate deficiency may result in folate deficiency anemia, which can cause severe complications.[3]']","['Common symptoms of folate deficiency can include:[2][4]', '\nTiredness, fatigue and lethargy\nMuscle weakness\nNeurological signs, such as a feeling of pins and needles, tingling, or burning, or peripheral neuropathy, i.e. a numbness in the extremities\nPsychological problems, such as depression, confusion, memory problems, problems of judgement and understanding\nGastrointestinal signs, such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weight loss and diarrhea\nHeadache and dizziness\nPallor\nShortness of breath\n', 'Headache, dizziness, pallor and shortness of breath are also symptoms of anemia. Anemia, particularly megaloblastic anemia, is often the first sign that there is an underlying folate deficiency, and doctors will usually test for folate and Vitamin B12 deficiencies when they encounter anemia.', 'Less common symptoms of folate deficiency are:[2]', '\nFast heartbeat (tachycardia)\nFast breathing (tachypnoea)\nExfoliative dermatitis, a condition which makes the skin red and scaly\nHeart murmur\nPainful swallowing\nA sore tongue (glossitis) and mouth ulcers\nPetechiae\nAngular stomatitis (fissures in the corners of the mouth)\n', 'In children with congenital malabsorption disorders, which are rare, neurological problems might also be present.']","['Folate deficiency has a number of potential causes. Most healthy people absorb sufficient folate from their diets to avoid deficiency, but in some cases the body may increase demand, which, if supplementation doesn’t occur, may lead to deficiency. In other cases, the body may be unable to absorb enough folate, due to low intake or excessive excretion.', 'Causes of folate deficiency include:[1][2][3][5]', '\nLow dietary intake due to medically restricted diets such as those followed by people with phenylketonuria or due to fad diets concentrating on foods that do not contain enough folate. Infants who are fed unfortified goat’s milk will also experience folate deficiency, as folate is not naturally present in goat’s milk.\nMalabsorption, which can be due to age, liver problems or gastrointestinal problems causing chronic diarrhoea, such as sprue, celiac disease or inflammatory bowel disease. Other causes of malabsorption are pancreatitis, bariatric surgery and extensive surgery involving the large or small intestine. Malabsorption is also a risk for people who use drugs that interfere with the absorption of folate, such as proton-pump inhibitors, some anticonvulsants such as carbamezapine, phenytoin, valproic acid, and phenobarbitol.[6]\nDisorders such as leukaemia, carcinomas and lymphomas, which increase the body’s demand for folate and may consequently lead to deficiency if folic acid supplements aren’t taken.\nAge, which causes changes in the gastrointestinal systems of people more than 65 years of age. These may lead to reduced absorption and reduced dietary intake. (See below.)\nAlcohol-related damage to the liver, which affects the way in which folate is stored in the liver and increases the amount of folate excreted in urine. People with alcohol dependence may also have a nutritionally insufficient diet. (See below.)\nPregnancy and lactation, which raise the body’s demand for folate considerably due to the growth of new tissue in both mother and fetus. Sufficient folic acid supplementation is crucial for pregnant women, as a deficiency may cause birth defects. (See below.)\nSmoking or exposure to secondhand smoke.[7]\nRenal dialysis, which affects the amounts of homocysteine in the body and therefore increases the amount of folic acid needed.\n']","['In most cases, folate deficiency is relatively easy to correct. In cases where a deficiency has set in due to poor diet or age, taking a folic acid supplement or modifying the diet is sufficient. However, if there is an underlying problem, like alcoholic changes to the liver or a drug interaction or condition causing malabsorption, specialised treatment will be required. The underlying causes of folate deficiency need to be addressed to prevent the problem recurring.', 'Folate deficiency is relatively easily treated in cases where the deficiency is not severe. However, where it has caused anemia, folic acid supplementation and/or correcting diet alone will not be enough. In women with megaloblastic anemia, vitamin B12 deficiency must be ruled out before any folic acid treatment can begin. If complications have occurred, or if there is an underlying condition or factor causing the folate deficiency, the affected person may have to be referred to one or more of the following kinds of doctor:[2]', '\nGastroenterologist, a doctor specialising in diseases and disorders of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, colon and rectum, as well as the pancreas, gallbladder, bile ducts and liver\nDietitian, a certified expert on diet and nutrition\nHematologist, a doctor specialising in diseases and disorders of the blood\n', 'Natural sources of folic acid', 'Folate is readily available in many whole foods, such as:[15]', '\nLeafy green vegetables such spinach, kale, broccoli, cabbage, and brussels sprouts\nBeetroot\nCitrus fruits\nLiver\nBeans and legumes such as peas, pinto, cannellini, or garbanzo beans/chickpeas\n', 'Good to know: Liver should be avoided by pregnant women, due to the high levels of Vitamin A it contains. Too much vitamin A can cause birth defects.', 'Supplementation with folate/folic acid', 'In some countries, such as the United States, South Africa, Chile, Canada and Costa Rica, grain cereal products (bread, pasta and cereal) are fortified with folic acid.[17] This is a major factor in reducing the number of neural tube defects that occur, but it is still recommended that anyone who is at risk of a deficiency, such as pregnant women, should make sure to get 400 micrograms of folate a day. This is especially the case if the following risk factors are present:', '\nCeliac disease or other intestinal absorption disorders\nThalassemia or sickle cell anemia; hereditary red blood cell disorders\nClinical obesity, a BMI of 30 or more.\nFamily history of, or partner with a family history of, neural tube defects.

This includes cheeses such as brie, camembert, as well as soft goats cheeses such as chevre. Soft blue cheeses, such as Gorgonzola and Roquefort, should also be avoided during pregnancy.', 'The reason these types of cheese are unsafe to eat during pregnancy is that there is a risk of these cheeses containing harmful bacteria, such as Listeria. Less acidic than hard cheeses, soft cheese contains more moisture, making them more susceptible to the growth of bacteria.', 'Although infection with bacteria is rare, extra precautions should be taken during pregnancy, because a Listeria infection increases the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, uterine infection and preterm delivery.[3][4]', 'Good to know: If they have been thoroughly cooked, e.g. in a sauce, all of the aforementioned cheeses are safe to eat during pregnancy.', 'Raw or undercooked eggs', 'During pregnancy, eggs should be cooked until both white and yolk are solid all the way through.

Pâté can potentially contain Listeria bacteria.', 'Raw or undercooked meat', 'Raw or undercooked meat should be avoided during pregnancy due to the risk of toxoplasmosis, an infection with bacteria often found in raw meat, as well as sheep, lamb and cat feces.', 'Toxoplasmosis is an infection by the Toxoplasma gondii parasite, one of the world’s most common parasites. In non-pregnant people, infection is usually harmless and often symptomless. In pregnant people, however, toxoplasmosis can increase the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, or damage to the organs of the developing baby. In particular, if a pregnant person is affected by toxoplasmosis, this can result in the baby developing eye damage.[6]', 'All meat, including items such as sausages, burgers and steaks, should be cooked thoroughly, until there is no residual blood or pinkness.', 'Precautions should also be taken when handling or cooking meat. This includes washing hands thoroughly and washing all surfaces and utensils that have come into contact with the meat just as thoroughly, too.', 'Cold cured meats', 'Some cold cured meats, such as chorizo, salami and prosciutto, are not cooked before being cured and fermented. Because of this, they contain a risk of toxoplasmosis and should be avoided.', 'Freezing the meat for 3-4 days kills the bacteria and makes it safe to eat. If the meat is cooked, it also becomes safe to eat.[7]', 'Undercooked ready meals', 'Due to the risk of listeria, all ready meals should be cooked according to the instructions outlined on the packaging.

They are classified as a primary headache, as they are not a symptom of another condition or injury. The principal trigger of tension headaches is thought to be stress, either a single stressful situation or a buildup of stress over a long period of time. Additional triggers may include lack of sleep, weather changes, excessive muscular tension, especially in the neck and shoulder area, and, in some people, the after effects of drinking alcohol.[5][6]', 'The sensation associated with a tension headache is often described as a dull pain or pressure around the head, usually on both sides, or the neck. Although they can be considerably painful, in most cases, the pain of a tension headache is mild to moderate and will not affect an individual’s ability to work or carry out daily tasks. If tension headaches occur under 15 times per month, they are classified as episodic tension headaches, whereas if they occur 15 times or more per month they are classified as chronic tension headaches. Both can last anywhere from around 30 minutes to a number of days, though chronic headaches will generally last longer.', 'Pain medication such as aspirin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen and naproxen can be effective in treating a tension headache.[7] Taking measures to reduce stress, such as exercise, meditation, therapy or using breathing techniques, can also be effective in preventing the onset of a tension headache, but are most effective when practiced on a regular basis.', 'If tension headaches are frequent and continuously treated with analgesics, there is a chance that the headaches may become chronic.

However, it is important to differentiate between a migraine and any other type of headache, as this will allow the sufferer to seek appropriate treatment  more quickly. The level and type of pain being experienced is the main way to tell the difference. The pain associated with a migraine will typically be severe, throbbing and, in 60 percent of cases, affect just one side of the head. A migraine may also be accompanied by nausea, pain in one eye or ear and pain in the temples, among other symptoms. A tension headache, another common type of headache, on the other hand, will typically involve less intense pain (though can be severe) and will generally affect both sides of the head. A doctor’s opinion should always be sought when a new type of headache occurs.

['Hemoglobin'],"['Hemoglobin (Hb or Hgb) is a complex protein found in red blood cells. Its primary function is to help circulate oxygen around the body and transport carbon dioxide from tissues to the lungs. Hemoglobin contains iron, which helps give blood its red color.[1]', 'How are hemoglobin levels measured?', 'Hemoglobin is measured as part of a complete blood count (CBC), also called a full blood count (FBC) – a routine test that is commonly ordered by doctors to help diagnose a range of conditions, such as infection, anemia or leukemia.[2] To carry out a CBC, a blood sample will typically be taken from a vein in the arm.', 'Read more about Hemoglobin Levels »', 'Hemoglobinopathy evaluation (hemoglobin electrophoresis)', 'A hemoglobinopathy evaluation, otherwise known as a hemoglobin electrophoresis, may be ordered as a follow-up test to a CBC if an individual shows signs of atypically high or low levels of hemoglobin. The test is able to detect the presence of abnormal types of hemoglobin and measure their relative amounts in the blood.', 'There are many types of hemoglobin, the most common being HbA, HbA2, HbF, HbS, HbC, HbE, HbH and HbM. Healthy blood contains significant levels of HbA and HbA2 only. The detection of other types in significant quantities can signal the presence of a variety of conditions. HbS and HbC, for example, are associated with hemolytic anemia.', 'What are normal hemoglobin levels?', 'What is considered to be a normal hemoglobin range typically depends on sex, age and general health. Abnormally low or high levels of hemoglobin can indicate a range of health conditions, including anemia and sickle cell disease.', 'High hemoglobin levels', 'Having high levels of hemoglobin is rare in comparison to low levels. Typically, the disorder will be noticed as part of a routine blood test, and treatment will be aimed at the underlying cause of the condition in the majority of cases.[3] High hemoglobin levels can result from smoking, dehydration, emphysema, copd or other chronic lung conditions, chronic heart problems, some blood marrow disorders including polycythemia vera, and some kidney or liver cancers.', 'Living at high altitudes can also cause high hemoglobin levels as a natural adaptation mechanism to compensate for less oxygen in the air.', 'The symptoms of high hemoglobin levels may often be related to the underlying condition that is causing them.

Typically, hemoglobin is not present in urine, so if hemoglobinuria occurs, it may be a sign of a medical condition in need of attention. Hemoglobinuria generally makes urine appear abnormally dark in color.[7]', 'Q: What is the relationship between hemoglobin and the hematocrit?\nA: A complete blood count (CBC) measures several components of the blood, including the levels of hemoglobin and the volume of red blood cells as compared to the total volume of blood, a measure known as the hematocrit. As hemoglobin is contained within red blood cells, both counts tend to correspond with one another: if hemoglobin levels are high, it is likely that the hematocrit will be too, and vice versa. To learn more about how to interpret a CBC, take a look at this resource on blood tests results.', 'Q: Is there a link between hemoglobin and cancer?\nA: Yes, some types of cancer can affect hemoglobin levels. For example, leukemia, lymphoma and other types of cancer that can induce blood loss, such as colon cancer, may lead to low levels, while others, including a kind of bone marrow cancer called polycythemia vera, can cause levels to rise. There is also a link between chemotherapy, a common cancer treatment, and low hemoglobin levels or anemia. Chemotherapy uses drugs administered intravenously, to destroy cancerous cells.

Hemoglobin, also written as haemoglobin, is a complex protein found in red blood cells which helps to circulate oxygen around the body and transport carbon dioxide from tissues to the lungs.[1] If a person’s levels of hemoglobin are either too low or too high, this can have a variety of consequences for one’s health.', 'High levels of hemoglobin are relatively rare, while low levels – a condition known as anemia – are relatively common and can occur in people of all ages, though they are especially common in pregnant women and people experiencing a range of other conditions. Treating both high and low levels of hemoglobin usually involves treatment for the underlying cause.', 'If you are experiencing symptoms that may be linked to hemoglobin levels, start a symptom assessment with the free Ada app now.', 'How are hemoglobin levels measured?', 'Hemoglobin is measured as part of a complete blood count (CBC) – a routine test that is commonly ordered by doctors to help diagnose a range of conditions, such as infection, anemia and leukemia.', 'To carry out a CBC, a blood sample – typically from a vein in the arm – first has to be taken. To measure hemoglobin, the blood will generally be combined with a liquid containing cyanide, which binds tightly to the hemoglobin molecules. By shining a light through the resulting solution (cyanmethemoglobin) and recording the amount of light which is absorbed, the levels of hemoglobin in the blood can be determined.', 'Read more about Blood Test Results »', 'What are normal hemoglobin levels?', 'Normal levels of hemoglobin in the blood typically depend on sex, age and general health. Abnormally low or high levels of hemoglobin can indicate a range of health conditions, including anemia and sickle cell disease.', 'According to the World Health Organization, normal hemoglobin levels are as follows:[2]', '\n6 months to 4 years: At or above 11 g/dL\n5-12 years: At or above 11.5 g/dL\n12-15 years: At or above 12 g/dL\nAdult male: 13.8 to 17.2  g/dL\nAdult female: 12.1 to 15.1 g/dL\nDuring pregnancy: At or above 11g/dL\n', 'Low hemoglobin levels', 'Having abnormally low levels of hemoglobin generally results in a condition known as anemia.

High hemoglobin levels may often be indicated by the presence of symptoms related to the causal underlying condition.', 'Experiencing high levels of hemoglobin can indicate a serious underlying condition, and urgent medical assistance should be sought.', 'Treatment for high hemoglobin levels', 'Treatment for high levels of hemoglobin depends upon the underlying cause of the condition. This may involve lifestyle changes, such as quitting smoking or more complex treatment methods to manage heart problems, for example.', 'Hemoglobin levels FAQs', 'Q: What are normal hemoglobin levels in infants?\nA: Normal hemoglobin levels in infants are as follows:[4]', '\n0-1 month: 13.3 - 19.9 gm/dL\n1-2 months: 10.7-17.1 gm/dL\n2-3 months 9.0-14.1 gm/dL\n3-6 months: 9.5-14.1 gm/dL\n6 months-1 year: 11.3-14.1 gm/dL\n', 'These ranges have been calculated using a range of medical sources. Normal hemoglobin ranges typically differ between laboratories, however, meaning some sources may differ from the levels stated here.', 'Q: What are normal hemoglobin levels in children and adults?\nA: Hemoglobin levels differ according to age, sex and general health. Normal ranges are as follows:[5]', '\nChildren: 11-13 gm/dL\nAdult males: 14-18 gm/dL\nAdult women: 12-16 gm/dL\nOlder men: 12.4-14.9 gm/dL\nOlder women: 11.7-13.8 gm/dL\n', 'Normal hemoglobin ranges typically differ between laboratories, meaning the ranges stated here may be slightly different to those stated elsewhere.', 'Q: What are normal hemoglobin levels in pregnant women?\nA: Normal hemoglobin levels during pregnancy are as follows:[6]', '\n1st trimester: 11.6-13.9 gm/dL\n2nd trimester: 9.7-14.8 gm/dL\n3rd trimester: 9.5-15 gm/dL\n', 'Normal hemoglobin ranges typically differ between laboratories, meaning the ranges stated here may be slightly different to those stated elsewhere.', 'Q: How are hemoglobin levels measured?\nA: Hemoglobin is measured as part of a complete blood count (CBC) – a routine test that is commonly ordered by doctors to help diagnose a range of conditions.[7]', 'To carry out a CBC, a blood sample – typically from a vein in the arm – first has to be taken.

By shining a light through the resulting solution (cyanmethemoglobin) and recording the amount of light which is absorbed, the levels of hemoglobin in the blood can be determined.[8]', 'Q: How can I increase my hemoglobin levels?\nA: Various minerals and vitamins can help to increase one’s hemoglobin count. These include iron, vitamin B6, vitamin B9 (folic acid), vitamin B12 and vitamin C. People with low hemoglobin levels may be prescribed supplements of one or more of these to help the body to produce more of the protein. Alternatively, various foodstuffs also contain these vitamins and minerals.', 'Foods that may help to increase hemoglobin levels include:[9]', '\nIron: Egg, cereals, green leafy vegetables, beans, meat and seafood\nVitamin B6: Meat, fish, vegetables, nuts and seeds\nVitamin B9 (folic acid): Green leafy vegetables, beans and fruits\nVitamin B12: Fish, meat and dairy\nVitamin C: Citrus fruits, broccoli, potatoes and tomatoes\n', 'When hemoglobin levels are severely low, a blood transfusion will typically be carried out to rapidly bring up an individual’s hemoglobin levels.', 'Q: When do low hemoglobin levels become dangerous?\nA: When hemoglobin levels become dangerously low, a blood transfusion will normally be required. The point at which a blood transfusion may be required varies between people, as the same level of hemoglobin can cause different symptoms or dangers in different people. The general health, age, sex and other factors will always be taken into consideration when deciding whether an individual is in need of a blood transfusion.[10]', 'According to the American Association of Blood Banks, a hemoglobin level of 7 m/dL or below should indicate the need for a blood transfusion in people who are otherwise medically stable. For those undergoing orthopedic or cardiac surgery, or for those with a preexisting cardiovascular condition, the threshold for blood transfusion should be a hemoglobin count of 8 m/dL or below.', 'Q: Why are hemoglobin levels low during pregnancy?\nA: Mild anemia is normal during pregnancy. When pregnant, the amount of blood produced in body increases by up to roughly 30 percent, thereby increasing the amount of iron needed to produce hemoglobin. When the body does not receive a sufficient amount of iron to do this, anemia can result. This is especially common in the second and third trimesters.[11]', 'Q: How to increase hemoglobin levels during pregnancy?\nA: Eating a diet containing large amounts of iron-rich foods such as green leafy vegetables, cereals and eggs is a good way of increasing hemoglobin levels and preventing anemia during pregnancy. Doctors will also generally suggest over-the-counter supplements or prescribe iron supplements to ensure an individual is consuming the recommended amount of iron daily, i.e. around 27 mg.[12] Some juices made of highly concentrated fruit extracts contain high levels of iron, and so not all doctors will find it necessary to prescribe pills.', 'Q: Can the use of tobacco products affect hemoglobin levels?\nA: Research suggests that tobacco has the effect of raising hemoglobin levels in the blood.[13] People who consume tobacco products, in particular people who smoke,´and who are experiencing high levels of hemoglobin, will be advised to quit the habit by medical professionals.', 'Q: Why do infants have high hemoglobin levels?\nA: Newborn babies typically have higher hemoglobin levels than older children and adults. The developing body of a baby consumes an elevated amount of oxygen, roughly three times that of adults based on weight, which in turn increases the need for hemoglobin. A hemoglobin count of 15 gm/dL is considered optimum for newborn babies.[14]', '', '\n\nMedicineNet. “Hemoglobin.” April 11, 2015.

['Hemophilia'],"['Hemophilia is a hereditary genetic bleeding disorder which causes blood clotting problems due to a lack in the proteins needed for normal blood clotting to take place. This causes people with hemophilia to bleed more than other people, for example, after injuries or surgeries. This condition is passed on the X chromosome, and for this reason, affects males more commonly than females. Diagnosis is made based on the symptoms, whether a family member is known to have hemophilia and by testing the clotting function of the blood. Preventing injuries and taking extra clotting proteins are two ways to prevent the complications of this condition. With good management, the outlook for people with hemophilia is good, although it depends on the severity of the clotting factor deficiency.']","['People with hemophilia tend to bruise or bleed excessively after small incidents or procedures. They may have a tendency to bruise, or to have severe episodes of nose bleeding, gum bleeding or even bleeding into joints. Women with hemophilia may have heavy periods. People with hemophilia are also at increased risk of bleeding in the bowel, which may cause red or black bowel movements.']",,"['Treatment of hemophilia depends on the ability of the blood to clot. People whose blood has some ability to clot may receive an injection to improve blood clotting before they have a procedure which may cause bleeding, such as dental work. People whose blood has little or no ability to clot alone may need to have regular injection to protect them in case of accidents. Treatment should be carried out by an expert in the field. People with hemophilia should wear a medic alert bracelet or carry a ID card with them in case of emergencies.']"
['Hemorrhagic Stroke'],"['Hemorrhagic stroke refers to an emergency where there is bleeding in the brain. This leads to damage and death of the nerve cells in the brain. This condition requires urgent review by a doctor. Common signs of stroke are drooping of one side of the face, weakness on one side of the body, slurred speech or loss of any other function controlled by the brain. The likelihood of stroke strongly increases with age. Stroke is one of the leading causes of disability and death worldwide.']","['The symptoms of a hemorrhagic stroke depend on the part of the brain affected. Common symptoms are a sudden, one-sided muscle weakness of the arm, leg and face, imbalance, slurred speech or difficulty speaking. Some people may have seizures. Other symptoms of stroke may be nausea and vomiting, or becoming drowsy and losing consciousness.']",,"['Hemorrhagic stroke is an emergency which is managed in hospital. Urgent treatment may be needed to treat ongoing bleeding in the brain. Complications, such as seizures, may also need urgent treatment. Long-term treatment involves good management of high blood pressure and rehabilitation (usually intensive physiotherapy and occupational therapy). Rehabilitation is important to help improve strength and help people learn to live with any disabilities following their stroke.']"

Most cases of herpes labialis do not need oral antivirals, and they are only really effective if treatment begins during the prodromal phase.

However, some types and strengths of ibuprofen are only available on prescription. These are usually prescribed for treating specific conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis.', 'Ibuprofen is available in various different forms, including:', '\nOral products, such as tablets, liquids and capsules\nOther formulations for oral consumption; i.e. in form of granules that can be dissolved in a hot drink\nTopical products, for application on the skin, such as creams, gels and sprays\nIn products where it is combined with other active ingredients, including other pain medications, such as paracetamol\n', 'Topical forms of ibuprofen tend to have fewer side-effects than oral ones. Therefore, in cases where ibuprofen is being used to treat an ongoing condition, e.g. pain related to a sporting injury, a locally applied topical form of ibuprofen ‒ such as a gel ‒ may be recommended.', 'Ibuprofen ingredients vary depending on the particular product used. In all ibuprofen products, the active ingredient, i.e. the element of the product which works as the painkiller, is ibuprofen itself, a white powder. Different products will contain different amounts of ibuprofen; oral products tend to come in dosage options of 200, 400, 600 or 800 mg.', 'In addition to the active ingredient ibuprofen and any other active ingredients that a given product may feature, such as paracetamol, painkilling products contain other ingredients, which do not treat pain or have any other medical use, but which give them their shape and/or consistency and taste, such as sucrose, lactose, glycerine, citric acid, and, in some cases, food colouring dyes. Always check the guidelines that come with the product for a complete list of ingredients, especially in the case of any known allergies or sensitivities.', 'Good to know: Like all pharmaceutical drugs, ibuprofen products will have an expiration date on their packaging. Research from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) suggests that, with some important exceptions like insulin and certain antibiotics, many pharmaceuticals retain most of their original potency after their expiration date.[5] However, in order to ensure that ibuprofen is safe and effective, medical guidelines recommend that any ibuprofen-containing products are taken within their expiry date.[6] Consuming expired meds also carries the risk that the shelf-life of the other ingredients in the product may be different to those of the active ingredients.', 'Ibuprofen vs aspirin', 'Ibuprofen and aspirin are both over-the-counter (OTC), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Both types of painkiller work by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, thereby reducing pain and inflammation.The FDA considers both effective drugs to treat minor, i.e. mild to moderate aches and pains such as are associated with menstrual pain, toothache and headaches.', 'However, they can be used to treat a slightly different range of conditions and also differ somewhat in their side effects.

As such, it relieves or reduces pain and fever, but not swelling or inflammation. This means that it is not a suitable alternative for treating swelling, for example, due to arthritis, or an injury.', 'Unlike NSAIDs, paracetamol is suitable for pregnant people and people using blood thinning medication, because it does not have the same anticoagulant (anti-clotting) effects on the blood.', 'Good to know: Despite some controversy, paracetamol is now considered not to be damaging to the stomach lining and will not, therefore, lead to ulcers. However, it may lead to stomach upsets, heartburn or nausea, especially in higher concentrations.[8][9][10]', 'High and/or frequent doses of paracetamol should be avoided, as this kind of use carries a risk of liver damage.[11]', 'Who can take ibuprofen?', 'Ibuprofen is suitable for most adults, and children who are at least six months old.

(For more information, see the FAQs.)', 'Drinking alcohol while taking ibuprofen', 'Drinking alcohol with ibuprofen excessively is not recommended, as it may make irritation irritation of the stomach even more likely and, over time, increases the chances of gastric side effects, like stomach ulcers. Ibuprofen can also cause liver damage in some cases, especially if taken in higher dosages over prolonged amounts of time; combining it with alcohol increases this risk. Most cases of liver toxicity due to ibuprofen are of mild to moderate severity and can be reversed by discontinuing the use of ibuprofen.[15]', 'How to take ibuprofen', 'Ibuprofen comes in many different oral and topical (to be applied on the skin) forms, so it is important to read the instructions that accompany the medication. The appropriate dosage depends on the strength and type of the ibuprofen and the age of the individual. The instructions will also explain how to store the ibuprofen. A cool, dry area is usually recommended,[16] but certain products may need to be refrigerated.', 'Ibuprofen should always be taken with or after food to avoid digestive discomfort.', 'The dosage guidelines vary between types of ibuprofen. Various OTC pain-relieving products may contain different strengths of ibuprofen. It is therefore vital to read the instructions associated with the particular type carefully before use and to note the maximum (max) dose suitable for the person taking the medicine.', 'It is important to ensure that there are appropriate intervals between doses. The amount of time that must pass before it is safe to take more ibuprofen depends on the strength of the product. For example, an adult may take one or two 200mg tablets every four to six hours, but should not take more than 1,200mg (six 200mg) tablets over a 24-hour period, if self-medicating.[2]', 'If prescribed and recommended by a doctor, adults can take up to a maximum of 2400 mg to 3200 mg within a 24 hour period.

If treating a child oneself, administer no more than 1200 mg of ibuprofen in 24 hours. If higher dosages are needed to relieve symptoms, please consult a doctor.\n', 'Ibuprofen side-effects', 'NSAIDs like ibuprofen can increase the likelihood of internal bleeding and can irritate the stomach and the gut. This is because the prostaglandins play several key roles within the body. In addition to the negative properties that the NSAIDs inhibit, i.e. causing pain and inflammation, prostaglandins perform positive functions such as protecting the lining of the gut and helping facilitate coagulation (clotting of the blood).[17]', 'Common ibuprofen side-effects include:', '\nNausea and/or vomiting\nAbdominal pain\nIndigestion\nConstipation\nBloating\nDiarrhea\n', 'Ibuprofen is also associated with some more serious, but less common, side-effects.', 'Less common ibuprofen side-effects include:', '\nDizziness\nDrowsiness\nHeadaches\nAllergic reactions, such as skin itching or a rash, up to severe allergic reactions that are an emergency\nGastric/stomach ulcers\nWorsening of asthma symptoms\nKidney failure\nProblems with the liver\nProblems with the heart and circulation, for example, strokes and heart attacks\nInternal bleeding, indicated by black stools and the presence of blood in one’s vomit\n', 'The likelihood of experiencing side-effects from ibuprofen is increased by:', '\nTaking more than the recommended dose\nTaking ibuprofen at high doses for long periods of time\nTaking ibuprofen with some of the drugs mentioned above, like corticosteroids\nBeing in poor general health\nBeing elderly\nHaving severe pre-existing kidney and/or liver diseases\n', 'Anyone who experiences side-effects as a result of taking ibuprofen should seek a medical opinion in a timely manner, as both internal bleeding and complications arising from stomach and/or gut irritation can become life-threatening if left unchecked/untreated.', 'Ibuprofen overdose', 'Most people can take up to 800mg of ibuprofen four times in a 24-hour period without the risk of overdosing.[3] However, overdoses of ibuprofen can be fatal, and symptoms of an overdose are not always seen immediately. For this reason, it is important and generally recommended to seek medical attention if a person has taken more than the maximum dose of ibuprofen recommended for their age and condition, especially when experiencing any of the symptoms below.', 'Symptoms of an overdose can include:', '\nVomiting\nNausea\nAbdominal pain\nBreathing difficulties\nReduced motor skills\nTinnitus (ringing in the ears)\n', 'Ibuprofen FAQs', 'Q: Can ibuprofen cause miscarriage?\nA: Ibuprofen is not suitable for use at any point during a pregnancy, but the risks posed to the developing fetus are different, depending on how many weeks pregnant a person is. Before week 30 of pregnancy, ibuprofen may increase the risk of miscarriage. Research indicates that taking any type of NSAID, including ibuprofen, during pregnancy can more than double the risk of miscarriage, compared to avoiding this type of painkiller. A possible explanation for the link between NSAIDs and miscarriage is that they may compromise the mechanism by which prostaglandins are naturally blocked in the body during pregnancy, thus causing miscarriage.[18]', 'After week 30 of pregnancy, ibuprofen may cause the baby to develop a heart problem and may reduce the amount of amniotic fluid in the womb.[19]', 'Q: What medications can be used safely by pregnant people, instead of ibuprofen?\nA: Paracetamol is the most suitable medication for pregnant people to use instead of ibuprofen. There is no evidence that paracetamol poses risks to a developing baby, and this medication can provide pain relief and/or reduce the symptoms of a fever, similar to the effects of ibuprofen. Pregnant people are recommended to take the lowest possible dose of paracetamol, for the shortest possible time.[20]', 'Good to know: Many OTC brands of paracetamol also contain caffeine. Excess caffeine intake should be avoided during pregnancy, so it is important to ensure that any paracetamol intended for use by a pregnant person is caffeine-free.[20]', 'Q: Is ibuprofen suitable to use when breastfeeding?\nA: In general, ibuprofen is safe to use when breastfeeding, unless a person has asthma or a stomach ulcer which gets worse when they take ibuprofen. Only small amounts of ibuprofen are usually present in breast milk and these are not believed to cause harm to the baby. However, if a baby has a low birth weight, was born prematurely or has a medical condition, it is advisable to consult a doctor before using ibuprofen, as the traces in breast milk may be harmful in these cases.[21]', 'Q: Is it safe to drink alcohol at the same time as using ibuprofen?\nA: Drinking alcohol excessively when taking any NSAID is likely to irritate the stomach. Drinking a moderate amount of alcohol is not thought to have an impact on the safety or effectiveness of taking ibuprofen, provided a person is over 21 years of age, is not pregnant and is not affected by any long-term health conditions. The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that women drink no more than one drink per day and that men drink no more than two drinks per day.[22]', 'Q: Does ibuprofen reduce swelling?\nA: Yes. Ibuprofen works by blocking the production of prostaglandins, which the body produces in response to illness and/or injury, and which cause pain, inflammation, fever and swelling. Although ibuprofen can temporarily reduce swelling, the root cause of the illness or injury may need to be addressed before the body stops producing the swelling. For example, ibuprofen may temporarily relieve the pain and swelling associated with dental abscess, but, in almost all dental abscess cases, a visit to the dentist may be required in order to treat the problem fully and prevent further pain and swelling developing at the site of the problem.[23]', 'Q: Is ibuprofen a blood thinner?\nA: Ibuprofen is not designed to be used as a blood thinning medication. However, like other NSAIDs, it interferes with the way that platelets work, and thus can make the body’s blood clotting abilities less efficient than normal. For this reason, ibuprofen is often described as a blood thinner. Ibuprofen is not recommended for use with actual blood thinners, i.e. antiplatelet drugs or anticoagulants, because of this property. It is recommended that people who are using prescription blood thinners and who need to use painkillers opt for paracetamol, rather than ibuprofen or aspirin, to avoid interactions related to blood thinning. However, anybody who is on a course of blood thinning medication should only use painkillers according to their doctors recommendations, with caution, and in the lowest possible dose.[24]', 'Q: Is it bad to take ibuprofen every day?\nA: Yes. Ibuprofen is only recommended for short-term use; as long-term or regular use, it is linked to an increased likelihood of experiencing harmful side effects, such as stomach ulcers and heart problems. Seek a medical opinion if you need to use a painkiller for long-term pain management, so a doctor can find the best way to help you, and, if necessary, prescribe a safe alternative. Feeling unwell?

However, it is always advisable to check whether any medication, including other pain-relief and anti-inflammatory medication, will perform differently in the body when grapefruit is consumed. Grapefruit, especially grapefruit juice, contains particular chemicals which can alter the way the body metabolizes (breaks down) some medications, resulting in more, or, in some cases, less, than the required quantity of a given drug entering a person’s bloodstream. All OTC medications come with a “Drug Facts” label which will mention whether there is any cross-reactivity with grapefruit.[25]', '', '\n\n“An Overview of Clinical Pharmacology of Ibuprofen.” Oman Medical Journal.

If the rash becomes infected, there might be a thick, yellow ooze, as well as redness and crusting of the areas of eczema.']",,['Keeping the skin moist helps to soothe the symptoms of atopic eczema. Some people use wet cloths or bandages on areas of dry and irritated skin. Using soaps or bath preparations which contain moisturizers or oils can be helpful in soothing the skin and protecting against irritating substances. Steroid creams are often used to treat flares of eczema. Antihistamine tablets can also be helpful to reduce itchiness.']
['Infantile Colic'],"['Infantile colic is a condition, in which an otherwise healthy baby cries excessively, frequently and at an abnormally high pitch. These crying episodes, which often occur in the evening, are the most typical symptom. Colicky babies may also be inconsolable during a crying episode.', 'A physician should exclude any other cause for the excessive crying in order to confirm the diagnosis of infantile colic. Laboratory tests are not usually necessary, unless there is reason to suspect that the crying is caused by an underlying medical condition.[1]', 'Generally, the condition tends to resolve on its own, with no long-term complications. Studies suggest that up to 40 percent of all newborns and infants experience infantile colic at some point.[2]']","['The most typical symptom of infantile colic is episodes of high-pitched, excessive crying, which often occur during the evening hours. Colicky crying is often described as more high-pitched and strained than ordinary crying[1].', 'The rule of three is often used to determine whether the excessive crying is the result of colic. Colicky babies may cry for:[2]', '\nThree or more hours a day\nThree or more days a week\nThree or more weeks\n', 'Not all babies with colic will necessarily follow this pattern. If a parent is unsure of whether the crying is colic or not, they should consult their baby’s doctor or nurse.', 'Good to know: Colicky crying is still within the normal range of infant crying. Most infants cry more in the afternoon and evening, with their tendency to cry peaking at around six weeks of age. The difference between normal crying and colicky crying is that babies with colic cry for longer than babies without, and are much harder to soothe.[2]', 'Babies with colic may show distinctive behaviour while crying. They may:[2][1]', '\nGrimace or scowl\nFurrow their brows\nDraw their legs up to their belly\nClench fists\nFlush\nStiffen\n', 'The infants are usually otherwise healthy babies, with a normal appetite and normal weight gain.', 'However, some behaviours that are associated with crying, but are not part of normal crying, may indicate an undiagnosed cardiopulmonary disorder. These include:[2]', '\nApnea, a temporary pause in breathing during sleep, or struggling to breath\nCyanosis, a bluish colour in the skin or mucus membranes that indicates low oxygen levels in the blood\nFever\n', 'Good to know: If a baby exhibits any of these three symptoms, they should be taken to a medical practitioner immediately.', 'Worried that your baby may have infantile colic? Begin a free symptoms assessment in the Ada app now.']","['The causes of infantile colic are largely unknown. However, colic may be the result of physical, social and/or environmental factors that may be out of the parents’ control. These include:[2][1][3]', '\nAn imbalance in the infant’s gut microflora\nOverfeeding or underfeeding\nFood allergies, including allergy to milk proteins and lactose intolerance\nIncomplete burping after feeding\nExposure to cigarette smoke or metabolites of cigarette smoke\nParental stress or anxiety\n', 'There is some evidence that colic is more common in infants whose mothers have had postpartum depression.[1] It is known that babies respond to parental anxiety. Lactose intolerance is a relatively rare cause of colic. There is some evidence that breastfed infants are less likely to have infantile colic.[4]', 'There is no evidence that fermentation in the colon causes colic.[1]']","['Since the causes of the condition are largely unknown, treatment options are limited. As the condition does not cause serious problems, parents are advised to develop techniques to help the infant to stop crying, such as singing, swaddling or holding the infant.', 'It is also important to make sure that the baby is in an upright position during feeding. Changes in feeding habits or diet are usually not recommended.', 'Parental reassurance and stress management', 'One of the most important elements of treatment for infantile colic is keeping the parents calm and to reassure them that the condition is temporary and that their baby is generally healthy.[2]', 'Colic is distressing for babies and their caregivers, and colicky babies are at increased risk of being shaken and injured,[3] as parents may become frustrated that they cannot calm or console the baby during a crying episode.', 'Because colicky babies cannot be soothed, caregivers may set the baby down in a safe place, such as their cot, to cry unattended for a short while. This is acceptable, as long as the baby is not cold, wet, unwell, hungry or too hot,[3], and as long as the baby is not left alone for very long.', 'Because colicky crying also occurs most often in the evening, parents may also experience some sleep loss, which can contribute to feelings of frustration and stress. Parents should take care to ensure that they are rested, possibly by taking it in turns to attend to the baby. It is also acceptable to leave the baby with other competent caregivers for short periods of time, in order for parents to rest.[3]', 'Good to know: Colicky babies should not be left unattended for long periods of time.', 'Drugs, medication and dietary modifications for colic', 'Medication is not usually very useful in treating colic. In some cases, if the mother is breastfeeding the infant, colic can be alleviated by excluding some foods from the mother’s diet. These include:[1]', '\nCow’s milk and dairy products\nEggs\nWheat\nNuts\nSpice and garlic\nCaffeine\nAlcohol\n', 'Eliminating these foods will not necessarily help relieve infantile colic in all cases.', 'If the cause of the colicky crying is suspected to be an allergy to cow’s milk, a low-lactose formula or lactase drops, which are added to milk, may be recommended. Soy-based formulas are not very often recommended for colicky babies.[1] However, lactose intolerance is relatively rare.', 'Good to know: Spinal manipulation, while occasionally said to relieve colic, is unsafe for babies and should not be considered as a treatment option. Likewise, sedatives such as phenobarbital and chloral hydrate are unsafe for babies and should not be used in the treatment of colic.', 'Gripe water', 'Gripe water[6] is a traditional remedy for colic, and while there is anecdotal evidence that it works, no formal reviews have ever proven that it is helpful. Many brands of gripe water contain alcohol, dill oil, an alkalinizing agent, such as bicarbonate of soda, and sugar. In many countries, the composition of gripe water is not regulated. Gripe water may also cause constipation.', 'Alcohol is unsafe for babies, while dill oil may only be of help in cases where excess gas is a cause of pain. Bicarbonate of soda is not thought to be helpful, as stomach acid is not the cause of colic.', 'There is some evidence that administering an oral sweet solution of sugar to babies does help to relieve pain, and this is probably the basis for the success of gripe water in relieving colic, as the sweetness itself is soothing. However, in this case, it is better to consult a doctor about using a simple oral glucose solution rather than gripe water.', 'Other names for infantile colic', '\nBaby colic\nInfant colic\nColic\n', '', '\n\nMedscape. “Colic: Practice essentials.” 28 November 2017.

['Infective Endocarditis'],"['Infective endocarditis is an infection of the inner lining of the heart and the heart valves with bacteria or, less commonly, a fungus. People at risk of this condition are people who have had a procedure involving their blood vessels, people who have had heart valve problems in the past, and people who use IV drugs. Symptoms can be unspecific, and include fever, weakness, a loss of appetite, sweating, shortness of breath and swelling of the feet. Diagnosis is sometimes difficult and has to fulfill certain criteria, such as evidence of the bug causing the infection in several blood samples. Intravenous antibiotic treatment (through a drip) over several weeks is needed to completely treat the infection. Even with appropriate treatment this condition can be life-threatening.']","['The symptoms of infective endocarditis may begin slowly and be vague in the early stages. General symptoms include nausea, a fast pulse, a feeling of weakness, weight loss, sweating and joint pain. People with infective endocarditis may have a fever that comes and goes. Small red spots under the nails, on the palms or the soles may be visible. Other symptoms may occur if organs are damaged, and this is may be different from person to person. Some people may develop a cough, become slowly more short of breath, or develop swelling of the feet and legs.']",,"['Treatment involves intravenous (through a drip) antibiotics over several weeks. If there is damage to the heart valves, surgical replacement of the damaged valves may be necessary.']"
['Influenza Infection'],"['An influenza infection, or the flu, is a common viral infection of the airways that most commonly occurs in fall and winter. The influenza virus is spread in droplets from the mouth and nose, which can be sent into the air while sneezing or coughing, or passed by sharing crockery or cutlery. People who are older than 65 or who have other medical conditions tend to get the flu more commonly, and are at risk of developing a severe flu. This condition causes fever, cough, a runny nose and muscle aches and pains. In most cases, no specific treatment is needed, and people get better within a week. In rare cases, influenza can cause a severe infection, and this condition can become life-threatening.']","['The typical symptoms of the flu include fever, coughing, a sore throat, runny nose, muscle and joint pain, and feeling generally unwell. The lymph glands in the throat may be bigger than usual. Symptoms of a severe infection which may need emergency treatment are shortness of breath, wheezing and breathing difficulties.']",,"['In most cases, no specific treatment is needed. People with the flu should stay home from school or work, rest and take plenty of fluids. Drinking warm drinks or using lozenge may help soothe a sore throat. Paracetamol or ibuprofen can help relieve the headache and muscle aches. If the runny nose is bothersome, decongestant sprays or tablets may be helpful. If the infection is severe, there are some anti-viral medications which target flu, but these make little difference to recovery in people with mild or moderate symptoms.']"
['Inguinal Hernia'],"['An inguinal hernia occurs when the intestine pokes through a hole in the abdominal wall in the groin area. Inguinal hernias are relatively common. This condition mostly affects older men. The most common symptom of an inguinal hernia is a lump in the groin area, which may go away temporarily when pushed on. The diagnosis is made by a doctor examining the lump and examining the lump with an ultrasound scan of the area. As untreated hernias can sometimes cause bowel to become trapped and die, the hole in the abdominal wall is often repaired surgically. A trapped hernia is an emergency and needs urgent treatment. Surgical treatment usually works well to cure this condition.']","['Typical symptoms include a bulge in the groin area or scrotum. This lump may be uncomfortable or painful, especially when exercising. It may be possible to reduce the bulge by pushing on it, but it will eventually come back.']",,['Treatment involves repairing the hole in the abdominal wall at surgery. One option involves placing a mesh over in the groin area to cover and support the hole which causes the hernia. This is usually done laparoscopically (with keyhole surgery).']
['Iron Deficiency (Anemia)'],"['Iron deficiency refers to inadequate levels of the mineral iron in the body. The term is commonly used interchangeably with anemia: a condition often caused by iron deficiency, where the body either cannot produce a sufficient number of healthy red blood cells, or enough of the protein (hemoglobin) that allows red blood cells to carry oxygen around the body.', 'However, health problems may arise before iron levels drop to the extent that anemia develops. For this reason, the terms “iron depletion” and “non-anemic iron deficiency” are sometimes also used.[1]', 'Iron is a micronutrient that is vital for the healthy functioning of the body. It is an important part of the production of red blood cells, skin, hair, nails, muscles and hormones. Iron also plays a key role in the functioning of nerve cells.[2]', 'For many people, a balanced and varied diet provides all the iron they need. Good sources of iron include liver, meat, beans, nuts, whole grains, fortified breakfast cereals and dark-green leafy vegetables.[3]', 'However, iron deficiency is very common in both developing and developed countries, making it the most widespread nutritional disorder in the world.[4] Groups of people who are particularly at risk of developing iron deficiency include pregnant women, premenopausal women, infants, children, teenagers and the elderly.[1][5]', 'Iron deficiency may be the result of a number of different factors and conditions. Some of the most common causes of iron deficiency are inadequate dietary intake, continuous blood loss, increased need and inadequate absorption.[1][5]', 'Symptoms of iron deficiency do not always manifest until iron-deficiency anemia develops, but may include fatigue; paleness; dizziness; an inability to concentrate and diminished productivity; unhealthy nails, skin and hair and a painful tongue, among others.[1][5]', 'If left untreated, iron-deficiency anemia can have serious consequences, including increased susceptibility to illness and infection,[6] pregnancy complications, impaired cognitive and physical development, heart failure[7] and increased risk of morbidity in children.[4] However, iron deficiency is generally fairly easy to treat by addressing underlying conditions, making dietary modifications and taking supplements where necessary.[1][4][5]']","['Tiredness and a reduced ability to exercise may be experienced before anemia develops.[8] However, signs of low iron may not be noticeable in many people until the deficiency has advanced to anemia.[1] Even then, some people may present with few or no symptoms.[6][8] The severity of the symptoms typically depends on how rapidly anemia develops and the extent of the deficiency.[6][9]', 'People experiencing possible symptoms of iron deficiency can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.', 'Main symptoms', 'Where present, some of the more common symptoms of iron deficiency may include:[7][10][6]', '\nFatigue\nDifficulty concentrating on work or studies\nMemory problems\nHeadaches\nFaintness and dizziness\nBreathlessness\nReduced ability to exercise\nPale complexion\nPoor condition of hair, sometimes with hair loss\nBrittle nails that break easily, change shape or develop ridges\nSlow-healing wounds\nSore, inflamed tongue\nSores at the corners of the mouth\nRestless legs syndrome\nDelayed development in babies\n', 'Less common symptoms', 'Some of the less common symptoms of iron deficiency may include:[6][9][11]', '\nItching\nTinnitus (ringing in the ears)\nChanges in sense of taste\nChest pain (usually in people where there is pre-existing heart disease)\nCraving or eating clay, chalk, coal, ice, paper or other non-food substances (Pica syndrome)\nDifficulty swallowing (very rare)\n', 'Many of the symptoms of iron deficiency are nonspecific and may be indicative of other conditions.[12][10] In addition, there are a number of different types of anemia, all of which require different treatments. For this reason, it is important to consult with a medical practitioner should any of the above symptoms present.']","['There are a number of possible causes of iron deficiency (which may lead to iron-deficiency anemia). Many of these involve different types of blood loss, which equates to the loss of cells that contain iron. An iron deficiency can result as a consequence.', 'Causes of iron deficiency include:[7][8][9]', '\nDietary deficiency. A diet that is lacking in iron can lead to iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia. This is more common in developing countries and people who follow very restrictive diets.\nMenstruation. Women with heavy menstrual periods may develop iron deficiency if the amount of iron in their diet is insufficient to replace that lost during their periods.\nPregnancy. Women who are pregnant require more iron than usual, and anemia often results when the levels in their diet are insufficient to support both their needs and those of the baby.\nBleeding from the gut. Certain conditions can cause bleeding from the stomach and intestines. These include stomach or duodenal ulcers, inflammation of the large intestine or oesophagus, hemorrhoids and bowel cancer, among others. Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) like aspirin and ibuprofen can also sometimes cause bleeding.\nBleeding from the kidneys. Certain conditions that affect the kidneys and bladder can cause bleeding and subsequent iron loss.\nImpaired absorption. Certain health conditions can impede absorption of iron from the gut. These conditions include celiac disease, infections with the bacteria Helicobacter pylori (H.pylori),[8] and inflammatory bowel disease, among others. Gastric surgery may also lead to impaired absorption of iron.\nParasitic infection. Hookworm infection can result in chronic blood loss and is a major cause of iron deficiency worldwide. Those living in or traveling to certain tropical countries are particularly at risk.\nMalaria. A relationship exists between malaria and iron deficiency in tropical parts of the world.\n', 'Other possible causes of iron deficiency include blood loss from surgery, chronic inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis,[1] cancer and overtraining in athletes.[8] Diets very high in substances that interfere with iron absorption (for example, dairy, tea and phytates) may also be implicated in the development of iron deficiency.[1][7] Heavy nosebleeds and blood donation can also lead to iron deficiency, though these potential causes may be overlooked by healthcare practitioners.[9]']","['Treatment for iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia typically involves addressing the underlying cause, increasing the amount of iron in the diet and sometimes taking iron supplements. Both liquid and tablet iron supplements are available; a doctor will advise on the type and dosage required. The length of time a person needs to take an iron supplement will depend on the severity of the iron deficiency.[7]', 'Commonly prescribed iron supplements include ferrous sulfate, ferrous fumarate and ferrous gluconate – all of which are equally effective.[11] All iron supplements can be toxic in high doses, and should be kept out of reach of children.', 'Iron supplements may cause unpleasant side-effects, including nausea, stomach pain, heartburn, diarrhea and constipation.[11] Taking lower doses or taking the supplement with meals can help to reduce the likelihood and severity of these side-effects.[2] A doctor may advise taking the iron supplement with orange juice or vitamin C to enhance absorption of the mineral.[13]', 'Not all cases of iron deficiency will require treatment with a medical supplement. If the deficiency is mild, it may be sufficient to take a natural supplement like a highly concentrated juice made from plants that are rich in iron. Some people may find this kind of supplement more palatable and easier to take on a regular basis.', 'A person with iron deficiency will typically start to feel better within a few days of starting their treatment program.[8] They will usually be asked to have follow-up blood tests a few weeks later to confirm that the treatment is working. Even after their iron levels have returned to the normal range, the treatment will usually continue for another three months or more, and the person will be asked to have regular blood tests to ensure that they do not develop iron deficiency again.[7]', 'Unless the iron deficiency is related to a serious underlying health condition, the treatment is usually effective.[6]']"
['Irritable Bowel Syndrome'],"['Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder affecting bowel function, characterized by symptoms mostly relating to digestive discomfort, including diarrhea, constipation, bloating, gas, cramping, and abdominal pain. IBS affects around 11 % of the population globally. In western countries, such as the U.S., women are significantly more likely to be affected by IBS than men, but this ratio varies dramatically around the world; in India, for example, between 80 and 90 percent of those affected are male. People who have a family history of irritable bowel syndrome are more likely to develop the condition than those who do not.[1]', 'Different people will experience different combinations of the possible symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), thus requiring varying treatments. Diagnosis of IBS will involve identifying triggers of its symptoms, which are usually gastrointestinal and related to a person’s diet and lifestyle, so that a person’s exposure to triggers that activate irritable bowel syndrome can be minimised as part of their treatment plan.', 'IBS can be a long-term condition requiring careful management. The improvement of a person’s digestive health is often brought about by a combination of lifestyle and diet changes designed to reduce instances of bloating, constipation, diarrhea and other symptoms they may be experiencing. Changes to a person’s diet may involve adopting a low FODMAP diet; a diet low in fermentable short-chain carbohydrates. (See the “Treatment” section of this resource for more information about FODMAP foods.) Pharmaceutical interventions may be used to treat chronic (persistent) cases of IBS.', 'Irritable bowel syndrome does not cause inflammation or permanent damage such as bleeding or ulcers, nor an increased risk of cancers.', 'Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) vs. inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)', 'Both IBS and IBD are conditions which affect the gastrointestinal tract, which is part of the digestive system. Though the symptoms of IBS and IBD can be similar, including abdominal pain, bloating, constipation, diarrhea and abdominal cramping, IBD is a more serious condition.', 'Inflammatory bowel diseases are a group of conditions in which the body’s own immune system attacks parts of the digestive system in the gastrointestinal tract. This group includes chronic diseases such as ulcerative colitis, which affects the large intestine, and Crohn’s disease, which can affect the entire digestive tract, damaging both the surface and the deep tissues of the intestines.[2]', 'In contrast, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) only affects the function and behaviour of the intestines. IBS is not an autoimmune condition. Although IBD does not cause IBS, those affected by IBD have a greater likelihood of developing the !BS than the general population. In contrast, having IBS has no impact on a person’s likelihood of developing IBD.[2]', 'Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms', 'Different kinds of IBS are diagnosed according to their symptoms, with people experiencing different combinations of the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, including bloating, diarrhea, constipation and painful abdominal cramps.', 'Diarrhea and constipation may each affect people with IBS on their own, together, or in alternating periods.', 'Common symptoms include:[3]', 'Abdominal pain and cramping', 'Abdominal pain and cramping, particularly felt in the lower belly, is one of the most common symptoms of IBS. Abdominal cramps can be caused by constipation or diarrhea, other symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. They typically increase after meals. For some people affected by IBS, having a bowel movement (BM) can intensify pain and cramping; for others, having a BM can reduce these symptoms.', 'Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with predominant diarrhea', 'Some people experience diarrhea as a main symptom of irritable bowel syndrome, passing loose, watery stools more than three times per day. In people with IBS, diarrhea may occur suddenly, particularly after encountering triggers of their symptoms. In cases of irritable bowel syndrome in which a person experiences diarrhea as one of their most prominent symptoms, the condition is sometimes called IBS-D. Altering a person’s diet is the first-line treatment for IBS-D, followed by prescribing medications.[4]', 'Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with predominant constipation', 'Those experiencing constipation as a symptom of IBS may pass fewer than three\nbowel movements per week. When it is passed, stool is often small and hard. When a person experiences constipation as one of the principal symptoms of their irritable bowel syndrome, this is sometimes called IBS-C.', 'Good to know: IBS-C shares many symptoms ‒ including bloating, abdominal pain and infrequent, difficult bowel movements ‒ with another common gastrointestinal disorder, chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC). Current research suggests that that IBS-C and CIC are different conditions, despite their significantly overlapping symptoms. If a person seeks medical attention for constipation, doctors will ensure that appropriate testing is undertaken so that a differential diagnosis can be made, as these conditions require different treatment approaches to relieve constipation.[5]', 'Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with constipation and diarrhea', 'When a person is equally affected by constipation and diarrhea as symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, this is called IBS-M (mixed irritable bowel syndrome) or IBS-A (alternating irritable bowel syndrome.', 'Rectal tenesmus', 'Rectal tenesmus involves cramping and spasms in the rectum. This leads to feeling that a bowel movement is incomplete, even if the bowel has actually been evacuated successfully. This feeling may lead to abdominal pain and cramping, associated with straining to bring about a bowel movement.', 'Good to know: Tenesmus is a symptom of many other gastrointestinal conditions, as well as a symptom of IBS. If a person seeks medical attention for rectal tenesmus, doctors will check for inflammation of the colon, to rule out a diagnosis such as ulcerative colitis (a form of IBD) or colon cancer.', 'Bloating and gas', 'Many people with IBS experience intense bloating (a sensation of increased abdominal pressure). This may or may not be due to an increased quantity of gas in the gastrointestinal tract; about 50 % of people experience increased abdominal pressure without a buildup of gas.[6]', 'Some people with irritable bowel syndrome also experience increased burping.', 'Mucus in stool', 'Passing mucus in the stool is a common symptom of IBS, but passing blood may indicate a more serious condition affecting the bowel, colon or gastrointestinal tract. Always seek medical attention for a prompt diagnosis if blood is present in bowel movements.', 'People experiencing any possible symptoms of IBS can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.', 'Causes of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)', 'Despite ongoing research to determine definitive causes of IBS, these are still unclear. Contributing\nfactors may include infection, neurohormonal factors, food sensitivities and bacterial overgrowth. An individual’s psychological condition, hormone changes or stress levels are other possible causes.', 'Infection', 'It has been observed that some patients experience their first IBS symptoms after acute infectious\nenteritis. This so-called postinfectious IBS may be caused by viral, bacterial, protozoan or helminth\ninfection. Several research studies have shown that IBS symptoms can increase after infectious enteritis, but the actual cause of these symptoms requires further research.', 'Neurohormonal factors', 'Some people experience visceral hypersensitivity, which is a greater sensitivity to pain from the\norgans, including the stretching of the bowel as gas or stool passes through it. This may be linked\nto IBS symptoms including abdominal pain, urgent bowel movements, and bloating. However, the cause of this hypersensitivity is unknown.[7] It is also possible that the brain of a person with IBS\nprocesses pain differently than that of an unaffected person, or that other differences in the\nsignals passed between the brain and the intestinal tract are related to IBS.[8]', 'Neurotransmitters or reproductive hormones may be imbalanced in some people with IBS, and these may be affected by changes to an individual’s hormones, such as throughout the menstrual cycle. The possible role of sexual hormones in IBS may be supported by the fact that roughly twice as many women as men are affected in some countries.[9]', 'Food sensitivities', 'It has been observed that an individual with IBS may experience symptoms more often due to an\nintolerance of foods such as wheat; dairy products; fatty, creamy or fried foods; alliums such as\ngarlic or onions; stone fruits and other kinds of fruit; brassicae such as cabbage, cauliflower\nor Brussels sprouts; pulses such as lentils or beans and chili peppers.', 'Eliminating certain foods from the diet has been shown by some dietary studies to relieve the symptoms of IBS, but these foods vary according to the individual. More research on food sensitivities and their effect on IBS is required.', 'SIBO', 'Small intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is when too many of the gut’s naturally occurring\nbacteria accumulate in the small intestine. Some research has linked SIBO to IBS, and that\nantibiotic treatment has decreased IBS symptoms in some people with SIBO.[10] It is not clear\nfrom this research whether antibiotics affect the SIBO directly, or affect the IBS in a\ndifferent manner.', 'Malabsorption of fructose', 'In some people, IBS symptoms can be caused by the digestive system failing to absorb fructose effectively. Fructose is a kind of sugar found in fruits and some vegetables, and is often used as an artificial sweetener in processed foods. When fructose is not absorbed properly by the digestive system, it can ferment in the colon (large intestine). This can result in gastrointestinal symptoms such as gas, bloating and diarrhea.', 'For people whose IBS is believed to result from malabsorption of fructose, eating foods which are low in fructose may be helpful in reducing their symptoms. See this resource from the University of Virginia’s Digestive Health Centre for more information on low-fructose foods.', 'Additional factors', 'IBS is often linked to psychological factors such as stress, anxiety or depression, and stress\nmanagement is one possible treatment tool. Genetics may play a role in the development of IBS,\nbut there is limited evidence to support this.', 'Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) diagnosis', 'A diagnosis of IBS is usually made by considering recurrence of symptoms over a period of three to six months, rather than solely through a physical examination or by visual inspection of the bowel during colonoscopy. To assist doctors in making a diagnosis, a person may keep a diary of their diet and gastrointestinal symptoms during this period, in order to identify factors which may be triggering their possible IBS.', 'Although it does not form the sole basis of a diagnosis of IBS, a colonoscopy may still be performed as part of an IBS diagnosis to help rule out other issues. This is an imaging procedure in which the colon or large intestine is visualised by inserting a thin, flexible tube containing a camera into the body through the rectum. See this resource on preparing for a colonoscopy for more information.', 'Other possible measures which may be used in making a potential diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome include a blood or stool test, flexible sigmoidoscopy or a barium series.[11]', 'People experiencing possible symptoms of IBS can also use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.', 'Irritable bowel syndrome treatments', 'Lifestyle changes', 'Lifestyle changes addressing diet or stress are usually the first approach to IBS treatment.', 'Stress and anxiety treatments', 'Addressing generalized stress and anxiety is a common treatment approach. Some people experience\nanxiety around their IBS symptoms (known as GI symptom-specific anxiety), and may limit their\nexposure to activities and situations that would be affected by their IBS. This can increase\ntheir anxiety, creating a vicious cycle that increases their symptoms. Therapies like cognitive\nbehavioral therapy, psychotherapy, relaxation therapy, biofeedback and hypnotherapy may be used\nto help individuals both manage general stress and break this cycle.\nSelf-care to manage stress is another option, with common techniques including meditation,\nyoga and exercise.', 'IBS and diet', 'Each person has different dietary triggers for IBS. If sensitivity to specific foods is a trigger\nfor IBS symptoms, treatment may include reducing or eliminating these foods from the diet. Many people find it helpful to avoid high-FODMAP foods; FODMAP stands for: Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides And polyols; fermentable short-chain carbohydrates which are prevalent in a regular diet, which the small intestine does not absorb very well.[12]', 'Examples of low FODMAP foods which may ease symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome when included in a person’s diet include:[12]', 'Lactose-free or low-lactose dairy products, such as non-dairy milks, hard cheeses such as cheddar\nLow-fructose fruits such as oranges, kiwis and strawberries\nLow-fructan vegetables such as bean sprouts, carrots, eggplant, potatoes, olives, turnips\nProtein such as lean meat and tofu\nGluten-free grains', 'Examples of high FODMAP foods, which may aggravate symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, and should be excluded from one’s diet where possible, include:[12]', 'Lactose; cow’s milk, yoghurt, and cream\nFructose; fruits and products high in natural sugars from fruit, such as apples, pears, peaches, corn syrup\nFructans; vegetables and grains high in fructans include artichokes, garlic, onions, broccoli, beetroot and grains such as wheat and rye\nPolyols; sweeteners such as sorbitol and xylitol, found in sugar-free products', 'Another approach to alleviating symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome by changing one’s diet is to eat smaller, more frequent meals. Eating more slowly can reduce gas and bloating. Along with an individual’s possible food intolerances, foods commonly associated with abdominal cramping or diarrhea include coffee, caffeine, alcohol or high-fat foods, as well as poorly-digested sugars, such as sorbitol or fructose. Beans, raisins or breads can cause gas, and lactose intolerance can trigger IBS symptoms.

Abdominal cramps can be caused by constipation or diarrhea, other symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. They typically increase after meals. For some people affected by IBS, having a bowel movement (BM) can intensify pain and cramping; for others, having a BM can reduce these symptoms.', 'Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with predominant diarrhea', 'Some people experience diarrhea as a main symptom of irritable bowel syndrome, passing loose, watery stools more than three times per day. In people with IBS, diarrhea may occur suddenly, particularly after encountering triggers of their symptoms. In cases of irritable bowel syndrome in which a person experiences diarrhea as one of their most prominent symptoms, the condition is sometimes called IBS-D. Altering a person’s diet is the first-line treatment for IBS-D, followed by prescribing medications.[4]', 'Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with predominant constipation', 'Those experiencing constipation as a symptom of IBS may pass fewer than three\nbowel movements per week. When it is passed, stool is often small and hard. When a person experiences constipation as one of the principal symptoms of their irritable bowel syndrome, this is sometimes called IBS-C.', 'Good to know: IBS-C shares many symptoms ‒ including bloating, abdominal pain and infrequent, difficult bowel movements ‒ with another common gastrointestinal disorder, chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC). Current research suggests that that IBS-C and CIC are different conditions, despite their significantly overlapping symptoms. If a person seeks medical attention for constipation, doctors will ensure that appropriate testing is undertaken so that a differential diagnosis can be made, as these conditions require different treatment approaches to relieve constipation.[5]', 'Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with constipation and diarrhea', 'When a person is equally affected by constipation and diarrhea as symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, this is called IBS-M (mixed irritable bowel syndrome) or IBS-A (alternating irritable bowel syndrome.', 'Rectal tenesmus', 'Rectal tenesmus involves cramping and spasms in the rectum. This leads to feeling that a bowel movement is incomplete, even if the bowel has actually been evacuated successfully. This feeling may lead to abdominal pain and cramping, associated with straining to bring about a bowel movement.', 'Good to know: Tenesmus is a symptom of many other gastrointestinal conditions, as well as a symptom of IBS. If a person seeks medical attention for rectal tenesmus, doctors will check for inflammation of the colon, to rule out a diagnosis such as ulcerative colitis (a form of IBD) or colon cancer.', 'Bloating and gas', 'Many people with IBS experience intense bloating (a sensation of increased abdominal pressure). This may or may not be due to an increased quantity of gas in the gastrointestinal tract; about 50 % of people experience increased abdominal pressure without a buildup of gas.[6]', 'Some people with irritable bowel syndrome also experience increased burping.', 'Mucus in stool', 'Passing mucus in the stool is a common symptom of IBS, but passing blood may indicate a more serious condition affecting the bowel, colon or gastrointestinal tract. Always seek medical attention for a prompt diagnosis if blood is present in bowel movements.', 'People experiencing any possible symptoms of IBS can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.']","['Despite ongoing research to determine definitive causes of IBS, these are still unclear. Contributing\nfactors may include infection, neurohormonal factors, food sensitivities and bacterial overgrowth. An individual’s psychological condition, hormone changes or stress levels are other possible causes.', 'Infection', 'It has been observed that some patients experience their first IBS symptoms after acute infectious\nenteritis. This so-called postinfectious IBS may be caused by viral, bacterial, protozoan or helminth\ninfection. Several research studies have shown that IBS symptoms can increase after infectious enteritis, but the actual cause of these symptoms requires further research.', 'Neurohormonal factors', 'Some people experience visceral hypersensitivity, which is a greater sensitivity to pain from the\norgans, including the stretching of the bowel as gas or stool passes through it. This may be linked\nto IBS symptoms including abdominal pain, urgent bowel movements, and bloating. However, the cause of this hypersensitivity is unknown.[7] It is also possible that the brain of a person with IBS\nprocesses pain differently than that of an unaffected person, or that other differences in the\nsignals passed between the brain and the intestinal tract are related to IBS.[8]', 'Neurotransmitters or reproductive hormones may be imbalanced in some people with IBS, and these may be affected by changes to an individual’s hormones, such as throughout the menstrual cycle. The possible role of sexual hormones in IBS may be supported by the fact that roughly twice as many women as men are affected in some countries.[9]', 'Food sensitivities', 'It has been observed that an individual with IBS may experience symptoms more often due to an\nintolerance of foods such as wheat; dairy products; fatty, creamy or fried foods; alliums such as\ngarlic or onions; stone fruits and other kinds of fruit; brassicae such as cabbage, cauliflower\nor Brussels sprouts; pulses such as lentils or beans and chili peppers.', 'Eliminating certain foods from the diet has been shown by some dietary studies to relieve the symptoms of IBS, but these foods vary according to the individual. More research on food sensitivities and their effect on IBS is required.', 'SIBO', 'Small intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is when too many of the gut’s naturally occurring\nbacteria accumulate in the small intestine. Some research has linked SIBO to IBS, and that\nantibiotic treatment has decreased IBS symptoms in some people with SIBO.[10] It is not clear\nfrom this research whether antibiotics affect the SIBO directly, or affect the IBS in a\ndifferent manner.', 'Malabsorption of fructose', 'In some people, IBS symptoms can be caused by the digestive system failing to absorb fructose effectively. Fructose is a kind of sugar found in fruits and some vegetables, and is often used as an artificial sweetener in processed foods. When fructose is not absorbed properly by the digestive system, it can ferment in the colon (large intestine). This can result in gastrointestinal symptoms such as gas, bloating and diarrhea.', 'For people whose IBS is believed to result from malabsorption of fructose, eating foods which are low in fructose may be helpful in reducing their symptoms. See this resource from the University of Virginia’s Digestive Health Centre for more information on low-fructose foods.', 'Additional factors', 'IBS is often linked to psychological factors such as stress, anxiety or depression, and stress\nmanagement is one possible treatment tool.

Some people experience\nanxiety around their IBS symptoms (known as GI symptom-specific anxiety), and may limit their\nexposure to activities and situations that would be affected by their IBS. This can increase\ntheir anxiety, creating a vicious cycle that increases their symptoms. Therapies like cognitive\nbehavioral therapy, psychotherapy, relaxation therapy, biofeedback and hypnotherapy may be used\nto help individuals both manage general stress and break this cycle.\nSelf-care to manage stress is another option, with common techniques including meditation,\nyoga and exercise.', 'IBS and diet', 'Each person has different dietary triggers for IBS. If sensitivity to specific foods is a trigger\nfor IBS symptoms, treatment may include reducing or eliminating these foods from the diet. Many people find it helpful to avoid high-FODMAP foods; FODMAP stands for: Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides And polyols; fermentable short-chain carbohydrates which are prevalent in a regular diet, which the small intestine does not absorb very well.[12]', 'Examples of low FODMAP foods which may ease symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome when included in a person’s diet include:[12]', 'Lactose-free or low-lactose dairy products, such as non-dairy milks, hard cheeses such as cheddar\nLow-fructose fruits such as oranges, kiwis and strawberries\nLow-fructan vegetables such as bean sprouts, carrots, eggplant, potatoes, olives, turnips\nProtein such as lean meat and tofu\nGluten-free grains', 'Examples of high FODMAP foods, which may aggravate symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, and should be excluded from one’s diet where possible, include:[12]', 'Lactose; cow’s milk, yoghurt, and cream\nFructose; fruits and products high in natural sugars from fruit, such as apples, pears, peaches, corn syrup\nFructans; vegetables and grains high in fructans include artichokes, garlic, onions, broccoli, beetroot and grains such as wheat and rye\nPolyols; sweeteners such as sorbitol and xylitol, found in sugar-free products', 'Another approach to alleviating symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome by changing one’s diet is to eat smaller, more frequent meals. Eating more slowly can reduce gas and bloating. Along with an individual’s possible food intolerances, foods commonly associated with abdominal cramping or diarrhea include coffee, caffeine, alcohol or high-fat foods, as well as poorly-digested sugars, such as sorbitol or fructose. Beans, raisins or breads can cause gas, and lactose intolerance can trigger IBS symptoms. Eating a high-fiber diet can improve stool quality and keep the GI tract healthy, but a diet excessively high in fiber can also cause gas and diarrhea.']"
['Ischemic Stroke'],"['Ischemic stroke occurs most often when a blood vessel supplying blood to the brain is blocked or obstructed by a blood clot or fatty deposit or any mix thereof. The brain relies on a constant supply of blood to provide it with oxygen and nutrients and to carry away carbon dioxide. When the blood flow, and therefore this supply, becomes interrupted or blocked, brain cells can quickly begin to stop working. If the blockage lasts for more than a couple of minutes, these cells can die, leading to serious damage to the brain.[1] Depending on the location and supply area of the affected vessel, the damage can range from mildly debilitating to severe or life-threatening.', 'There are two main types of stroke: the ischemic one introduced above, and the hemorrhagic one. Ischemic stroke is the most common, accounting for roughly 85 percent of all cases in the United States.[2] If prompt treatment is received, the effects of a stroke can be managed  in many cases. However, in some cases, ischemic stroke can lead to long-term disability and mortality, i.e. a person dying because of the condition.']","['In most cases, the symptoms of an ischemic stroke will appear suddenly, within seconds or minutes. Because people experiencing a stroke require immediate treatment, it is important to be aware of the immediate signs and symptoms and take action without delay.', 'A useful acronym for remembering the signs and symptoms of an ischemic stroke is FAST:[3][4]', '\nFace. Weakness or drooping of the face, usually limited to or more pronounced on one side.\nArm. Numbness, weakness or strange sensations, e.g. pins and needles, in one or both arms.\nSpeech. Difficulty speaking or slurred speech, mumbling or not being able to speak at all.\nTime to call the emergency services. The sooner an ambulance is called, the better the chances of a successful recovery.\n', 'Other symptoms of ischemic stroke may include:[5]', '\nWeakness or numbness on one side of the body\nDifficulty walking or getting up, e.g. from a chair or out of bed\nDropping to the floor\nHeadache\nDizziness\nSudden, new tinnitus - a ringing, swishing or whooshing sound in the ears\nNausea and vomiting\nSoreness in the neck or face\nVision problems, i.e. double vision or an inability to see parts of one’s surrounding or anything at all\nConfusion, sudden sleepiness, difficulty waking up\nSudden urinary incontinence, newly occurring with other symptoms\n', 'The symptoms that are experienced will depend on what part of the brain is affected and may vary in severity from person to person.']","['Ischemic stroke occurs when a blood vessel of the brain becomes blocked. This can happen as a result of several different conditions, including:[2][5]', 'Most commonly:', '\nAtherosclerosis\nSmall vessel disease\nAtrial fibrillation\n', 'In rarer cases:', '\nArterial dissection, e.g. due to trauma or fibromuscular dysplasia\nCertain blood clotting problems called coagulopathies, e.g. polycythemia or as a result of hormonal medications\nInflammation of the blood vessels, known as vasculitis, e.g. giant cell arteritis\nSickle cell disease\n', 'Atherosclerosis', 'A condition occurring when fatty deposits – called plaques or atheromas –  build up on the walls of the arteries, causing them to become narrower, harder and more easily blocked.', 'Small vessel disease', 'Small vessel disease involves the collection of deposits within the small blood vessels of the brain. As these deposits develop, the blood vessels become harder and can eventually become completely blocked. It occurs primarily as a result of high blood pressure and diabetes.[5]', 'Atrial fibrillation', 'Atrial fibrillation is a type of irregular heartbeat that can cause blood clots in the heart. These then enter the bloodstream and reach other parts of the body, e.g. the brain. If this happens, ischemic stroke can result.', 'Arterial dissection', 'Arterial dissection is a rarer cause of stroke. The condition occurs when tears in the lining of the arteries develop and blood is able to get in between the different layers of the artery wall. As blood builds up, a blood clot can form and lead to a stroke.', 'Coagulopathies', 'Though uncommon, certain blood clotting problems, where the blood clots too quickly, may cause a stroke. One example is polycythemia vera, a rare condition where the body produces too many red blood cells. This causes blood clots to form more easily - potentially leading to an ischemic stroke.[6][7]', 'Vasculitis', 'This is the term for an inflammation in the blood vessels, which may develop as the result of an infection, another health condition or an adverse reaction to medication. Vasculitis may cause the blood vessels to narrow or even become blocked, potentially leading to an ischemic stroke.[8] One type of vasculitis is giant cell arteritis, a condition that affects the arteries in the head and upper part of the body.[9]', 'Sickle cell disease', 'This genetic condition causes the shape of red blood cells to be abnormal. These red blood cells do not last very long, leading to anemia, and they can also block blood vessels - potentially leading to a stroke.[10][11]', 'Ischemic stroke risk factors', 'There are a number of factors which can increase a person’s likelihood of experiencing an ischemic stroke. These include factors which a person themselves or treatment can change over time, and factors that cannot be changed.[4][5]', 'Factors that can be changed over time (modifiable factors) include:[5]', '\nHigh blood pressure - this is the strongest single risk factor for the development of both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke\nAtherosclerosis (fatty deposits in the arteries)\nHypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol levels in the blood)\nDiabetes\nObesity and physical inactivity\nStress\nHigh alcohol consumption\nTobacco use\nIllicit (illegal) drug use\nCardiovascular (heart and heart vessel) diseases\nBlood clotting disorders\nOral contraceptives (birth control pills)\nPostmenopausal hormone intake\n', 'Factors that cannot be changed over time (non-modifiable factors) include:[5]', '\nBeing over the age of 40\nBeing male\nEthnicity - African Americans, Native Americans, Alaska Natives, and Hispanic people are at higher risk\nFamily history of stroke, heart or heart vessel conditions\nGenetic disorders, e.g. sickle cell disease\n', 'Recent childbirth also leads to a somewhat increased risk of stroke, due to an increased risk of blood clotting problems.', 'Although the above factors may make a stroke more likely, people who do not possess any risk factors may also experience a stroke.', 'Diagnosing ischemic stroke', 'Anyone displaying any signs of stroke should immediately be taken to a hospital emergency room for diagnosis. Typically, this will first involve a physical examination, that may include an ECG to rule out atrial fibrillation and a review of the person’s medical history, before a number of other scans and tests.[4]', 'Brain scans', 'Brain scans can help establish whether a stroke is ischemic or hemorrhagic, as well as its severity and the part of the brain affected. CT and MRI scans are the most commonly used types of scans for people suspected of having a stroke.[12][5]', '\nCT scans allow doctors to create a 3D image of the brain, enabling them to see what section of the brain is being affected and whether a stroke is ischemic or hemorrhagic. A CT scan is, in general, the best option (gold standard) and is quicker than an MRI scan. However, it may not be able to detect blood vessel blockages in the very early stages. Within the first 30 minutes of the blockage, an MRI will most likely produce more reliable results.\nMRI scans use radio waves and a strong magnetic field to build a detailed image of the interior of the body. In the first 30 minutes from the onset of stroke symptoms, an MRI may be able to detect blood vessel blockages and stroke damage more accurately than a CT scan.\n', 'Brain scans should be carried out as quickly as humanly possible when the person reaches the hospital, allowing for prompt and appropriate treatment to be received.', 'Heart and blood vessel tests', 'Various heart and blood vessel tests can be used to establish the cause of a stroke. Two of the most common are carotid ultrasound and echocardiography.', '\nCarotid ultrasound is able to identify any blockages or clots in the arteries running along the neck and leading to the brain.\nEchocardiography is a kind of ultrasound that can produce a detailed picture and provide certain measurements of the heart, enabling doctors to locate any issues that may have contributed to the stroke.\n', 'Ischemic stroke treatment', 'The aim of treatment for ischemic stroke is to restore blood flow as quickly as possible to the affected area of the brain. This will usually involve a combination of different medications while the person is being treated in the hospital and possibly others, once they are at home or at a rehabilitation facility. Some of these will only need to be taken for a short period of time, while others may be used to prevent future recurrences of stroke and will require long-term use.[13][14]', 'Some of the most commonly prescribed medications for treating an ischemic stroke include:', '\nAlteplase: A type of medication used to dissolve clots and restore blood flow to the brain. Alteplase is most effective when administered as soon as possible after the stroke has taken place. It will most often be given through a drip into a person’s veins, from where it will spread through the entire blood vessel system. Sometimes, the medication has to be given directly into an artery, close to the obstruction - this procedure is then called intra-arterial thrombolysis. Alteplase can only be used for ischemic strokes, not if there is bleeding into the brain - as in the case of a hemorrhagic stroke. To confirm that the stroke is indeed ischemic in nature, alteplase can only be prescribed following a brain scan.\nAntiplatelets: This type of medication helps to prevent further clots from forming. Aspirin is the most common antiplatelet, as well as a painkiller, though others, such as clopidogrel and dipyridamole, are also sometimes used.\nAnticoagulants: This type of medication, sometimes called blood thinners, includes drugs like warfarin or heparin and can be used to help reduce the chances of a stroke recurring by preventing blood clots from forming. Anticoagulants are sometimes also used in the acute treatment of a stroke.\n', 'Mechanical thrombectomy', 'In some cases, usually those involving a blood clot in one of the brain’s larger arteries, a procedure known as a mechanical thrombectomy may be used. During a thrombectomy, a catheter is inserted into the affected artery, through which a device, known as a stent retriever, is able to remove the clot in the artery in the brain. The procedure can be done under general or local anesthetic and is most effective when carried out shortly after the stroke has taken place. The procedure will usually be carried out in addition to IV thrombolytic therapy, e.g. with alteplase.', 'Ischemic stroke complications', 'A number of complications can arise in the days and weeks after a person has experienced a stroke, either while they are still in hospital or once they are at home or in a rehabilitation facility. These complications are important to recognize and treat in a timely manner, as they can, in some cases, lead to serious health problems and mortality (people dying from the condition).', 'Some of the most common complications include:[5]', 'Blood clots', 'While recovering from ischemic stroke, there is an increased risk of developing blood clots due to lack of moving around. This can be especially serious if a clot develops in the deep veins of the leg (deep vein thrombosis), breaks off and travels to the lungs. This can result in a condition known as pulmonary embolus or embolism, which can be potentially fatal. Older age and a lack of mobility during the recovery period increases the risk of deep vein thrombosis.', 'Doctors and physical therapists will advise on how to help prevent the development of blood clots. This may include the use of intermittent pneumatic compression devices, i.e. an inflatable sleeve that is wrapped around the legs, helping to increase circulation, compression stockings  and anticoagulant medication. People recovering from a stroke are also encouraged to move around frequently.', 'Dysphagia', 'Dysphagia refers to difficulty swallowing. This can occur after a stroke due to problems coordinating between the muscles of the tongue, mouth and throat. Dysphagia results in an increased risk of inhaling saliva or food into the lungs, which can lead to aspiration pneumonia, a condition that can worsen the prognosis of people who have had a stroke.', 'To determine whether a person is experiencing difficulty swallowing, doctors will typically perform a water test. This involves swallowing a small amount of water while being monitored. If dysphagia is suspected, people may be temporarily fed through a drip into the veins, a nasogastric feeding tube or, in rarer cases, a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube. Further details are provided below.', 'Nutrition', 'People recovering from a stroke often experience difficulty consuming enough calories. This can prolong the recovery period and in some cases lead to long-term disability. If it is suspected that a person will not be able consume enough calories themselves, a type of feeding tube known as a nasogastric tube (NGT)may be fitted through the nose. Through this tube, food and necessary nutrients can be supplied directly to the stomach as a short-term solution. In some cases, a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube may need to be fitted through the abdomen (belly) as a longer-term feeding solution.[15][16]', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urinary tract infections are a common complication of a stroke. This is generally because people in recovery often experience difficulty with getting out of bed to urinate, bladder leakage and problems fully emptying their bladders. Depending on the type of stroke, temporary use of a catheter may be recommended to decrease the risk of urinary tract infection. However, the use of a catheter comes with its own risk of urinary tract infection, meaning most people are advised to only use a catheter when necessary and to change the catheter regularly.', 'Heart problems', 'Heart abnormalities seem to be quite common in people who have had a stroke. Though often difficult to do so, in the interests of effective care, it is important to identify whether the heart problems led to the stroke, resulted from the stroke, or are entirely unrelated, and treat them accordingly to minimize the risk of further complications. Through an electrocardiogram (ECG), blood tests and monitoring, doctors are able to determine the potential risk of heart problems and recommend appropriate treatment options.[17]', 'Bed sores', 'Bed sores are common in people recovering from a stroke due to the large amount of time spent in bed. Bed sores can vary in severity from mild redness to deep sores extending down to the bone. Bed sores can cause severe irritation and increase the risk of infection.', 'Frequent movement, which may need to be assisted, is recommended to prevent the development of bed sores. Care should also be taken to avoid pressure on sensitive areas such as the knees, ankles and heels.', 'Falls', 'People recovering from a stroke may experience difficulty walking. Lack of movement can increase the risk of bone thinning and muscle weakness, which can in turn increase the chances of falling and breaking a bone. To help prevent this, people will often be encouraged to partake in muscle strengthening exercises and rehabilitation appropriate to their condition.', 'Ischemic stroke prevention', 'Although some of the risk factors of a stroke – such as family history and being over the age of 40 – are uncontrollable, other risk factors can be managed to help decrease the chances of a stroke. These risk factors include:[18]', '\nHigh blood pressure If a person’s blood pressure is outside the normal range, steps can be taken to help bring it down. These steps may include maintaining a healthy weight, exercising and eating healthily. If these measures are not sufficient and it is deemed necessary by a medical professional, taking appropriate medication against hypertension may also be recommended.\nSmoking: Quitting smoking reduces the risk of stroke. Doctors and specialists are able to recommend supportive measures, e.g. structured programs and/or medications to help people quit.\nHeart problems: Heart disorders, such as coronary artery disease and irregular heartbeat (atrial fibrillation), increase the risk of stroke. People with such a heart problem should seek medical attention. Treatment for these heart problems will help reduce the chances of stroke.\nDiabetes: Receiving proper treatment for diabetes type 2, as well as type 1, is helpful in preventing a stroke.\nObesity/inactivity: A sedentary, inactive and nutritionally unhealthy lifestyle leading to obesity is strongly linked to heart problems, diabetes and high blood pressure. Maintaining a healthy weight and leading an active lifestyle is an effective way of helping to prevent a stroke.\n', 'Ischemic stroke FAQs', 'Q: What is the difference between an ischemic stroke and a hemorrhagic stroke?\nA: An ischemic stroke occurs when a blood vessel leading to the brain becomes blocked or obstructed. This is the most common type of stroke, accounting for roughly 85 percent of all cases. A hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a weakened blood vessel ruptures, usually as a result of high blood pressure.[19]', '', '\n\nStroke Center. “Ischemic Stroke.” Accessed December 18, 2017. ↩\n\nStroke Association. “Ischemic stroke.” September 2017.

Alteplase can only be used for ischemic strokes, not if there is bleeding into the brain - as in the case of a hemorrhagic stroke. To confirm that the stroke is indeed ischemic in nature, alteplase can only be prescribed following a brain scan.\nAntiplatelets: This type of medication helps to prevent further clots from forming. Aspirin is the most common antiplatelet, as well as a painkiller, though others, such as clopidogrel and dipyridamole, are also sometimes used.\nAnticoagulants: This type of medication, sometimes called blood thinners, includes drugs like warfarin or heparin and can be used to help reduce the chances of a stroke recurring by preventing blood clots from forming. Anticoagulants are sometimes also used in the acute treatment of a stroke.\n', 'Mechanical thrombectomy', 'In some cases, usually those involving a blood clot in one of the brain’s larger arteries, a procedure known as a mechanical thrombectomy may be used. During a thrombectomy, a catheter is inserted into the affected artery, through which a device, known as a stent retriever, is able to remove the clot in the artery in the brain. The procedure can be done under general or local anesthetic and is most effective when carried out shortly after the stroke has taken place. The procedure will usually be carried out in addition to IV thrombolytic therapy, e.g. with alteplase.']"

['Late Lyme Disease'],"['Lyme disease, also known as Lyme borreliosis, is caused by an infection with the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi. This bacteria is disseminated through tick bites. Infected ticks usually bite small mammals, who do not develop any kind of infection from the bacteria. When humans are exposed to B. Burgdorferi from a tick bite, however, they can develop Lyme disease.[1]', 'People who work outside or spend time in woodland areas, where there is greater potential for exposure to tick bites, are most at risk of infection.', 'Lyme disease is a condition which progresses in stages:', '\nA person will initially develop early localized lyme disease, in which the bacteria have not yet spread through the body. At this stage, which generally has its onset days or weeks after the tick bite, a person’s symptoms will usually include a fever, fatigue, and a rash, called the Erythema Migrans rash,[2] which has a distinctive bulls’ eye shape and affects around two thirds of people who develop Lyme disease. See this resource for more information on symptoms and treatment of early localized Lyme disease.\nIf early localized Lyme disease is not successfully treated with antibiotics, such as doxycycline, in time, it will develop into early disseminated Lyme disease, spreading to other areas of the body. If this occurs, other oral or intravenous antibiotics will be needed; oral antibiotics will be used in cases which are considered less severe. See this resource for more information on symptoms and treatment of early disseminated Lyme disease.\nIf Lyme disease is not diagnosed in either of these early stages, and is not treated effectively with antibiotics,[3] the bacteria that cause LD can spread throughout the body from the site of the tick bite, resulting in late disseminated Lyme disease, or late lyme disease. The onset of symptoms and complications of late disseminated Lyme disease is usually around 6-36 months after the original infection.\n', 'Good to know: People affected by late lyme disease may develop other subtypes of late lyme disease, such as post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS) or chronic Lyme disease.', 'Symptoms of late Lyme disease may include joint pain (arthritis), skin changes, musculoskeletal or neurologic complications. Like the less severe forms of Lyme disease, late Lyme disease can be treated with antibiotics, although medical opinions differ about the appropriate length of an antibiotic treatment course.[3] Regardless, most people recover well, although some symptoms associated with late Lyme disease, such as fatigue, may persist for some time following treatment.', 'People experiencing possible symptoms of late Lyme disease can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.']","['Late Lyme disease usually develops 6-36 months after a person first receives the causal infectious tick bite.', 'The symptoms of late Lyme disease differ from the earlier stages. In North America, joint pain and swelling is very common. In Europe, skin changes are more common. These skin changes consist of swelling, redness and thinning of the skin on usually one hand or one foot.

When the condition is in its early stages, e.g. when the Erythema Migrans rash is present, a short course of antibiotics may be sufficient to stop the bacterial infection spreading to other parts of the body.', 'Late Lyme disease often requires antibiotic treatment over a period of up to 28 days. Sometimes these antibiotics must be administered intravenously (through a drip).']"
['Legionella Infection'],"[""Legionella infection, or Legionnaire's disease, is a infection of the airways or lungs with a bacteria called Legionella. It is usually caused by breathing in the bacteria in droplets of contaminated water. Older people and people with a weak immune system are most commonly affected. Legionella infections can cause a pneumonia, and cause symptoms such as fever, weakness, joint pain, shortness of breath, chest pain and a cough. Diagnosis is usually made with a chest X-ray and identification of the Legionella bacteria in phlegm or urine. Antibiotics are needed to treat the infection. If appropriate therapy is started early, most people recover well, but this depends on the health and age of the affected person.""]","['Symptoms of a Legionella infection include headache, fever, chills, body aches and feeling generally ill.

Oxygen with breathing machine and fluids through veins might be needed.']"
['Liver Cirrhosis'],"[""Liver cirrhosis occurs when a long-term medical condition causes the liver to form scar tissue. This scar tissue replaces the normal, healthy liver, and causes the liver to become less effective. This causes problems with blood flow through the liver and interferes with the liver's other functions. There are many possible causes of liver cirrhosis, but the most common causes are hepatitis, fatty liver disease, and long-term, heavy alcohol use. Diagnosis may involve multiple tests to investigate the remaining ability of the liver and the cause of the damage. Treatment involves managing the underlying cause and preventing further damage to the liver. It is important to reduce or stop drinking alcohol, and to keep to a low-protein diet. There is no cure for liver cirrhosis, but good management can slow down the scarring process and stop the condition from progressing.""]","['The typical symptoms include tiredness, itchy skin, tremor, a loss of appetite, weight and muscle loss, yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice), small spider-shaped blood vessels on the skin, and swelling of the legs and abdomen. As the condition progresses, people may become confused, forgetful and drowsy. The symptoms of liver cirrhosis occur when the liver is scarred and not able to let blood flow freely through or perform the functions that it should. For this reason, symptoms usually only occur in the later stages of cirrhosis.']",,"['The treatment depends on the causes of liver cirrhosis and the stage of the liver damage at the time of diagnosis. Common measures include reducing alcohol intake, taking lactulose and eating a low protein diet. If there is an underlying cause, it should be treated or managed. Other procedures may be needed to investigate or treat the complications. The last resort in cases of total liver failure is liver transplantation.']"
['Lower Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage'],"['Lower gastrointestinal tract bleeding is a condition in which there is bleeding from the lower part of the digestive system, specifically the large bowel, the rectum or the anus. The main symptoms are either fresh red blood passed from the anus or maroon-colored bowel movements. Massive bleeding from the lower gastrointestinal tract is a medical emergency. Elderly people and people with a history of diverticular disease, inflammatory bowel disease and colon or rectum cancer develop this condition more commonly. The treatment depends upon the cause of the bleeding, but almost always includes replacement of fluid and blood and, if possible, finding the source and stopping the bleeding.']","['The most common symptom is bright red blood passed from the anus or in the stool. Other symptoms may include abdominal pain, dizziness, a fast and pounding heart, weakness, confusion and collapse, depending upon how much blood is lost.']",,"['Treatment depends on the amount of blood loss and the cause of the bleed. The cause should be investigated and treated to avoid further bleeding. If there has been a small bleed, these can be managed with medical or endoscopic therapy. If there has been severe blood loss, treatment includes hospitalization and resuscitation of the affected person. This may require fluids through a drip or blood transfusions, in addition to monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, etc. People who have large bleeds may need emergency surgery to find and treat the cause of the bleed.']"
['Lyme Disease'],"['Lyme disease (LD), also known as Lyme borreliosis, is a condition caused by an infection with the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi, which is spread through the bites of infected blacklegged ticks.', 'The World Health Organisation classifies LD as an infectious or parasitic disease. People who work outside or spend time in woodland areas are most likely to be affected.  In the United States, about 30,000 cases of Lyme disease are reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention every year.', 'Subtypes of Lyme disease', 'There are three subtypes of Lyme disease.', 'Early LD tends to cause symptoms in one location first, this is called localized Lyme disease, and then spreads slowly through the body. This is called disseminated Lyme disease.', 'The third type of LD, late Lyme disease tends to be slightly more common in children and older adults.']","['The symptoms of Lyme disease may differ, depending on whether a person has early LD or late LD. The trademark feature of Lyme disease is the erythema migrans rash, a distinctive skin irritation shaped like a bull’s eye. Its presence is proof of LD. This rash usually appears at the site of a tick bite, but can appear elsewhere on the body.', 'Good to know: A tick bite itself is not an indication of Lyme disease.', 'Early LD', 'In localized LD, the erythema migrans rash takes the form of an inflammation, surrounded by a circular border of non-irritated skin, followed by a final, circular border of irritated skin. It can increase to up to 30 centimetres in diameter and can be painful or itchy.', 'The rash appears on average 11 to 18 days after the tick has detached or was removed. It is possible to have more than one bull’s eye rash on the body, but it is also possible to contract LD without developing the rash, which only appears in 60 to 80 percent of people who have been infected with LD.', 'Besides the rash, the symptoms at the onset of Lyme disease may be similar to flu. Early symptoms of LD include:', '\nAching muscles\nCold flushes\nFatigue\nFever\nPainful joints\n', 'As the bacteria begin to spread, a person can develop disseminated LD. This usually occurs if the early symptoms of LD are not spotted or treated and the infection continues to be present in a person’s body for 1-4 months.[1]', 'Symptoms of disseminated LD may include more rashes appearing on other parts of the skin to accompany the initial, circular rash at the site of the tick bite and painful, swollen joints. More rarely, affected people may experience neurological problems at this stage, such as difficulty concentrating. Feeling unwell? Get a free symptom assessment by downloading the Ada app.', 'Late LD', 'Late Lyme disease usually develops 6 to 36 months after the infectious tick bite. Later symptoms can vary from person to person, but include further pain and swelling in the joints. Although some people may develop neurological problems, these are rare. They may include tingling or numbness in the hands and feet.[2]', 'Weeks or months after infection has occurred, people may also experience complications with their central nervous system.', 'Read more about Late Lyme Disease »']","['Lyme disease is primarily transmitted through the infectious bites of immature blacklegged ticks called nymphs, which feed during the spring and summer months. Ticks wait in grass and plants and cling to the fur or clothing of animals or humans as they pass by. They then bite into the skin, where they anchor themselves firmly and begin feeding. Ticks must be attached for at least 36 to 48 hours before the Lyme disease bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi can be transmitted.', 'Although ticks can feed anywhere on the body, they prefer thin-skinned areas which are more easily punctured such as the groin, armpits and behind the ears. The bacterium that causes a person to develop Lyme disease is also carried by adult ticks, but they tend to be easier to spot than nymphs and are likely to be removed before infection occurs.', 'Lyme disease is not thought to be spread by human-to-human contact. For example, people cannot get infected by close bodily contact with somebody who is suffering from Lyme disease.[3] Although animals can contract LD, there is no evidence that it can be passed on to a human from an infected animal, without the involvement of a tick. However, domestic pets, especially dogs, can bring humans into contact with LD by carrying infected ticks in their fur.']","['Most cases of Lyme disease can be treated with oral antibiotics. These most commonly include amoxicillin, cefuroxime or doxycycline. Early treatment of LD is most likely to be successful and the majority of people who are diagnosed promptly with LD, and treated early, recover well. However, a small number of people continue to present symptoms despite using antibiotics.', 'Monitoring Recovery', 'After being prescribed antibiotics for Lyme disease, it is advisable to closely monitor one’s symptoms as they improve in order to ensure that the recovery process is underway. It is advisable to visit the doctor and to repeat blood tests for IgG antibodies to confirm that the Lyme disease has been treated effectively.']"
['Malaria'],"['Malaria is a serious disease which occurs almost exclusively in the tropics and subtropics. It is caused by infection with a parasite called Plasmodium, which is spread through the bite of female mosquitoes that carry it.[1]', 'The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that about half the world’s population were at risk in 2016.[2] Most cases of malaria occur in those who live in or have visited sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. However, the Eastern Mediterranean, Oceania, and the Americas are also risk areas.', 'In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report approximately 1700 cases of malaria annually.[3]', 'The main symptoms of malaria are fever and a flu-like illness.

However, it has an excellent prognosis if diagnosed early and treated appropriately.', 'Malaria is typically preventable with the use of antimalarial drugs when a person visits endemic areas. Mosquito repellent and insect nets should be used during the night, since the mosquitoes that transmit malaria bite mainly during the night.', 'Symptoms usually appear within a couple of weeks of becoming infected, but can sometimes take much longer. The period may vary, depending on host factors and the causative species, so malaria disease should be considered as a possible diagnosis in all cases of fever within a year of visiting an affected area.']","['Malaria symptoms typically manifest within a few weeks after infection, although the host’s previous exposure or immunity to malaria will affect their symptoms and incubation period. In some cases, the parasite may lie dormant and not cause symptoms for many months, even up to a year after traveling in an area where malaria is present.', 'Main symptoms of malaria', 'Signs and symptoms of malaria typically include:[4]', '\nPiques of very high fever\nShaking chills\nSweats\n', 'Paroxysms – sudden recurrences or attacks of fever, shaking chills and sweats together – occur every 24, 48 or 72 hours, depending on the parasite species. Each paroxysm lasts approximately one to two hours and occurs in three successive stages. The first is characterized by shivering and a feeling of cold. This is followed by a pique of high fever. After the patient experiences excessive sweating to an unusual degree, the temperature goes back to normal or even below normal. Sometimes, in early infection, patients don’t experience this, but may have several piques of fever during the day.', '\nHeadache\nCough\nFatigue\nArthralgia (painful joints)\nMuscle pain\n', 'Less common symptoms of malaria', 'In some cases, a person may also experience:[5]', '\nAbdominal pain\nLethargy, meaning sleeplessness or deep unresponsiveness and inactivity\nNausea\nVomiting\nDiarrhea, especially in children\nAnemia\nJaundice\nShortness of breath\nLoss of appetite\n', 'Life-threatening complications can result from malaria if it is left untreated or if it is malignant malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum. This may include respiratory distress, liver failure, kidney failure and shock, as well as very serious brain and central nervous system problems.', 'Often, abdominal pain occurs in the first week or two of malaria. This is caused mostly by inflammation of the liver and spleen. Large numbers of red blood cells become sequestered in the liver and the spleen, as well as other major organs. If the spleen becomes very enlarged, it may rupture, causing massive internal bleeding that requires emergency treatment.[6]']","['Human malaria is caused by a parasite known as Plasmodium, specifically species P. falciparum, P. malariae, P. ovale, P. vivax and P. knowlesi, which is normally spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. Just one bite from an infected mosquito can lead to malaria.', 'Only female Anopheles mosquitoes can transmit malaria. When a mosquito bites an infected person, it takes in a small amount of blood, which contains microscopic malaria parasites. About one week later, when the mosquito takes its next blood meal, these parasites mix with the mosquito’s saliva and are injected into the person being bitten.', 'Not every infectious mosquito bite will result in malaria. The number of parasites each mosquito carries influences the chance of successful malaria infection. Some mosquitoes can be highly infected, making them particularly likely to pass on the disease.[7]', 'Mosquito-transmitted malaria also depends on certain climatic features, such as sufficiently high temperatures and humidity for Anopheles mosquitoes to multiply and survive. This is why malaria occurs in warmer, tropical areas.', 'Hot weather also encourages human behavior that can increase contact with Anopheles mosquitoes between dusk and dawn, the time when malaria-causing mosquitoes mostly bite. Examples include outside activities like camping, sleeping outside and also wearing light and short clothes that lead to more skin being uncovered and more exposed to a possible mosquito bite.', 'In rare cases, malaria transmission can occur from person to person, without requiring passage through a mosquito. This can only occur through blood, such as in the following scenarios:', '\nOrgan transplants\nBlood transfusions\nNeedle sharing\nFrom mother to unborn child in congenital malaria\n', 'Cases of infection secondary to transfusion of infected blood are extremely rare.[8]']","['It may be possible to treat malaria at home if symptoms are mild. However, if the infection is caused by Plasmodium falciparum or there are any complications, the person will generally need to be treated and monitored in a hospital.', 'If promptly diagnosed and treated, most people will make a full recovery from malaria. However, treatment may make a person feel weak and tired for several weeks after the infection is gone.', 'There are various types of antimalarial medication available. Which medication is prescribed to treat malaria will depend on:', '\nThe subtype of plasmodium parasite causing it\nWhether any antimalarial medications have been taken when traveling\nThe severity of symptoms\n', 'More than one type of medication, or an alternative, may be given if a person experiences side-effects, or if the infecting parasite shows resistance to a particular drug.', ""Many of the same medications used to prevent malaria can also be used to treat the disease.

As other symptoms begin earlier, affected people usually feel most unwell on the first or second day that the rash is present.', 'Symptoms of measles usually begin to appear on average around seven to 14 days after  becoming infected.[6] However, affected people are usually infectious four days before to four days after the measles rash appears.[4]', 'Overall, most people with measles feel better within seven to 10 days of first experiencing symptoms. On occasion, a dry cough may persist after all other symptoms have gone.[8] Check your symptoms with the Ada app.', 'During the measles infection, the immune system builds up a resistance to the virus.

The treating doctor can give the best advice on treatment in individual cases.""]"
['Melatonin'],"['Melatonin is a natural hormone which plays an important role in regulating the body’s circadian rhythm, otherwise known as the sleep/wake cycle.[1] Melatonin production is at its highest at night, typically between the hours of 11pm and 3am, dropping off significantly during the day. Melatonin production is also affected by the seasons, with the hormone being produced earlier in the darker winter months and later in the summer.[2]', 'In this way, melatonin helps to promote sleep at night and wakefulness during the day. The hormone’s function has led it to be nicknamed the sleep hormone.', 'How is melatonin produced and controlled?', 'The majority of melatonin is produced in the pineal gland of the brain, though smaller quantities are also made in other tissues of the body. Melatonin is released into the bloodstream and circulates throughout the body, where its presence is detected by receptors. These receptors then signal to the body that it is time to sleep.', 'The production of melatonin is controlled by the circadian clock, which is located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei region of the brain. This is a tiny region of the brain in the hypothalamus, situated directly above the optic chiasm. The suprachiasmatic nuclei region is connected to the pineal gland through the nervous system.', 'The circadian clock is regulated primarily by light received through the eyes, which tells it when and when not to signal for melatonin production. The circadian clock conveys to the rest of the body whether it is light or dark outside; information which accordingly sets off various functional processes, including the body’s sleep-wake timing, blood pressure regulation, seasonal reproduction (reproductive cycle) and core temperature regulation.[3]', 'The body’s natural production of melatonin occurs when it is dark. Accordingly, melatonin levels typically begin increasing in the late evening, and maximum melatonin levels are usually reached between 2:00 and 4:00 a.m. Levels of melatonin decline slowly thereafter, becoming barely detectable in the daytime. This cycle repeats every day; the body’s rhythm is kept to an approximate 24 hour cycle by the circadian clock, which roughly correlates with the light/dark cycle of nature.[3]', 'What are melatonin supplements used for?', 'Melatonin is also available in synthetic form, typically as a capsule. Synthetic melatonin is able to reset the body’s circadian rhythm and bring on feelings of tiredness, making it a commonly prescribed supplement for those experiencing:[4][5]', '\nInsomnia or jet lag\nBenzodiazepine or nicotine withdrawal, facilitating a calmer tolerance of the withdrawal period\nCancer adjuvant care, a care-plan alongside treatment for cancer[6]\nHeadaches, as a preventative medication\nShift-work disorder\nSleep disorders\nThrombocytopenia, which may be caused by chemotherapy\nWinter depression\nDyskinesia, a disorder in which people experience uncontrolled, involuntary movement\n', 'Taken as a supplement, synthetic melatonin mimics the effects of the naturally produced version of the hormone. Supplementary melatonin is principally used by those experiencing insomnia, those with jet lag and those with delayed sleep phase syndrome, i.e.when the circadian rhythm is out of sync with the day/night cycle. However, it is important to note that the use of melatonin supplements does not guarantee the ability to sleep, and that a healthcare professional should always be consulted before beginning use.[7]', 'Good to know: Melatonin will not be prescribed to treat insomnia if a cause can be identified. In all cases where a medical, mental or environmental cause for insomnia is discerned, the causal issue(s) will be addressed as a first line treatment.', 'When not to take melatonin supplements', 'Pregnant or breastfeeding women should not take melatonin, nor should those with an autoimmune disorder, a seizure disorder or depression. If a person is younger than 20 years old, the use of melatonin supplements should be discussed with a doctor prior to taking them. Those with high blood pressure, impaired liver function or diabetes should always consult a doctor before beginning to use melatonin.', 'Melatonin may react with other medications. For this reason, it is always recommended that a person check with their doctor before using melatonin supplements at the same time as taking other medications. In particular, a person should be closely monitored in case of drug interactions if they are using medications including:', '\nAnticoagulant (anti blood-clotting) medication\nConcurrent immunosuppressive treatment\nAny medication used on a chronic (long-term) basis\n', 'People using melatonin should stop if the supplement does not work after a week or two of use. Generally, melatonin supplementation should be considered a short-term rather than a long-term solution to problems with sleep. People experiencing recurrent or severe sleeping disorders should seek the advice of a doctor, who will present other therapeutic options in the event that melatonin supplementation does not provide relief.', 'How to take melatonin', 'In the US, melatonin is available without a prescription from pharmacies and health food stores. In the EU, a doctor’s prescription will be required in all cases. Elsewhere, a doctor’s prescription may also be required to ensure that the supplement is safe for the person to use and to diagnose any possible underlying conditions that are causing sleep problems.', 'Doses of melatonin should be somewhere between 0.5 and 5 mg, with research suggesting that there is little difference in the effectiveness of a larger dose. Most melatonin supplements come in slow/release form, meaning they work gradually throughout the night, mimicking how the body naturally releases the hormone.', 'It is generally recommended that melatonin should be taken one or two hours before bed, though some people will experience a wave of tiredness roughly 20 minutes after taking it. If used to combat jet lag, the supplement should be taken close to bedtime at the destination.[8]', 'Melatonin side-effects', 'Melatonin is generally described as safe when taken in the short-term. Despite this, the advice of a doctor should always be sought before beginning to use the supplement.', 'Possible side-effects of taking melatonin supplements may include:[9]', '\nDrowsiness during the day (daytime fatigue)\nAbdominal cramps\nDecreased alertness\nIrritability or feelings of depression (transient)\nDysphoria in patients who are already depressed\nStomach pain\nHeadache\nDizziness\n', 'Immediate medical attention should be sought if any of the following signs occur, as they may be signs of an allergic reaction:', '\nDifficulty breathing\nHives\nSwelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat\n', 'Other signs that a person may require medical attention include:', '\nDysphoria, i.e a profound state of unease or dissatisfaction\nUnresponsiveness to stimuli\n', '', '\n\nNational Sleep Foundation. “What is Circadian Rhythm.” Accessed September 15, 2017. ↩\n\nDrugs. “Melatonin.” February 26, 2017.

['Menopause'],"['The menopause transition period, which is also known as perimenopause, is the period of time during which a woman moves beyond her childbearing years and enters menopause. Menopause itself is when a woman has not had a menstrual period for more than one year. During menopause transition, women often experience a change in menstrual cycles, vaginal dryness, hot flashes or flushes and sleeping problems. The experience of the symptoms can vary greatly from mild to unbearable and can cause severe interference with daily activities and sleep. The perimenopause usually lasts around five years. The symptoms are often treated with lifestyle changes and hormonal therapies. Although the symptoms should eventually peter out as one enters the menopause, troublesome symptoms which persist can be managed, and should be discussed with a doctor.']","['The most typical symptom of the menopause transition are menstrual periods which are different from the regular menstrual cycle. These may become heavier or lighter, and tend to come further apart until they eventually stop. Other common symptoms include hot flashes or flushes, sweating at night, difficulty sleeping, weight change, mood swings, a low mood, a low sex drive, vaginal dryness and tender breasts. Symptoms can vary from mild to unbearable and can cause severe interference with daily activities.']",,"['The treatment of this condition involves managing the symptoms. Many women find that lifestyle changes, such as taking regular exercise, reducing caffeine and alcohol intake, eating a healthy diet and staying social help to manage symptoms. Hormonal therapies may help with the irregular bleeding and the mood symptoms. This includes hormone replacement therapy. Using lubricants or estrogen-containing creams may help with vaginal dryness. There are many herbal remedies that are marketed as being helpful for peri-menopausal symptoms. Some of these can interact with other medications, so it is wise to discuss the use of these with a doctor or pharmacist.', 'Other names for menopause', '\nMenopause transition\nPerimenopause\n']"
['Mesothelioma'],"['Mesothelioma is a type of cancer that develops in the layers of tissue that surround the\ninternal organs (the mesothelium). The lining of the lungs (the pleura) is the most commonly\naffected area, but the cancer can also develop in the tissue in the abdomen that surrounds\nthe digestive organs (the peritoneum), the lining of the heart and the tissue that surrounds\nthe testicles.[1]', 'Mesothelioma typically develops slowly, manifesting itself in symptoms such as extreme\ntiredness, fever, shortness of breath, chest pain, a persistent cough, nausea, abdominal\npain, swelling or weight loss.[2]', 'The majority of mesothelioma cases are a result of exposure to asbestos, a once common\nbuilding material that is now known to be highly toxic. The more exposure to asbestos, the\ngreater the risk of the cancer. Roughly five times more men than women are diagnosed with\nmesothelioma and around half of all cases occur in individuals 75 years of age or older. It\nis a fairly rare type of cancer, with around 3,000 reported cases in the USA each year.[3]', 'There is no known cure for mesothelioma and treatment can be challenging. Life expectancy,\ntherefore, is often limited to between several months and several years after the initial\ndiagnosis.']","['The symptoms of mesothelioma can be difficult to detect due to their similarity the symptoms\nof other, more common, conditions. They can also be very slow to develop, making them\npotentially unnoticeable in the condition’s early stages.

The link\nbetween asbestos and mesothelioma, therefore, is considered indisputable by healthcare\nprofessionals.', 'Asbestos is a naturally occurring mineral which has been known of since antiquity and mined\nsince the early 19th century, though it was only in the latter half of the 20th century that\nit became a common building material. Although researchers discovered a link between asbestos\nand cancer as early as the late 1940s, the extent of its dangers did not become common\nknowledge until much later and it was only banned in the USA in 1989.[4]', 'Those with a history of long-term exposure to asbestos are most at risk of being diagnosed\nwith mesothelioma. However, cases have also been reported of mesothelioma in individuals\nwho were only exposed to the material for a relatively short period of time (1-3 months).', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Statistically, populations living close to naturally occurring asbestos deposits are at far\nhigher risk of developing mesothelioma than those who do not. Naturally occurring asbestos\nis found across the globe, including in the United States, Canada and South Africa. Forty\npercent of the world’s asbestos is mined in Russia, with large amounts also mined in China\nand Kazakhstan.', 'When the earth is mined or construction work undertaken, the asbestos is disturbed, releasing\nparticles into the air and exposing large areas to the risk of inadvertent inhalation.', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Working with asbestos, particularly in the construction and mining industries, has been\nproven to vastly increase one’s risk of developing a number of diseases, including malignant\nmesothelioma. Despite asbestos now being banned, the risk of exposure still exists when\ndealing with buildings built before the banning order took effect. The use of masks and\nartificial respiratory systems has been shown to greatly reduce the risks posed.']","['There currently exists no cure for mesothelioma, however there are treatments available\nthat can help prolong life expectancy and improve quality of life. These typically involve\na combination of surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. In some cases, emerging or\nexperimental treatments may also be prescribed.[5] The direction that treatment will take\nis largely determined by the maturity of the cancer, the age and general health of the\npatient, as well as how far the cancer has spread (this will depend on what stage the cancer\nhas entered – see the prognosis section for more details on the stages of mesothelioma).', 'Surgery', 'If the cancer has been detected early, surgery will involve fully removing the tumor(s) —\nor, depending on where the cancer is located — the mesothelial lining, lymph nodes or sections\nof the lungs or heart. However, if the cancer is more developed, this may be impossible and\nsurgery will typically be paired with chemotherapy or radiation therapy — a treatment route\nthat has proven effective in combatting malignant mesothelioma.', 'Chemotherapy', 'Courses of chemotherapy have proven the most effective treatment method in combatting\nmesothelioma in controlled testing. Chemotherapy drugs work by halting the multiplication\nof cancerous cells in the body and thereby stopping the spread of the disease and the\ndevelopment of tumors.[6] There are more than 100 types of chemotherapy drugs currently\navailable on the market, with each differentially effective in treating patients in different\nstages of the disease.', 'Chemotherapy can result in significant side-effects, most commonly vomiting, stomatitis,\nexhaustion and diarrhea. Typically, the chemotherapy drugs are administered intravenously\nin cycles of several weeks followed by a short recuperation break. To lessen the side-effects\nand more directly target specific tumors, doctors have pioneered a method of localized\nchemotherapy whereby the drug is injected straight into the tumor itself. While this method\nhas proven effective in combatting early-stage mesothelioma, it is not suitable for tackling\nthe disease once it has spread from its original location.', 'Radiation Therapy', 'If the cancer remains localized and the patient is in otherwise good health, radiation\ntherapy, in conjunction with surgery and sometimes chemotherapy as well, can be an effective\ntreatment method. It has been shown to significantly improve a patient’s prognosis, however,\nit is considered a radical option that can result in serious side-effects. These can include\npneumonitis; a condition that involves the inflammation of the alveoli (air sacs) in the\nlungs that can sometimes be fatal in itself.', 'Emerging Treatments', 'If surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy prove ineffective, some patients may be\neligible for emerging treatments in their clinical trial stage. These treatment options are\nthose that have not yet been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and are\ntherefore considered experimental.', 'One such promising treatment method is immunotherapy. This type of treatment harnesses the\npower of the bodies own immune system, training it to specifically attack the cancerous\ncells and leave the healthy cells alone. This is done by introducing antigens (substances\nthe body recognises as toxic) into the body, stimulating and improving the immune system’s\nresponse to their presence. When used in addition to conventional methods, immunotherapy\nhas seen some success in improving life expectancies.', 'Across the world, numerous clinical trials are taking place on new drugs for treatment of\nmesothelioma. These new, cutting-edge drugs promise to advance the treatment of the cancer\nand improve the prognosis of patients. New drugs take years to be tested and become\navailable on the market, though patients with particularly severe cases may be eligible\nfor inclusion on these clinical trials.']"
['Middle Ear Infection'],"['A middle ear infection, otherwise known as otitis media, is a viral or bacterial infection of the air-filled cavity behind the eardrum. In most cases, a middle ear infection affects just one ear, but can also occur in both ears simultaneously. The infection can cause painful inflammation, as well as a build-up of fluid in the middle ear. Although people of any age can develop the infection, it is most common in younger children, with a high percentage of children experiencing the condition before the age of 10.[1]', 'In some cases, a middle ear infection may disappear without treatment. While antibiotics are only sometimes necessary to fight the infection, pain-relievers are commonly prescribed to lessen the pain caused by the condition. Further treatment options are available for recurrent middle ear infections. Complications are rare, meaning it is generally considered a non-serious condition.', 'There are three common types of middle ear infection:', '\nAcute otitis media: This is the most common form. It is characterised by its rapid onset and often results in ear pain, fever and hearing impairment. It usually lasts for between a few days and a few weeks.\nOtitis media with effusion: Once the initial infection has faded, non-infectious fluid or mucus may continue to build, resulting in pronounced hearing loss and a feeling of fullness in the ear. Otitis media with effusion can also result from a fluid build-up that was never infected. In such cases, antibiotics will often not work as a treatment method. This form often lasts longer than acute otitis media; running its course after around four to six weeks.\nChronic otitis media: An acute middle ear infection with or without effusion that does not fully disappear or repeats frequently. This can lead to a prolonged inflammatory reaction with subsequent fluid build-up and often to a tear or perforation in the ear drum. When this happens, there will also be discharge from the middle ear. Chronic otitis media can lead to long-term hearing impairment.\n']","['A middle ear infection generally develops very rapidly.', 'Signs and symptoms in children may include:[2]', '\nEar pain\nGenerally feeling unwell (malaise)\nFever\nMuffled hearing/partial hearing loss\nFluid in the ear or yellow, clear or bloody discharge from the ears\nIncreased irritability, restlessness, crying and trouble feeding\nNausea, vomiting and/or dizziness\nA child may excessively pull, tug or touch their ears\n', 'Symptoms of a middle ear infection in adults may include:', '\nEar pain\nPartial hearing loss/muffled hearing\nFluid in the ear (that may leak out) or yellow, clear or bloody discharge from the ears\n', 'It is important to consult a doctor when:[3]', '\nSymptoms develop in a child of six months or younger\nA child displays symptoms for 48 hours or more and has a temperature of 39 C (102.2 F) or more\nSymptoms show no sign of improvement after two or three days\nSymptoms become worse rather than better over the first few days\nDischarge presents itself\nSymptoms are experienced by a person with an underlying health condition, such as cystic fibrosis or congenital heart disease, which could make complications more likely\n']","['Middle ear infections are caused by viruses and bacteria, often resulting from other conditions (flu, cold, allergy) that can cause blockage and swelling of the eustachian tubes that connect the throat and the middle ear. When this happens, a vacuum is created, allowing germs and fluid from the throat to enter the middle ear. A middle ear infection develops when bacteria or viruses grow in this fluid.[4]', 'Children are more susceptible to middle ear infections than adults, partly because their eustachian tubes are narrower, so they are more easily blocked. Children also have relatively larger adenoids than adults. These are masses of tissue situated at the point where the nose bends into the throat[5] that are vulnerable to infection, swelling and inflammation – when this happens, they can block the eustachian tubes and cause a middle ear infection.']","['In many cases, no treatment is required for a middle ear infection, with the symptoms fading quickly and the infection clearing up completely in anywhere between a number of days and two weeks. However, if the symptoms are severe or the infection is persistent, treatment methods are available.', 'Pain relief', 'Over-the-counter pain relief medication such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen (paracetamol) can be used by those experiencing a middle ear infection. When giving these drugs to children, a medical professional should be consulted first. Adults should read the instructions on the packaging closely before taking medicinal pain relief. For less severe pain, or if pharmaceuticals are not an option, a warm compress over the ear can also help relieve pain.[4]', 'Antibiotics', 'In children, antibiotics will normally be prescribed when:', '\nThe infection is severe\nThe child is younger than two years old, has an infection in both ears and has mild to severe pain and fever\nThe child is at risk of complications from the infection\n', 'In cases outside of these parameters, doctors will generally wait a few days before prescribing antibiotics. Adults will typically be prescribed antibiotics when the symptoms are severe or when the infection does not disappear naturally.', 'When taking antibiotics, it is extremely important to follow the exact instructions of the doctor or pharmacist and ensure the full course is taken. Failure to do so can result in a recurrence of the problem and in the development of antibiotic resistance in the bacteria causing the infection.', 'Ear tubes (grommets)', 'If an individual experiences persistent middle ear infections (generally defined as three episodes in six months or four in a year) then ear tubes – sometimes known as grommets – may be necessary.', 'To place these, a small hole is created in the eardrum. Through this, fluid is drained and a tube is fitted to ventilate the middle ear and prevent the further buildup of fluids. Some ear tubes will naturally fall out after a number of months, whereas others are designed to be worn for longer and may require a procedure in order to remove them. Both the initial insertion and the removal are relatively straightforward outpatient procedures.']"
['Migraine'],"['Migraines are severe, recurring headaches. This is a common condition which often affects younger adults (from teenagers through to middle-age), and tends to affect women more frequently than men. Migraines are usually accompanied by nausea and sensitivity to light (photophobia) and sound (phonophobia). Many, but not all, people experience aura before a migraine. While numerous triggers of attacks are known, the cause of migraine is not well understood. Migraines can managed by resting and taking medications for the headache. Although many people will experience recurring migraine, most people will be able to manage their symptoms.']","['The typical symptom of a migraine is a severe headache (often on one side of the head) with nausea, vomiting and sensitivity to light (photophobia) and sound (phonophobia).

Women are three times more likely to be affected by migraine headaches than men, because the development of headaches often relates to the hormonal changes that occur during the menstrual cycle.[3]', 'People affected by migraines usually experience headache attacks recurrently, on a lifelong basis after becoming initially affected. The frequency of attacks varies between people, occurring as often as several times per week in some people, and as rarely as once every few years in others.[4]', 'Migraines are primarily an episodic condition. This means that an affected person is at an increased likelihood of experiencing headache attacks during some time periods.', 'The likelihood of experiencing headaches relates to changeable factors and triggers, such as diet, stress levels, lifestyle, hormonal changes and a person’s overall health. If somebody is affected by migraine attacks on more than 15 days per month ‒ which is the case for eight percent of all people affected by migraines ‒  this is a rare subtype of the condition called chronic migraine.[5]', 'Appropriate methods for providing relief for migraine headaches can vary, depending on the type of migraine headaches a person experiences. Broadly speaking, treatment focuses on reducing the frequency of migraine attacks and alleviating the symptoms of the headache episodes. Currently, there is no cure for migraine headache disorder because the pathophysiology ‒ disordered physiological processes ‒ that result in a person developing migraine headaches are not yet fully understood.[6] However, with effective treatment and management, the potential negative impact of the condition on a person’s quality of life can usually be minimized effectively.']","['The principal symptoms of a classic migraine headache ‒ also called a migraine without aura  ‒ include:[6][7]', '\nA sensation of throbbing, pulsing pain: this usually builds up over one to two hours and intensifies with movement or physical activity\nPain which is localized to one side of the head, which may affect the eye area but can occur anywhere in the head or neck\nSensitivity to light\nSensitivity to sound\nVision changes, such as blurred vision\nNausea and food intolerance, which may in turn cause light-headedness\nVomiting\n', 'The duration of a migraine headache can be between 4 and 72 hours, if left untreated.', 'Other symptoms which may accompany a migraine headache attack may include:[4][6][7]', '\nMuscle tenderness, particularly in the cranial and cervical areas\nSensitivity to smell\nHypertension (high blood pressure) or hypotension (low blood pressure)\nTachycardia (elevated heart rate) or bradycardia (low heart rate)\nWeakness\nNumbness or tingling\nPuffy eyelids, conjunctival injection (red eyes) or adie-type pupil (dilated pupil which reacts slowly to changes in lighting)\nHorner syndrome: decreased pupil size, drooping eyelids and sweating on one side of the face\nFatigue\nAbdominal (tummy) pain\nDiarrhea or constipation\nSweating\nNeck pain\nFever, very rarely\n', 'Most, but not all people affected by migraine headaches, will experience some of these symptoms in addition to the headache pain.

Always consult a doctor before using any prescription or over-the-counter medication to ensure that it is suitable for use in pregnancy.', 'Diseases and infections', 'Diseases and infections commonly linked to miscarriage and pregnancy complications include chlamydia, Dengue fever, rubella, cytomegalovirus, malaria, brucellosis, influenza, vaginal infection with bacterial vaginosis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Seek medical attention at the first sign of infection when pregnant and avoid activities and environments associated with increased risk.[15]', 'Food poisoning', 'The most common types of food poisoning associated with miscarriage are salmonella, toxoplasmosis and listeriosis. Avoid uncooked and unpasteurised meats and animal products, in particular when pregnant in order to minimise the risk of food poisoning, and visit a doctor if symptoms such as fever, diarrhea or vomiting occur. Antibiotics given to pregnant people for food poisoning may reduce the likelihood of miscarrying if taken promptly.', 'Environmental factors', 'Smoking tobacco and working in workplaces such as radiology departments, factories or farms are associated with an increased risk of miscarriage. It is strongly recommended that all people, who are trying to conceive or are pregnant, adapt their lifestyle and day-to-day routine in order to avoid factors such as pollution, pesticides and radiation to minimize the risk of miscarriage.', 'Womb or cervical dysfunction', 'Problems with the womb or cervix structure or function can increase the likelihood of miscarrying.

This test can be:', '\nQualitative. A qualitative test is carried out to find out whether or not there is hCG in the blood, thereby proving the presence or absence of pregnancy. This is a urine test and is often how a person finds out they are pregnant initially.\nQuantitative. A quantitative test is carried out to find out the precise amount of hCG in the blood. This is a blood test which is performed by a doctor to discover more information about a particular pregnancy. It might be repeated over a period of days or weeks in order to ascertain whether a person’s hCG levels are rising, decreasing or stabilizing.\n', 'In a healthy pregnancy, hCG levels will continue to double approximately within the blood throughout the first trimester, reaching their peak at around week 11 of the pregnancy and decreasing slightly during the second trimester. If hCG levels begin to decrease in the first trimester, this is likely to indicate a miscarriage.', 'Wherever possible, this test will be performed in conjunction with ultrasound, fetal heart scanning and a pelvic exam before a miscarriage is diagnosed. However, in cases where ultrasound equipment is unavailable, the hCG blood test may sometimes be the primary means of confirming a suspected diagnosis of miscarriage.[16]', 'Pelvic exam', 'A pelvic exam to diagnose miscarriage will be performed by an obstetrician, i.e. a doctor specializing in childbirth, and/or a gynecologist, a doctor specialising in the female reproductive system.', 'During a pelvic exam, a person will wear a loose hospital gown and lie on their back, with their feet in stirrups, so that the vagina and cervix can be easily examined. When diagnosing miscarriage, a doctor will check for the presence of two principal signs indicating miscarriage:', '\nThe presence of tissue/blood in the cervical/vaginal opening\nThe dilation (opening) of the cervix\n', 'Ultrasound', 'Ultrasound is an imaging technique which uses soundwaves to create an image of the developing fetus in the body. It is a painless and non-invasive procedure which can be performed by using the scanner in two different ways:[17]', '\nTransvaginally, usually before week 11 of pregnancy. In this case, a scanning probe is inserted into the vagina.\nTransabdominally, usually from 11-12 weeks of pregnancy. Gel is spread on the skin of the lower abdomen, and the scanner is passed over the area.\n', 'In diagnosing a miscarriage, doctors will look for various indicators in the ultrasound images. These can suggest how far advanced the miscarriage is and what kind of miscarriage is taking place. Indicators of miscarriage may include:', 'An empty pregnancy sac in the uterus\nPregnancy tissue but no fetus in the uterus\nThe fetus or embryo is smaller than it should be by this stage of pregnancy\nNo fetal heartbeat, if the pregnancy is far enough advanced to detect it, usually after week seven of pregnancy', 'Fetal heart scanning', 'The absence of the fetal heart rate (the baby’s heartbeat) is a principal factor in diagnosing miscarriage.', 'The fetal heart scan is a specialized kind of ultrasound scan. The fetal heart can be scanned by means of ultrasound from around seven weeks into the pregnancy. At 13-14 weeks, the four chambers and great arteries can be clearly imaged, and many congenital heart abnormalities can be detected.[18]', 'As with a regular ultrasound scan, a fetal heart scan is a painless and non-invasive procedure, which can be performed transvaginally or transabdominally.[19]', 'Treatment for miscarriage @treatment:Treatment', 'If a miscarriage is causing abdominal pain, suitable painkillers will be prescribed or recommended, and one’s doctor will advise on an appropriate dose.

This is called a complete miscarriage.\nIn an incomplete miscarriage, some pregnancy tissue comes out of the uterus, but some remains inside. Treatment may be needed to remove the remaining tissue.\nIn a missed miscarriage, there are usually no cramps or bleeding, and the dead fetus remains inside the uterus. Sometimes, pregnancy tissue leaves the uterus, but a form of treatment may be needed to remove the fetus.\n', 'In a complete miscarriage, without significant blood loss, no further medical or surgical treatment is needed. A person will be given simple aftercare instructions, including A person will be advised not to have sexual intercourse or any kind of vaginal penetration until the bleeding associated with the miscarriage has stopped (usually within two weeks after the process begins). Normal menstrual periods usually return 4-6 weeks after a miscarriage.', 'In an incomplete or missed miscarriage, a surgical or medical procedure may be prescribed in some instances in order to clear the uterus of all fetal and pregnancy tissue. Where possible, the course of treatment is left to the discretion of the person who is having the miscarriage. The American Family Physician finds that better mental health outcomes after miscarriage can be expected when a person’s treatment preferences are respected.', 'An incomplete or missed miscarriage can be managed expectantly, medically or surgically.', 'Expectant management', 'Also known as conservative or wait-and-see management, expectant management involves waiting for the tissue to pass out of the womb naturally, which can take up to three weeks.

Medical or surgical intervention may be required if it does not complete as planned.[20]', 'Medical management', 'Medical management of miscarriage involves taking medication to cause the uterus to contract, so that the pregnancy tissue passes out of the womb. In most cases, the medication can be taken in the privacy of a person’s home. The medication used is called misoprostol. It can be taken in two forms:[21]', '\nOrally as a tablet\nVaginally as a pessary, i.e. a tablet which can be inserted into the vagina with a special applicator\n', 'Misoprostol works by causing cramping and bleeding to empty the uterus. Bleeding usually starts around one hour after taking the medication, and it takes 4-5 hours in total for the full amount of pregnancy tissue to pass. Nausea and diarrhea are common during this period, but are not a cause for concern.', 'Cramping may last for 1-2 days, and associated bleeding and spotting may continue for 4-5 weeks. A doctor will advise on the appropriate timing of the dose(s) and recommend suitable painkillers.[22]', 'If the miscarriage does not occur in the expected timeframe or there are any problems, it is important to consult a doctor. Surgery may be necessary to complete the process of miscarriage.', 'The recovery time after a medically-induced miscarriage is usually around four weeks, with a medical check-up usually scheduled for 1-2 weeks after taking the medication. Avoiding sexual activity until one’s next menstrual period is recommended to reduce the risk of infection.', 'Surgical management', 'Procedures which may be recommended following a miscarriage include:', '\nManual vacuum aspiration\nDilation and curettage (D&C)\nDilation and extraction (D&E)\n', 'Manual vacuum aspiration', 'This procedure is usually recommended for first-trimester miscarriages or as a means of removing leftover pregnancy tissue when the fetus has already passed out of the womb. A device is inserted into the cervix to empty the womb of all pregnancy tissue and fetal matter, using gentle suction. This procedure can be carried out under local anesthetic and takes around 10-15 minutes.', 'Medications to help the cervix dilate are usually given before the procedure. Light cramping and period-like pain can be expected afterwards. This usually settles within seven days.[23]', 'Manual vacuum aspiration is used much more frequently as a treatment option than dilation and curettage or dilation and extraction (below).', 'Dilation and curettage (D&C)', 'This procedure is usually recommended for people having first-trimester miscarriages. D&C is usually performed under general anesthetic, but can also be carried out using local anesthetic via an intravenous therapy (IV) drip. The vagina is dilated using a device called a speculum, and the contents of the uterus are removed using an instrument called a curette, which scrapes the pregnancy tissue and fetal matter out of the uterine wall. Medications to help the cervix dilate are usually given before the procedure.', 'A person can undergo D&C as an outpatient procedure in most cases and return to normal activity around 24 hours afterwards. Light cramping and bleeding may last for up to two weeks, and appropriate painkillers, usually ibuprofen, will be recommended.[24]', 'Dilation and extraction (D&E)', 'This procedure is usually recommended for people having second-trimester miscarriages. D&E is almost always performed under general anesthetic, but can be carried out using local anesthetic via an IV drip.', 'During the procedure, the vagina is dilated using a speculum, and forceps (a grasping instrument) is used to remove the foetus. Often, the fetus may need to be divided into parts before it can be removed. Medications to help the cervix dilate are usually given before the procedure.', 'After the fetus is removed, a curette is used to scrape any remaining pregnancy tissue from the uterine wall. A person can undergo D&E as an outpatient procedure in most cases and return to normal activity around 24 hours afterwards. Light cramping and bleeding may last for up to two weeks, and appropriate painkillers, usually ibuprofen, will be recommended.[25]', 'Post-miscarriage psychological intervention', 'Post-miscarriage intervention is psychological treatment following a miscarriage which focuses on helping one to overcome the feelings of grief, self-blame and worry that are commonly associated with miscarrying. It is very common to feel distressed following a miscarriage, and for some people these emotions can develop into depression and anxiety if left untreated.', 'The Miscarriage Association suggests that feelings associated with miscarrying might affect a person in a variety of different ways, including:', 'Guilt. Even though it is very unlikely that any given miscarriage could have been prevented, it is normal for a person to feel guilt after miscarrying, particularly if they were subject to any risk factors, such as a long-term health condition or a history of smoking, which may render miscarriage more likely.', 'Anger and jealousy. It is normal to feel anger in a variety of ways, including anger towards one’s own situation, oneself and hospital staff, and jealousy towards others who have never experienced a miscarriage or on hearing others’ pregnancy announcements.', 'Sadness. It is normal to feel sad and tearful, either in relation to specific thoughts or with no obvious trigger.', 'Shock and confusion. These emotions are especially common if the pregnancy was progressing healthily prior to the miscarriage.', 'Physical emptiness. It is common for a person to feel acutely aware that they are no longer carrying a developing fetus, particularly if they had been acutely monitoring their sensations during pregnancy.', 'Panic. A miscarriage can be an intensely stressful experience and a sensation of loss of control is common in the weeks following it.', 'Numbness. Although a miscarriage can be distressing for many people, it is also possible for a person to feel an absence of intense feelings and to find this distressing in itself.', 'Loneliness, Many people, who have experienced a miscarriage, report the sensation that others do not understand how they are feeling. There are many organizations which can connect a person with others who have shared the experience of miscarriage. This can be an effective way to alleviate the feelings of loneliness that often accompany this impactful life event.', 'There are many different formats of post-miscarriage intervention available for people affected by a miscarriage, which can help a person to process the experience and avoid developing long-term depression and anxiety. These include:', '\nOne-on-one counseling\nGroup counseling, for both partners and/or other family members\nMiscarriage support groups with other people who have experienced miscarriage\n', 'Healthcare providers will be able to direct people and families, who have experienced a miscarriage, towards available services and can provide advice on choosing the most appropriate kind of support for the affected person, couple or family.', 'Prevention', 'In most cases, it is not possible to prevent a miscarriage. However, it is possible to reduce the risk of miscarrying and to increase the potential of treating any complications of pregnancy that arise before they result in a miscarriage. This requires good antenatal care – a care plan devised with one’s doctor to increase the chances of a healthy pregnancy.', 'Antenatal care generally involves:', '\nHaving regular medical check-ups to ascertain the health of the pregnant person and developing fetus\nAvoiding alcohol, tobacco, excess caffeine and other substances associated with an increased risk of miscarrying\nAvoiding environments and situations which are associated with an increased risk of miscarrying\nEating a recommended pregnancy diet\nEnsuring that any pre-existing medical conditions which may affect pregnancy are adequately managed prior to conception to reduce their potential impact on the pregnancy\n', 'If you are considering becoming pregnanct and suspect you may have an undiagnosed medical condition due to the presence of unexplained symptoms, you can get a free symptom assessment by downloading the Ada app.', 'Miscarriage FAQs', 'Q: What are the most common misconceptions about the causes of miscarriage?\nA: There are several widespread myths about certain factors being causes of miscarriage. Many pregnant people avoid air travel, eating spicy food and having sexual relations during pregnancy, but these activities are not medically linked to miscarrying. It is also common to avoid exercise during pregnancy with the aim of preventing a miscarriage. However, as long as an exercise programme has been approved by a doctor, it is safe for a pregnant person to carry out without risk to the developing fetus.[10]', 'Read more about the Causes of Miscarriage »', 'Q: If a pregnant person experiences cramping, vaginal bleeding or discharge, does this mean they are having a miscarriage?\nA: Not necessarily. Vaginal bleeding is common in early pregnancy. Bleeding may occur due to the implantation of the fertilized egg in the uterus (implantation bleeding), and discharge can be caused by more blood than normal flowing to the pelvic area during pregnancy. However, bleeding and cramping may indicate a miscarriage, and a pregnant person should always consult their doctor if they experience vaginal bleeding in order to confirm the status of the developing fetus.', 'Read more about the Signs of Miscarriage »', 'Q: How soon after a miscarriage can a person have sex and/or try to become pregnant again?\nA: For most people, the vaginal bleeding associated with a miscarriage lasts for under two weeks. During the period of vaginal bleeding, the uterus and cervix may remain dilated. This renders the vaginal area at increased risk of contracting bacterial infections. The risk of infection can be reduced by avoiding sexual activity involving the vagina until the bleeding has stopped.', 'Waiting until after the next period before trying to conceive is recommended after a miscarriage. It is possible to become pregnant as soon as a new egg is released and fertilized by a sperm, which may happen as soon as a new reproductive cycle begins in the female body. Although it is therefore possible to become pregnant very soon after a miscarriage, waiting until the next period is recommended for two principal reasons: it increases one’s chances of accurately dating the new pregnancy, and it allows for the womb and cervix to return to their normal function following the miscarriage, helping to ensure hospitable conditions for the new developing fetus.', 'Q: Is a person who has had a miscarriage more likely than others to miscarry in future?\nA: Having a miscarriage is not an indication that a person will miscarry in the future. Many people experience one or more miscarriages before going on to have a healthy pregnancy. If a person experiences more than one miscarriage, they may wish to undergo tests to identify any underlying conditions which may be causing them to miscarry. However, it is possible to experience recurrent miscarriages without discerning an underlying cause and to then go on to have a healthy pregnancy.', 'Other names for miscarriage', '\nspontaneous abortion\n', '', ""\n\n“Facts about stillbirth.” Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 02 October 2017.

['Molar Pregnancy'],"['A molar pregnancy, sometimes called a hydatidiform mole or gestational trophoblastic disease, is a rare complication of pregnancy, which results from a problem related to the genetic makeup of the fused egg and sperm and which occurs during conception. This causes a fluid-filled mass of tissue to grow inside the womb, instead of a healthy pregnancy. A molar pregnancy will not develop into a baby.', 'A molar pregnancy will often have the same symptoms as a normal pregnancy in its early stages, and may go undetected until the first routine ultrasound scan, if it is not miscarried before this time.  Most molar pregnancies are diagnosed in the first trimester, before any classic signs and symptoms are present. However, symptoms which could indicate a molar pregnancy include vaginal bleeding, severe nausea and vomiting, tummy growth which can be faster or slower than normal, and signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism.[1][2]', 'A molar pregnancy can be removed, and most people will make a full recovery. Very rarely, molar pregnancy may become cancerous. However, these cancers have a very good prognosis with a high cure rate of nearly 100 percent.[3]', 'Molar pregnancy affects about one in every 1000 or 2000 pregnant people.[4] The reported incidence varies widely in different regions of the world.', 'Many people experience emotional distress after having a molar pregnancy, particularly if it occurs during a planned pregnancy or if chemotherapy is necessary. A range of therapeutic treatment options are available.']","['Molar pregnancy often has no symptoms differing from a normal pregnancy and is frequently diagnosed during a routine ultrasound. However, the most common signs and symptoms that could indicate molar pregnancy are:[5][6]', '\nVaginal bleeding early in the pregnancy, which may contain little fluid-filled cysts\nHigh level of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) (pregnancy hormone)\nBigger abdomen (tummy) than expected for the number of weeks pregnant\nPelvic pressure or pain\n', 'Less common signs and symptoms include:[5]', '\nHyperemesis gravidarum (severe nausea and vomiting)\nEarly onset preeclampsia (high blood pressure in pregnancy)\nSigns of hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid), such as nervousness, insomnia and heart palpitations\n']","['A molar pregnancy occurs when there is a problem with the genetic information of a fused ovum (egg) and sperm. While a molar pregnancy cannot be predicted, because little is known about how and why it occurs, factors that are thought to increase the risk of having one include:[6][7]', '\nBeing younger than 15 or older than 35\nA history of molar pregnancy\nA history of miscarriage\nA diet low in carotene (a form of vitamin A)\n', 'Types of molar pregnancy', 'A molar pregnancy may be complete or incomplete, depending on the number of chromosomes of the fertilized egg.', 'In normal conception, a single sperm with 23 chromosomes fertilizes an egg with 23 chromosomes, making 46 in all.', 'Complete molar pregnancy', 'In this situation, one sperm, or sometimes two, fertilize an egg that has no genetic material.  No embryo will grow, because there are no maternal chromosomes.', 'Normally a fertilized empty egg dies, but in rare cases it implants in the uterine wall. This causes trophoblast cells, the cells that would become a placenta, to grow rapidly into clusters of cysts or a complete mole.[8][9]', 'Partial molar pregnancy', 'A partial mole occurs when two sperm fertilize the egg instead of one. This means that there are 69 instead of 46 chromosomes, creating too much genetic material.', 'There may initially be a fetus, but it will be genetically abnormal and cannot survive, while the trophoblastic cells will grow rapidly, filling the womb with cysts.[8][9]']","['Treatment for a molar pregnancy usually takes the form of dilation and curettage (D&C), sometimes known as surgical uterine evacuation, dilation and evacuation, surgical management of miscarriage (SMM), evacuation of retained products of conception (ERPC) or a scrape. This is a minor operation done under general anesthetic, in which the cervix, the passage leading from the uterus to the vagina, is dilated so that abnormal tissue in the uterus can be removed with suction and a spoon-like instrument (curette). There is likely to be vaginal bleeding for up to six weeks after surgery, which may be heavy at first.', 'People who have completed childbearing may have the option of hysterectomy, a surgical procedure to remove the womb.', 'Molar pregnancy follow-up', 'There is a small risk of developing gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) after a molar pregnancy has been treated. GTN is a serious condition that requires rapid treatment, so all people who have had molar pregnancies should be monitored afterwards.', 'During a molar pregnancy, hCG (pregnancy hormone) levels rise, but should return to normal once the person has been treated. For at least six months after the end of treatment for a molar pregnancy, hCG levels will typically be monitored through urine tests. If they do not return to normal, this could indicate GTN.', 'It is important to take steps to avoid becoming pregnant for about six months after treatment, as this would interfere with the monitoring of hCG levels for signs of GTN.', 'After a complete mole, the likelihood of developing GTN is significantly increased. After a partial mole, this risk only increases slightly.

These emotions are especially common if the pregnancy was planned and thought to be healthy prior to an ultrasound scan or miscarriage. It can be shocking for a person to find out they have a condition which they probably never heard of before.\nFear and anxiety. A molar pregnancy may lead to fear of the possibility of having cancer, and fear that problems will happen again with any future pregnancies.\nLoss and grief. It is normal to feel grief if a baby was expected.\nFeeling stuck. It is common to feel stuck if wanting to try to conceive again and having to wait some time while having follow-up and repeated blood and urine tests.\n', 'Counseling is available for people affected by a molar pregnancy. Support groups such as MyMolarPregnancy.com are also available and may be able to put a person in touch with others in a similar situation.', 'Health practitioners will be able to provide advice to those affected by a molar pregnancy on choosing the most appropriate kind of support and direct them towards available services.', 'Molar pregnancy FAQs', 'Q: Can a molar pregnancy survive?\nA: No, a molar pregnancy cannot develop into a baby, as it does not have a correct set of chromosomes. Molar pregnancies may at first seem to have the same symptoms as a normal pregnancy and generate a positive result on a pregnancy test. In the case of complete molar pregnancy, no fetus will develop. In a partial molar pregnancy, fetal tissue may initially develop, it will, however, be genetically abnormal and cannot survive, and will be overtaken by rapidly-growing cysts.', 'Q: Will a person who has had a molar pregnancy be able to have a normal pregnancy in future?\nA: Yes, a person who has had a molar pregnancy will normally have no complications with future pregnancies. The risk of another molar pregnancy is increased, but is still only around 1-2 percent. The recurrence rate after two molar pregnancies has been reported to range from 11 to 25 percent. However, a person should take measures to avoid becoming pregnant for at least six months after the end of molar pregnancy treatment, to allow hCG monitoring for remaining molar tissue. If chemotherapy follow-up treatment has been used, a person should take measures to avoid becoming pregnant for at least one year after the end of treatment, to allow for hCG monitoring and also to allow the chemotherapy, which can be very damaging to an unborn baby, to clear the body.', 'Q: Blighted ovum vs molar pregnancy - what is the difference?\nA: Blighted ovum, also known as anembryonic pregnancy, is a condition in which a fertilized egg attaches itself to the uterine wall, but an embryo does not develop, usually due to chromosomal abnormalities or abnormal cell division. Molar pregnancy is caused by chromosomal abnormalities due to abnormal conception, and causes a mass of fluid-filled cysts to grow, instead of a healthy pregnancy. Blighted ovum and partial molar pregnancy can look similar on an ultrasound. However, a partial mole usually shows the remains of embryonic tissue, which never appears in a blighted ovum.[12]', 'Other names for molar pregnancy', '\nHydatidiform mole\nComplete mole\nPartial mole\n', '', '\n\nMedscape eMedicine ""Hydatidiform Mole Clinical Presentation."" 16 February 2018.

['Morning Sickness'],"['Morning sickness is pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting, typically occurring between weeks 5 and 20. Despite the name, the symptoms of morning sickness can present themselves at any time of the day, and some women may feel sick throughout the day.', 'The condition affects roughly 50 to 90 percent of pregnant women. It is generally mild and usually poses no risk to the developing baby, unless it develops into a more severe and longer lasting condition called hyperemesis gravidarum, which may affect the baby’s birth weight.[1] However, morning sickness can cause discomfort and significantly interfere with the day-to-day lives of pregnant women. There are a range of treatment options available to help manage the condition.']","['The key symptoms of morning sickness are nausea and vomiting. Symptoms typically come and go throughout the day and last for between one and four hours. Some women, however, may feel sick throughout the day.', 'The symptoms of morning sickness usually begin during weeks 5 to 6, peak during week 9 of pregnancy and disappear by week 16 to 20. Morning sickness can, however, in rare cases, last for the entire duration of a pregnancy. If you or a loved one is experiencing symptoms that may be linked to morning sickness, download the free Ada app for a symptom assessment.', 'When to see a doctor: hyperemesis gravidarum', 'Although it can cause significant discomfort and interfere with everyday life, morning sickness is a typically mild condition. If the condition is severe, this could be a sign of hyperemesis gravidarum – a more serious form of morning sickness.', 'Hyperemesis gravidarum can lead to serious complications for mother and baby, including dehydration and a low birth weight. If any of the following symptoms are experienced, a doctor should be contacted as a matter of urgency.', 'Signs and symptoms of hyperemesis gravidarum include:[1][4]', '\nSevere and prolonged nausea and vomiting\nAn inability to keep fluids down\nSigns of dehydration such as infrequent urination because of not producing much urine, dark urine and dizziness due to low blood pressure\nAbdominal pain or cramping\nWeight loss of more than five pounds (2.3 kg)\nFever and diarrhea\n', 'If treated effectively, hyperemesis gravidarum is unlikely to cause any harm to the baby.']","['The specific cause of morning sickness is not clear, though it is likely to be due to the hormonal changes the body undergoes during pregnancy.', 'There are, nonetheless, certain things that can make morning sickness more likely. These include:[2][3]', '\nIt being a first pregnancy\nHaving a female baby\nHaving twins or multiple babies\nHaving a history of motion sickness\nHaving a history of migraines\nHaving had nausea when taking the combined contraceptive pill\nFamily history of morning sickness\nStress\nObesity\nHaving gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)\n']","['Treatment for morning sickness is aimed at providing as much relief from the symptoms of the condition as possible and avoiding any loss of weight or deficiency of any vitamins or minerals. There is no specific treatment method that works for all women. Instead, women are encouraged to try a variety of methods to see what works for them.', 'To help manage mild cases of morning sickness, simple lifestyle changes may be recommended. These include:[5]', '\nGetting plenty of rest\nAvoiding smells, foods or anything else that may trigger nausea, which could include stuffy and/or noisy rooms, heat and humidity\nEating small and frequent meals, perhaps every one to two hours and high in carbohydrates and low in fat\nDrinking plenty of fluids\nEating food or drink containing ginger, which, evidence suggests, is a natural antiemetic (vomiting suppressant)\n', 'If lifestyle changes do not help to remedy the morning sickness, a doctor may prescribe pregnancy-friendly anti-sickness medication (antiemetics). Often, this will be a form of vitamin B6 called pyridoxine, which may be used in combination with a specific antihistamine – doxylamine – which is usually used to treat allergies, but which can also be effective at preventing sickness. The medication will generally be in tablet form, though an injection or suppository may be used if the individual is unable to keep down fluids.[5]', 'The medications used to treat morning sickness are safe for use in pregnancy and will have no effect on the development of the baby. However, before taking any type of medication, always seek the opinion of a doctor.', 'In a small number of cases, those that resemble hyperemesis gravidarum, morning sickness may need to be treated in a hospital. This will only be necessary if the individual does not respond to treatment and is consequently losing weight and becoming dehydrated. In the hospital, fluids will be administered intravenously (through a drip) to prevent dehydration.', 'Alternative morning sickness treatment methods', 'There are a number of alternative treatment methods for morning sickness.', 'Acupuncture and acupressure  have become particularly popular. The first is a technique derived from ancient Chinese medicine involving the insertion of fine needles into certain points on the body; the latter is a technique similar to acupuncture, involving the application of pressure to certain points on the body, often using a specially designed wristband.', 'Both techniques can be self-administered and do not require a prescription, making them easily accessible to most women. Although neither technique is medically proven beyond doubt to be effective besides the possibility of a placebo effect, both are considered to be safe during pregnancy and may help on an individual basis.[6]', 'Hypnosis is also considered safe and may be helpful in the relief of symptoms for some patients. Psychotherapy, likewise, can also be useful and supportive for some women, especially those whose symptoms are exacerbated by anxiety and stress surrounding the pregnancy.[6]', 'Most other alternative treatment methods have not been studied comprehensively and should therefore be avoided. This includes marijuana, which is not considered safe for consumption during pregnancy by most medical professionals.[6]']"
['Multiple Myeloma'],"['Multiple myeloma is a cancer which affects the bone marrow. The bone marrow is where blood cells are made and mature. Myeloma is caused by a white blood cell called a plasma cell, which normally work to produce proteins which fight infections (antibodies). When a plasma cell cancer occurs, the plasma cells not only grow out of control in the bone marrow, but also impair the ability of the bone marrow to make other healthy blood cells. Multiple myeloma is so named because the cancer is often found in several different bones. Symptoms of multiple myeloma may be the result of decreased normal blood cells, such as paleness, shortness of breath, feeling more tired than usual and bleeding gums, or the result of quick growth of the cancer cells, such as unexpected weight loss, bone pain or fragile bones. There is currently no cure for multiple myeloma, but there are treatment options that help to control the disease. Myeloma is usually a slow-growing cancer, and for this reason, the outlook depends on factors such the age of the person diagnosed, the aggressiveness of the cancer and the development of complications.']","['Common symptoms include paleness, shortness of breath, feeling tired and bleeding gums. Other symptoms may include weight loss, bone pain and fragile bones. Some people may suffer blood clots, recurrent infections or kidney problems. There may be no symptoms in the early stages of this condition, because symptoms develop as the disease progresses.']",,"['There is currently no cure for multiple myeloma, but there are treatment options that help to control the disease. Treatment may involve a combination of chemotherapy, radiotherapy and stem cell transplantation. The exact combination of therapies depends on the stage of the disease, the general health of the affected person and whether any complications have occurred. The treating doctor can give the best advice for treatment in individual cases. Complications such as bone pain, fracture, anemia and kidney damage may require specific treatment.']"
['Multiple Sclerosis'],"['Multiple sclerosis (commonly called MS) is a neurological disease, in which there is slow, progressive nerve damage. The cause of this nerve damage is unknown, but may be related to an overactive immune system. This condition is more common in women than men, and most people are diagnosed between the ages of 15 and 60. Because all of the nerves in the body can be affected, the symptoms of MS also vary from person to person. The most common symptoms are vision problems, strange sensations in the arms and legs and muscle weakness. MS is diagnosed by a specialist neurologist and by having magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The symptoms of MS can be relapsing (symptoms come and go, with symptom-free periods), or can progressively worsen without improvement. There are treatments which can help with the symptoms and slow down the progression of the nerve damage, but no treatments which can cure MS.']","['MS can affect any nerves in the body, so the symptoms can be very different from person to person. More common symptoms include a loss of vision, a loss of feeling in the arms or legs, weakness in the arms or legs, dizziness and imbalance. Some people develop bowel and bladder problems. Additionally, a lot of people with MS find that they feel tired all the time. People with MS may experience cycles of relapse (in which their symptoms come and go, with symptom-free periods), or can progressively worsen without improvement. Warm weather or warm baths may make symptoms worse.']",,"['Treatment mostly consists of weakening the immune system. There are many medications that can do this for people with MS. One of the most widely used medications is called interferon. These medications can help to reduce the severity of the episodes and prolong the period between attacks. However, there is currently no cure available for MS. Physical exercise and physiotherapy can be helpful to maintain strength and balance, and regain strength after an episode.']"
['Mumps'],"['Mumps is a contagious viral infection. The mumps virus is spread via saliva droplets which are released into the air when coughing or sneezing or by sharing cups or cutlery. The most common symptom is a swelling of the face under the ears, along with a fever, sore throat and tiredness. The condition usually gets better without causing serious complications. Treatment is limited to painkillers, cool compresses on the swollen face and plenty of rest and fluids. Vaccination against mumps is a very effective form of prevention. Most people who have mumps will get better within around a week.']","['Symptoms appear within three weeks after catching the virus. The most common symptom is a swelling of the cheeks and jaw. The swelling can occur on one or on both sides of the face. Other symptoms include a fever, headaches, a sore throat, feeling sick and tiredness. Although complications are rare, mumps can cause meningitis (swelling of the tissues around the brain), painful swelling of the testicles, abdominal pain or hearing loss.']",,"['There is no specific treatment for mumps. Most treatment aims to relieve symptoms. People with mumps should rest and drinking plenty of fluids. Cool flannels or packs on the face may help to reduce the swelling. Pain and fever can be eased by taking paracetamol or ibuprofen. As chewing can be painful, soft food or soups may be helpful.']"
['Musculoskeletal Lower Back Pain'],"['Musculoskeletal lower back pain is a common condition affecting the muscles and bones of the lower back. About 40 percent of the population will have this condition at some point of their life. It can develop suddenly or progressively over many weeks or months. Accidents, fractures, surgery, heavy work, intensive sports and medical conditions (such as arthritis and osteoarthritis) are common causes of the lower back pain. Back pain, back stiffness and back muscle spasms are typical symptoms. Treatment depends upon the cause of the pain.']","['The most typical symptom is pain over the lower back and, sometimes, the buttocks. The pain can be sharp, dull, aching or with tingling or burning sensations. Pain can differ from person to person and also may involve radiating pain to the hip or even further down. Certain movements may make the pain better or worse. The muscles of the back may become stiff or hard.']",,"['The treatment of lower back pain involves pain relief and gentle movements of the back. Simple pain-relief, such as paracetamol and ibuprofen are often helpful in reducing back pain. People with back pain should continue their daily activities and gentle exercise, such as walking, as soon as possible. Resting the back for a long period may make symptoms worse and make the person susceptible to recurrent back pain.']"
['Myasthenia Gravis'],"[""Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune condition that causes muscles to become weak and quickly tired. In this condition the immune system mistakenly produces proteins that fight infections (antibodies) that attack the the body's healthy tissues. These interfere with the ability of nerves to pass information to muscles. Often the muscles of the eyes and eyelids are affected, causing the common symptoms of eyelid drooping and blurred vision. Muscle weakness typically becomes more noticeable over the course of the day or with exertion and improves on resting. Medication is available that improves the communication between nerves and muscles and thus increases the muscles strength, but there is no sure cure for this condition.""]","['The main symptom of myasthenia gravis is a muscle weakness which gets worse over the course of the day. The most commonly affected muscles are the eye, face and throat. People with myasthenia gravis may notice that their eyelids droop, that they develop blurred or double vision or difficulties with chewing, talking or swallowing. Sometimes the muscles of the limbs or the neck can be affected. This may cause problems with walking, posture and balance. People with myasthenia gravis may experience a period during which their symptoms become much worse than normal. These episodes can cause weakness of the breathing muscles and lead to severe breathing difficulty with an inability to cough.']",,"['Muscle weakness can be improved by taking medication that improves the communication between nerves and muscles. Medications to dampen the immune system, such as steroids and immuno-suppressant medications, are also commonly used. In cases of a severe deterioration of muscle strength, medications may need to be given through the veins to suppress the immune system. In some cases, removal of the thymus gland can improve the symptoms, but this does not cause immediate improvement.']"
['Myocardial Infarction'],"['Myocardial infarction, commonly known as a heart attack, is a serious condition where a coronary artery (a blood vessel of the heart) is blocked and can not supply the heart muscle with blood and oxygen. This causes damage to the heart muscle. The typical symptoms are chest and arm pain, shortness of breath, nausea and a cold sweat. A heart attack requires immediate medical assistance.']","['The most common symptom is the feeling of pressure, tightness or pain in the chest, which may spread to the left arm or the jaw or the back. Not all people who are having a heart attack have chest pain. Other common symptoms are shortness of breath, cold sweats, dizziness, fainting and nausea.']",,"['Treatment during a heart attack aims to widen the blocked blood vessel, remove the blockage in the heart artery and help the person having the heart attack with pain relief, extra oxygen etc. To widen the artery, the paramedics or doctors will give a tablet or spray immediately, called nitroglycerine. To remove the blockage, the person having the heart attack will have medications to thin the blood. Sometimes urgent cardiac catheterization (a tube through the leg blood vessels into the heart blood vessels) is done to find and remove the blockage. If the blockage or narrowing is severe, the doctor may put a stent (a small wire cage) into the blood vessel to widen the vessel. It is important to have urgent treatment in order to prevent heart muscle damage. After a heart attack, cardiac rehabilitation (physical therapy) is important to help the heart regain strength.']"
['Myocarditis'],"['The definition of myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle, the myocardium.

['Nappy Rash'],"['Diaper rash is a type of skin inflammation which appears as a bright red rash on the skin covered by a diaper on the baby’s bottom. It occurs typically in infants and children below the age of 2 years old. In addition, It can also be observed in adults who are obliged to wear a diaper due to various reasons. Most babies will get a diaper rash at least once during the first 2 years of life, and it is often related to infrequently changed or wet diapers, sensitive skin, and skin chafing. Diaper rash could be alarming for the parents and annoying for the babies. However it usually clears up with simple home treatments, such as more frequent diaper changes, air drying and the usage of ointments.']","['Diaper rash is usually relatively easy to identify.

['Neonatal Jaundice'],"['Neonatal jaundice – otherwise known as neonatal hyperbilirubinemia – is a common and usually harmless condition that turns the skin and other parts of a newborn baby’s body yellow in color.[1] Jaundice is often found among newborn babies. In fact, it is the most common disorder for which newborns receive medical attention and/or are (re)admitted to hospital. The condition is caused by excessive levels of the chemical compound bilirubin in the tissues of the body.', 'Although neonatal jaundice is normally a non-serious condition, babies experiencing the disorder should always be seen by a doctor or midwife, who will be able to advise on a method of treatment where necessary. In very rare cases, when the levels of bilirubin are very high, serious complications are possible.[1]']","['The main symptom of neonatal jaundice is a yellowing of the skin and other parts of the body. As the condition progresses, the whites of the eyes may take on a yellow tinge.', 'Symptoms will typically begin in the region of the face and gradually progress down the body to the legs. This progression may be unidentifiable in some cases, with the discoloration appearing to occur across the whole body all at once. If there is any doubt about skin discoloration, possible in babies with dark skin, this can be checked by pressing a finger down on the skin. In cases of jaundice, the skin should appear yellow  when the finger is released.[2]', 'Signs that neonatal jaundice is worsening include:', '\nYellow skin below the knee\nYellow skin becoming more intense in colour\nDifficulty feeding the baby\nDifficulty waking the baby\nIrritability\nThe baby arching his/her neck or body backwards\n', 'If any of these signs occur, immediate medical attention should be sought. If you are concerned that a child you are for has neonatal jaundice, you can do a free symptom assessment with the Ada app at any time.']","['Neonatal jaundice is caused by a buildup of the chemical compound bilirubin in the blood. Normally, the liver breaks down bilirubin and disposes of it through urine and stool. If bilirubin is produced faster than it can be broken down, jaundice occurs.', 'Newborns process bilirubin more slowly than adults, because their liver and intestines are not yet completely mature. The breakdown of red blood cells in infants can be related to:[2][3]', '\nBruising or mild injury to the newborn during delivery.\nAn incompatibility between the mother’s blood type and that of the baby, which may cause the mother’s immune system to attack the baby’s red blood cells.\nHereditary causes of red blood cell breakdown, such as a deficiency of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PD). This is more common among people of an African-American, Asian or Mediterranean ancestry.\nAsian ancestry. In Asians, the ability to remove bilirubin takes longer to develop.\n', 'A slight increase in the breakdown of red blood cells, combined with a liver that is not functioning very well, can therefore lead to jaundice.[3] Generally, bilirubin production slows down significantly a few weeks after birth, once the liver and intestines are fully developed.[2][3]', 'Physiological jaundice', 'Physiological jaundice is the most common form of the condition and is largely harmless. It usually begins two days after birth, reaches its peak at four days and disappears after seven to ten days. This type of neonatal jaundice is caused by a mild accumulation of bilirubin.', 'Prolonged jaundice', 'Jaundice in infants is classified as prolonged jaundice if symptoms persist for 14 days or longer after birth; this can be 21 days in premature babies.[4] The condition is usually caused by breastfeeding (see FAQs below), but may indicate a more serious problem. A doctor will be able to identify the cause behind prolonged jaundice and recommend treatment.', 'Other types of neonatal jaundice', 'Neonatal jaundice will usually disappear after the liver has had time to fully develop and red blood cell breakdown has naturally slowed. If this does not happen, it may be that the condition is being caused by other factors. Additional signs that this is the case may include:', '\nThe baby is unwell, e.g. not feeding well or unusually  irritable or appears a lot quieter than usual\nSymptoms of jaundice are present in the first 24 hours after birth\nSymptoms of jaundice are still present two weeks after birth\nThe baby has pale, chalky stools\nThe baby has urine that causes dark stains on the nappy\n', 'These symptoms may indicate that the baby has more severe hyperbilirubinemia, and in these cases it will be especially important to seek medical attention without delay.', 'Factors that may cause a more serious form of neonatal jaundice include blood or liver conditions, as well as blood type incompatibility with the mother. When a baby and mother have incompatible blood types, the mother’s blood can destroy red blood cells in the baby and cause jaundice.']","['Treatment for neonatal jaundice is aimed at reducing the levels of bilirubin in the blood. In mild cases, no treatment at all may be required other than monitoring the child, making sure that the jaundice improves.', 'In other cases, treatment may be necessary and  options include:', 'Phototherapy', 'Phototherapy is the most common treatment option for babies with jaundice and is in the majority of cases the only treatment method that is necessary for recovery.', 'Phototherapy involves exposing the baby’s skin to special blue light, which is able to break down bilirubin into a harmless substance. For the best results, the baby should be exposed to the light for as long as possible. This will usually take place at the hospital, but in some cases may be possible to do it at home.', 'Generally, phototherapy is very safe, though the infant’s eyes will need to be protected from the light, and temporary side-effects such as dehydration, a skin rash and loose stool may result. These are all treatable.', 'Intravenous immunoglobulins', 'Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment is used for the treatment of blood group, Rhesus (Rh), ABO and other blood group incompatibilities. It is believed to reduce the need for exchange transfusions.', 'Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy may not be very helpful for babies that are already immunized, but it has been shown to be beneficial to babies that would otherwise need an exchange transfusion. The reasons behind this are not completely understood. In some cases, it may be necessary to try IVIG preparations from various manufacturers if the initial treatment does not work.', 'Generally, IVIG preparations are infused intravenously over a period of a few hours. The process can be repeated, and combined with phototherapy.', 'Exchange transfusion', 'In emergency situations, when very high levels of bilirubin need to be reduced quickly, an exchange transfusion may be required. This is a procedure in which some of the baby’s blood is replaced with donor blood. This can be effective in bringing down bilirubin levels quickly.']"
['Nephritic Syndrome'],"['Nephritic syndrome is the name given to a collection of different signs and symptoms that occur as a result of inflammation in the kidneys.

People with nephritic syndrome also often develop high blood pressure.', 'Treatment depends on the underlying cause, but usually involves managing the high blood pressure and reducing the inflammation in the kidneys. Although many people recover well from nephritic syndrome, some people may go on to develop renal failure. The risk of renal failure depends on the severity of the syndrome and its underlying cause.', 'Nephritic syndrome is not a disease but a syndrome. A syndrome is a group of symptoms that often and predictably occur together, and which develop as a result of another condition. Syndromes are not necessarily specific to any disease or disorder. Nephritic syndrome has many potential triggers, therefore, successfully treating it involves identifying the underlying cause.[1]', 'Nephritic syndrome has both acute and chronic forms. Acute, or rapidly-progressing, nephritic syndrome usually comes on suddenly and, because of acute and painful symptoms, seldom goes undetected. Chronic nephritic syndrome typically progresses slowly and often goes undetected for some time.

Nephritic syndrome following a streptococcal throat infection is fairly common, especially in children.', 'Viral infections: Such as hepatitis B, mumps, measles, chicken pox or glandular fever (mononucleosis).', 'Multisystem systemic/inflammatory diseases: Such as vasculitis, Goodpasture’s Syndrome, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Henoch-Schönlein purpura, or lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus).', 'Abdominal abscess: A pocket of infected fluid and pus inside the abdominal cavity. This can be located on or near any organ.', 'Parasitic infections: Such as malaria.', 'As there are many underlying conditions for nephritic syndrome, there are different risk factors, such as recent infections, immune system disorders and genetic disorders. See the sections below for more information on the relationship between nephritic syndrome and glomerulonephritis, and nephritic syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus.']","['Treatment depends on the underlying causes. Medications (such as ramipril, benazepril, candesartan, or valsartan) are typically used to treat the high blood pressure. Medications will also be administered to reduce inflammation in the kidneys.', 'Generally, doctors will recommend:[1]', '\nBed rest\nA diet that is restricted in salt, potassium and fluid\nMedication to control blood pressure, if necessary\nMedication to reduce inflammation\nMedication to remove fluids from the body\nDialysis to replace kidney function in severe cases\n', 'The time it takes to recover from nephritic syndrome varies according to its severity and the underlying cause.  Most patients begin to feel better fairly soon, especially if treatment is prompt.', 'Nephritic syndrome and other kidney disorders', 'Kidney disorders are complex and may not be entirely distinguishable from one another without extensive testing.

Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by severe proteinuria, i.e. high amounts of protein, including albumin, in the urine, while nephritic syndrome’s major feature is inflammation. Depending on the specific underlying conditions of the two, nephrotic syndrome often is the more serious.[9] In both cases, medical care should be sought as a matter of urgency. Doctors will usually need to order tests to determine whether a patient has nephritic or nephrotic syndrome.[9][8][10]', 'Nephritic syndrome and acute glomerulonephritis', 'Glomerulonephritis refers to a number of kidney problems that involve inflammation in the glomeruli, which are the kidney’s filtration units. Acute glomerulonephritis can cause nephritic syndrome. Glomerulonephritis can be acute (sudden onset, lasting for a short time) or chronic (long-lasting), and it can result from a variety of factors, such as:[11]', '\nInfections, especially those involving streptococcal bacteria\nAutoimmune conditions, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (see below)\nHereditary factors\n', 'Edema, hematuria and hypertension are known as the nephritic triad.', 'Acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN) generally, and rapidly-progressive glomerulonephritis (RPG) occasionally result from infections.[12][13]', 'The symptoms of acute glomerulonephritis resemble those of acute nephritic syndrome, and include:[14][15]', '\nEdema, often showing first as facial puffiness in the morning\nHematuria: blood in the urine, which can color it pink, red or brown\nOliguria: producing less urine than usual\nHypertension: high blood pressure\nFatigue: feeling tired, weak and/or exhausted (almost) constantly\n', 'Edema can also cause shortness of breath and coughing.', 'Post-infectious glomerulonephritis and acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis', 'Post-infectious glomerulonephritis is a common cause of acute glomerulonephritis, especially among children. It can be caused by a wide range of conditions and factors, including viral infections such as Epstein-Barr virus infection, the flu or Hepatitis B, and bacterial infections such as staphylococcal, pneumococcal and streptococcal infections. It commonly occurs after streptococcal infections.[16]', 'Some conditions that can increase a person’s risk of developing post-infectious glomerulonephritis are for example:[12][16]', '\nSore throat, usually pharyngitis\nSkin infections\nDiabetes\nAlcoholism\nMalignancies such as cancer or leukemia\nHeart-valve replacement surgery\nHIV infection\nIntravenous drug use\n', 'In acute postinfectious glomerulonephritis, the symptoms typically appear some weeks after the infection that triggered it has cleared up. This is typically within one to two weeks after pharyngitis or up to a month after a skin infection. If symptoms appear within a few days, however, it is possible that there are existing renal problems.[12]', 'Symptoms of acute postinfectious glomerulonephritis include the nephritic triad:[13][14][15]', '\nHematuria, causing red, pink, brown or cola-colored urine\nEdema, causing facial puffiness and swelling in the legs and arms\nHypertension, or high blood pressure\n', 'Oliguria, or reduced urine output, is less common, occurring in less than half of cases. Urinalysis can confirm hematuria even if no blood is visible in the urine; in this case it is called microscopic hematuria.', 'Acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN) usually follows an infection, typically a streptococcal infection of the throat or skin, but also may result from mild infections that follow other illnesses or surgical procedures. APSGN is a post-infectious glomerulonephritis.', 'Acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is most commonly found among children between the ages of four and 12, although it is also becoming more common among people who are older than 50.[15] It is more common among men than women.', 'The prognosis for children with acute postinfectious glomerulonephritis is good, though it can be less positive for older people.

Lupus affecting the kidneys is known as lupus nephritis, a kind of inflammation of the kidneys. About half of all people with lupus are affected by lupus nephritis. In children with lupus, about eight out of ten will have lupus nephritis.[19]', 'In lupus nephritis, inflammation inside the kidney causes glomerulonephritis and therefore nephritic syndrome.[20] In the early stages of this disorder and sometimes even later, there may be no symptoms of anything being wrong with the kidneys, although lupus nephritis may be diagnosed using urine tests and kidney biopsy at any time.[18] Lab tests in people with lupus nephritis show proteinuria and hematuria, even if they are asymptomatic.', 'Symptoms of lupus nephritis include:[19][21][20]', '\nEdema: puffiness or swelling in the feet, ankles, legs, hands, face and eyelids\nFoamy or red, brown, or pink urine\nWeight gain\nJoint pain or swelling in the joints\nHeadache\nDizziness\nBlood clotting problems\nHypertension (high blood pressure)\n', 'Foamy urine is a sign of proteinuria, or protein in the urine. Pink, red or brown urine is a sign of hematuria, i.e. blood in the urine. Muscle pain and a butterfly rash on the face may also occur, but these are general symptoms of lupus and not specific to lupus nephritis. For more information on the symptoms of lupus, see this resource.', 'Good to know: Lupus itself often affects the kidneys, but does not cause kidney infections in the same way that something like a urinary tract infection may. While Lupus nephritis is not itself a kidney infection, meaning it is not caused by bacteria, viruses or other infectious causes, medications used to treat lupus can suppress the immune system, potentially leading to an increased risk of infections of the kidneys. [20]', 'If you are concerned that you or a loved one may have lupus or a kidney problem, consult the Ada app for a free symptom assessment.', 'Diagnosing lupus nephritis', 'Diagnosis of lupus nephritis involves urine and blood tests and often  a kidney biopsy. Urine tests are used to measure the levels of protein, red blood cells and creatinine in the urine. High levels of creatinine indicate that the kidneys are not filtering wastes out of the blood very well. The same is true of high levels of protein in the urine. High levels of protein in the urine also may indicate that nephrotic syndrome is present.[19] A blood urea nitrogen, or BUN, test may also be done using a blood sample taken from a vein. This test will also be an indication of how compromised the filtering capabilities of the kidneys are.[22] A kidney biopsy, which is an outpatient procedure, will confirm the presence of lupus nephritis and determine how badly the kidneys are affected. In a kidney biopsy, a needle is used to take a small sample of kidney tissue, which will be sent to a laboratory for analysis.', 'Treatment of lupus nephritis', 'Lupus nephritis is usually treated using medication to reduce inflammation, decrease the severity of the body’s auto-immune response and prevent the body from attacking the kidneys. Commonly-used medications include:[23][24]', '\nCorticosteroids\nHydroxychloroquine\nCyclophosphamide\nMycophenolic acid\nAzathioprine\n', 'Managing the hypertension that accompanies nephritic syndrome in glomerulonephritis also requires medication, which can include:[19][25]', '\nACE inhibitors\nOther Diuretics\nBeta-blockers\nCalcium-channel blockers\n', 'The goal of treatment for lupus nephritis is to support kidney function and keep it as normal as possible, while preventing it from becoming worse.[21]', 'Treatment for lupus nephritis works well, so the prognosis is generally good. However, lupus nephritis can cause kidney function to decline as time goes by, and between 10-30 percent of people with lupus nephritis may develop kidney failure.[19] Very severe lupus nephritis may cause diffuse proliferative nephritis, which causes scarring to accumulate in the kidneys. This scarring causes kidney function to decline or, in the worst case, even fail.', 'Nephritic syndrome FAQs', 'Q: Is nephritic syndrome dangerous during pregnancy?\nA: Nephritic syndrome indicates a problem with the kidneys, which is of great concern for pregnant people, whose kidneys and other internal organs are already adapting to pregnancy and thus under increased demand. A doctor should be consulted without delay if symptoms occur. Acute nephritic syndrome poses certain health risks to both mother and baby. Chronic nephritic syndrome, though rarer, is also of concern. If nephrotic syndrome occurs, complications for both mother and baby may occur, even if renal function isn’t badly affected.[^11] Mothers may experience postnatal problems, such as edema, urinary tract infections and anemia.[26]  A doctor should be consulted as soon as possible.', 'Q: Can I take painkillers if I have or have had nephritic syndrome?\nA: There is some evidence that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) can worsen existing kidney damage or lead to kidney damage if used in high amounts exceeding the standard dosages over time. Normal dosages, when taken only as directed, are safe.[27] NSAIDs include diclofenac , celecoxib, etoricoxib, indometacin, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, high-dose aspirin (above 300mg per dose), mefenamic acid, and naproxen.[28]  High doses of NSAIDs over time can lead to chronic interstitial nephritis. Patients with kidney problems should use NSAIDs only under the direct supervision of a doctor.', 'Opioids such as morphine, hydrocodone or oxycodone, should generally be avoided, except in post-surgical or severe long-term pain, and would not ordinarily be prescribed by physicians due to their addictive properties.', 'Acetaminophen, also known as paracetamol, is generally a safe painkiller for use by people with kidney problems or suspected kidney problems. However, overuse of acetaminophen can lead to liver damage. Acetaminophen reduces pain and fever, but is not an anti-inflammatory.[29]', 'However, all patients should consult a doctor before taking NSAIDs or any other painkillers.', '', '\n\nUniversity of Tennessee Medical Centre. “Acute nephritic syndrome.” 22 September, 2015.

['Nephrolithiasis (Kidney Stones)'],"['Kidney stones, or nephrolithiasis, is a common condition in which hard collections, or calculi, form in the renal system, usually in the tube between the kidney and the bladder. These collections are the result of urine becoming saturated with minerals such as calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, struvite, uric acid or cystine.[1]', 'Common types of stone are:[2][3]', '\nCalcium oxalate stones\nCalcium phosphate stones\nUric acid stones\nStruvite stones\nCystine stones\n', 'Around 80 percent of all kidney stones, also called calculi, are calcium stones.[4]', 'These stones can vary in size from a few millimeters to a large staghorn shape a few centimeters in length.[1] Kidney calculi are more common in men than in women, and tend to occur in adults between the ages of 20 and 50. People between the ages of 35 and 45 are the most likely to be affected, but the disease can affect people of any age. It is rare to develop a stone for the first time over the age of 50.[5] Over half a million people in the US are affected by kidney stones every year.[5] Kidney stones are more common in whites and Asians than in people with African, Native American or African-American heritage.[3]', 'Symptoms occur when a stone leaves the kidney and enters the tighter ureter, the tube between the kidney and bladder, on its way to the bladder. A stone that is moving is much more painful than a stone that has not moved from its original place.[4]', 'Typical symptoms are severe pain in the back and belly, difficulty urinating and red or brown urine. Common treatment methods include good hydration, pain relief and anti-emetics. About 20% of patients require procedures such as  lithotripsy, breaking up the calculus with shock waves, to remove the stones, when kidney stones have caused pain, infection or obstruction. Most people recover fully, without any complications.']","['Typical symptoms are severe pain at the back and flank, difficulty urinating and passing only small amounts of urine at a time.

However, this does not mean that the stone is present in the testicles or in the groin.', 'Signs and symptoms of kidney stones in women', 'As stated above, men and women experience the symptoms of kidney stones in much the same way. The general symptoms of pain, nausea, fever, cloudy or bad-smelling urine, bloody urine, lack of urine or urinary retention, and stones or gravel in the urine will be experienced in the same way.', 'What does the pain from kidney stones feel like?', 'Pain is one of the most obvious symptoms of kidney stone obstructions. Where the pain is felt, and where it radiates to in the body, can indicate where the calculus is within the renal system. The pain that accompanies a kidney stone is felt acutely in the flank (the side) and radiates down the groin on the same side. Not all stones cause pain that spreads. Some stones may cause no pain at all.', 'Pain is caused not directly by the kidney stone itself, but instead it results from the effect that the stone has on the body by leading to muscle spasms, inflammation and irritation at and around the site of the obstruction.[5] Factors that influence how painful the kidney stone is, include:[4]', '\nWhether the stone is moving\nWhether it is twisted or tilted in the ureter or urethra\nWhether the obstruction is complete or partial\nWhere exactly it is in the renal system\nHow big the stone is\n', 'Good to know: Pain from kidney stones is often described as excruciating and intermittent, and often occurs in cycles that last between 20 minutes and an hour. People with painful kidney stones often cannot keep still because of the pain. They are often ashen, pale and sweaty, with a tender abdomen.[6]', 'Worried that you might have kidney stones? Ada is ready to start your free symptom assessment.', 'Risk factors and causes of kidney stones', 'Kidney stones are more common in men, and in adults between 20 and 50 years of age, but very rare in children. It is most common in adults who have a low fluid intake and consequently produce little urine, which can contain high amounts of stone-forming substances.[7]', 'Kidney stones are also more common in people who have gout (in the case of uric acid stones), or who have a family member who also suffers from kidney stones. The genes that can increase a person’s chance of developing nephrolithiasis have been identified.[7]', 'Infections of the urinary tract may lead to kidney stones. Other general risk factors are dehydration and being overweight or obese.', 'Other risk factors include:[1][5][8][9]', '\nAnatomical abnormalities such as horseshoe kidney or ureteral stricture\nHyperparathyroidism, i.e. an overactive parathyroid gland\nMetabolic disorders, such as hypercalciuria, hyperuricosuria or chronic metabolic acidosis\nIntestinal problems such as Crohn’s Disease\nBariatric (weight-loss) surgery), such as a sleeve gastrectomy or a gastric bypass\nLiving in a hot climate  and its risk of dehydration\nToo much exercise and its risk of dehydration\nToo little exercise and its risk of obesity\nA diet high in protein, salt or sugar, especially fructose and sucrose\n', 'Some medications can increase the risk of forming kidney stones.

Struvite stones are more common in women than in men,[3] and are responsible for between 1 and 5 percent percent of kidney stones.[1] They will reoccur if the underlying UTI is not treated.[6]', 'Kidney stones caused by uric acid are associated with acidic urine, usually with a pH of below 5.5.[4] These account for only around 10% percent of stones and are often associated with gout. Chemotherapy for conditions such as leukemia and lymphoma, as well as these conditions themselves, which increase tissue breakdown, may also lead to the urine becoming more acidic.', 'If you are experiencing symptoms such as those listed above, and are concerned that the cause may be kidney stones, try a free Ada symptom assessment.', 'Diet and kidney stones', 'It is generally thought that certain foods can increase risk of developing some kinds of kidney stones. These include animal protein from meats or fish, in the case of uric acid stones, and some vegetables, drinks and nuts in the case of calcium oxalate stones .[5][4] Excessive salt and excessive sucrose and fructose intake have in some studies also been shown to overall increase the risk of stones forming, and should therefore be avoided in excess and only consumed in moderation.', 'Calcium oxalate stones and diet', 'People who have had calcium oxalate stones in the past or who have a high rate of oxalate excretion should reduce consumption of certain foods and food types, including:[10]', '\nRhubarb\nSpinach\nCocoa\nTea\nNuts\nVitamin C\n', 'Uric acid stones and diet', 'High intake of purine in the diet causes the body to produce large amounts of monosodium urate.

In cases where cystine stones develop, the urine is saturated to above a certain level with cystine , causing crystals to be deposited and stones to form.[4]', 'Diagnosing kidney stones', 'Diagnosis of kidney stones is often based on the typical symptoms and physical examination. A urine dipstick test may show blood and pus in the urine, and help confirm the presence of a kidney stone.', 'A person being examined for kidney stones will be asked about their medical history and will be physically examined. They will also be given a computerised tomography (CT) scan. X-rays and ultrasound tests can determine the presence of stones, but CT scans are preferred during the diagnostic process, because they can determine the size and location of the stone. MRI scans are not generally helpful.[6] In pregnant women; a kidney ultrasound is usually ordered. An ultrasound of the kidneys and ureters is also often used to diagnose kidney stones in children, although in some cases a CT scan may also be needed.[13]', 'The overall health of the kidneys may be tested using:[2][4]', '\n24-hour urine collection test, once the patient is free of stones,  to measure changes in the values for urinary electrolytes, reduced urine volume and to determine the underlying metabolic cause for nephrolithiasis\nBlood tests, if the person is feverish and may have an infection\n', 'The calculus/kidney stone will be analysed after it has been passed in the urine or extracted during surgery.[6]', 'People with the following conditions may need further tests, as determined by their physicians:[6]', '\nSarcoidosis\nMyeloma\nBone metastases\nSolitary kidney\nUrinary tract anomalies\n', 'Treatment of kidney stones', 'The treatment of kidney stones varies depending  on the size of the kidney stone and the severity of the symptoms.

Stones with a diameter of less than 10mm that are in the distal ureter and do not have complications such as infection, should be removed if they have not passed on their own within four to six weeks.[14] This can involve lithotripsy (breaking up the stone with shock waves), or the surgical removal of stones, or the removal of the stone with an endoscope, a small tube with a camera and surgical tools.', 'Shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) is a non-invasive procedure where sound waves are used to break the stones into fragments small enough to pass through the ureter and out of the body through the urethra. If lithotripsy is not used, other endoscopic methods are possible, such as uteroscopic lithotripsy (URS) or percutaneous nephrostomy.', 'In uteroscopic lithotripsy, an endoscope is introduced to the urethra and moves through the bladder into the ureter to the stone’s location. The stone is then removed. In cases where access to the urethra is complicated because of an enlarged prostate, the endoscope will be introduced via a small incision in the bladder.', 'In a percutaneous nephrostomy, an endoscope is introduced via a small incision in the skin of the flank, directly into the kidney.', 'Some very large or complicated stones may need open surgery.', 'Struvite stones must be removed, as they are infectious or infected foreign bodies. The stones will reoccur if the urinary tract infection that underlies their formation is not resolved.[6]', 'Preventing kidney stones', 'Preventing kidney stones from forming involves changing the diet of the affected person and increasing the amount of fluid, preferably clear fluids such as water, that they consume . In all cases, it is important to remain well hydrated, consuming about 2.5 quarts of water each day.[8] It is also important to limit sugar and salt in the diet and to eat a diet high in fruit and vegetables.[5] In cases where the person is overweight, they should lose the excess weight.', 'Good to know: High-animal protein diets and crash diets should be avoided, as they can unbalance the pH and chemical makeup of urine.[5] For more information, see the section on prevention of kidney stones, above.', 'In calcium oxalate stones, which are the most common kind, prevention measures include diets that are low in salt, sugars and animal protein,[6] and reduced consumption of oxalate-rich foods.[8]', 'People who are concerned about the role their diets may play in the formation of kidney stones, should consult their physicians, specialist nephrologists and/or a dietitian.', 'Good to know: Low-calcium diets are not indicated for the prevention of calcium oxalate stones, as low calcium diets cause oxalate reabsorption to increase.[8]', 'In cases of uric acid stones, allopurinol will be prescribed to prevent high levels of uric acid building up in the blood. Alkalinizing agents may also be prescribed to make urine more alkaline.', 'FAQs', 'Q: Do kidney stones recur once they have been treated? \nA: Yes. People who have had a kidney stone, have a 50 percent chance of developing another stone within five to seven years.[5] Maintaining high fluid intake, as well as making dietary changes and maintaining a healthy weight, can help postpone the recurrence of stones.[4]', 'Q: Can kidney stones cause long-term kidney damage?\nA: Yes. Complications can occur, in some cases within hours, that can be serious in themselves. These include sepsis and high fever. Struvite stones, as noted above, are the result of an underlying UTI, which could potentially cause long-term damage if left untreated. In some cases, pyelonephritis may result if kidney stone obstructions are left untreated, and renal damage may be permanent.', 'Q: What are the complications of kidney stones?\nA: Complications include:', '\nRecurrent urinary tract infections\nUrosepsis\nAcute kidney injury\nGlomerular damage\nChronic kidney disease\n', 'Q: What is the difference between kidney stones and bladder stones?\nA: Kidney stones develop in the kidneys and move into the ureter, bladder and urethra. Bladder stones develop in the bladder. Bladder stones make up about 5 percent of all calculi found in the renal system. They are usually the result of foreign bodies, infection and obstruction, and the most common cause of bladder stones is urinary stasis. The majority of bladder stones occur in men who have bladder outflow problems, which cause urine to remain in the bladder after urination.[1]', 'Q: What are some common foods that contain high levels of oxalate and may therefore need to be eaten only in very low amounts or not at all?\nA: It is best to speak to a physician or dietitian before adding or eliminating foods. Not every case of kidney stones has the same cause, and therefore some of the foods listed below may not be relevant to the disease. Furthermore, this list is not exhaustive.', 'Some fruits, vegetable and processed foods are high in oxalate; oxalate is involved in the formation of the most common kind of stones, calcium oxalate stones. These  foods include rhubarb, spinach, beetroot, avocado, oranges, raspberries, dates, grapefruit and kiwi fruit. Nuts and nut butter may also be best avoided by some people. Bran flakes and potato chips may also be problematic.[15][16]', 'Q: Can coffee, tea or other caffeinated drinks cause kidney stones?\nA: Coffee and tea, in fact, reduce the risk of developing kidney stones, and this is true of both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee and tea. Caffeinated drinks have a somewhat diuretic effect, which has a protective effect, while decaffeinated drinks could possibly have a protective effect due to the antioxidant chemicals they contain.[17]', 'Research has revealed that drinking coffee may have several different possible effects - some contrasting each other - on a person’s likelihood of developing kidney stones. Studies have shown that consuming caffeine actually increases the amount of calcium that is excreted in the urine, which should in fact increase the risk of developing calcium oxalate kidney stones [18] , which are the most common type of kidney stones. However, despite this, consuming coffee generally appears to lower the risk of kidney stones.[19]', 'Q: Can alcohol cause kidney stones?\nA: Beer and red wine may in fact lower the risk of developing kidney stones.[17] It is not certain whether any other alcoholic beverages such as whiskey, rye, bourbon or vodka  may have a similarly protective effect, and this should therefore not be assumed. However, there are many psychological and physical health risks associated with alcohol consumption, for example, alcohol dependency and liver disease like liver cirrhosis.', 'Q: Can sports/energy drinks or soft drinks cause kidney stones?\nA: There is some evidence that the degree to which one is consuming soft drinks or sports/energy drinks contributes to increasing one’s risk of developing kidney stones, but this depends on what is used to sweeten the drink.', 'Fructose is a natural sugar used to sweeten soft drinks, fruit punch, and sports drinks and it is associated with the development of gout and kidney stones, as well as obesity. While some studies have shown that fructose consumption has only a limited effect on the excretion of uric acid,[20] fructose has been shown to increase the amount of calcium, oxalate and uric acid that the body excretes in the urine.', 'It is possible that drinking a fructose-sweetened soda once a day increases the risk of developing kidney stones, compared to drinking artificially-sweetened soda or sports drinks.[17] Furthermore, some studies have shown that cola-based soft drinks increase the risk of developing kidney stones more than non-cola sodas.[17]', 'Q: How are gout and kidney stones related?\nA: Both gout and some kinds of kidney stones can be caused by high levels of uric acid in the body,[21] and there is some evidence that kidney stones and chronic kidney disease are both more common in people who have gout.[22] For more information, see this resource on gout and this resource on podagra (gout affecting the big toe).', 'Q: Can kidney stones develop after bariatric surgery?\nA: Yes; it is relatively common for someone who has had bariatric surgery to develop kidney stones. Bariatric surgery can help decrease the risk of sleep apnea, hypertension and diabetes in overweight people who have had the surgery, but some types of bariatric surgery do affect the way that the body processes nutrients.[23] It is also possible that the same factors that made bariatric surgery, such as diabetes, necessary in the first place may contribute to the risk of developing kidney stones afterwards.[23]', 'Q: Does a prostatectomy increase your risk of developing kidney stones?\nA: No. Removal of the prostate does not affect kidney function, and therefore cannot increase your risk of developing kidney stones.', 'Q: Do gallstones and/or gallbladder removal increase your risk of developing kidney stones?\nA: Kidney stones and gallstones are not directly related, but studies have shown that people who have gallstones may also be at higher risk of developing kidney stones and vice versa.[24] The processes that cause gallstones may be related to the processes that cause kidney stones. However, how nephrolithiasis and cholelethiasis interact isn’t yet well studied or -understood.', 'Q: What color are kidney stones?\nA: The composition of kidney stones affects what color they are. Because the colors can vary, it is not always possible to correctly identify what kind of stone has caused the problem just by looking at it; in most cases, stones will be sent away for laboratory analysis. However, speaking broadly, the colors stones come in include:[25][26]', '\nCalcium oxalate: black or dark brown\nCalcium phosphate: dirty white or yellowish\nUric acid: ranging from yellowish and brownish to red or orange\nStruvite: dirty white or yellowish\nCystine: pinkish or yellowish, often with a grainy outer surface.\n', 'It is possible to have more than one sort of stone, and it is also possible for stones to be made up of more than one kind of substance.', 'Other names for nephrolithiasis', '\nUreterolithiasis\nUreteral stone\nKidney stones\n', '', '\n\nPatient.info. “Urinary Tract Stones”.

Small stones usually pass with no need for medical assistance. Drinking plenty of water may help to flush the stone from the urinary system.', 'Pain medication is often needed while passing a renal calculus. In severe cases, opiates may be prescribed. However, in most cases, acetaminophen/paracetamol is usually sufficient.[1][5] 80 percent of stones pass without serious medical intervention and needing no inpatient treatment. About 20 percent lead to situations that require hospitalization.[4]', 'People may need to be admitted to hospital if the following factors are present:[1]', '\nAnuria, when the kidneys do not produce urine\nFever\nPersistent or severe pain\nInadequate fluid intake as a result of nausea or vomiting, resulting in dehydration\nPoor social support while they are living alone at home\nInability to access follow-up outpatient care\nPregnancy\nBeing older than 60 years of age\n', 'Good to know: If a fever is present, infection may also be present. Because infection can be very serious, the affected person should receive medical treatment as soon as possible.[1]', 'Treatment at home may be possible for most people, because most stones smaller than 5mm pass on their own and do not cause infection or need surgical help to pass.

Painkillers, such as morphine may be used to control severe pain; moderate or mild pain can be controlled with acetaminophen or codeine. Antibiotics are only used in cases where an infection has developed.[4]', 'Other medications used to treat uric acid kidney calculi are:[4]', '\nUricosuric agents, which increase the amount of uric acid excreted\nAlkalinizing agents, such as sodium bicarbonate and potassium citrate\n', 'Surgery for kidney stones', 'Big stones, with a diameter of more than 10mm and which are lodged in the ureter, might need assistance to pass, especially if they are blocking the passage of urine. Stones with a diameter of less than 10mm that are in the distal ureter and do not have complications such as infection, should be removed if they have not passed on their own within four to six weeks.[14] This can involve lithotripsy (breaking up the stone with shock waves), or the surgical removal of stones, or the removal of the stone with an endoscope, a small tube with a camera and surgical tools.', 'Shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) is a non-invasive procedure where sound waves are used to break the stones into fragments small enough to pass through the ureter and out of the body through the urethra. If lithotripsy is not used, other endoscopic methods are possible, such as uteroscopic lithotripsy (URS) or percutaneous nephrostomy.', 'In uteroscopic lithotripsy, an endoscope is introduced to the urethra and moves through the bladder into the ureter to the stone’s location. The stone is then removed. In cases where access to the urethra is complicated because of an enlarged prostate, the endoscope will be introduced via a small incision in the bladder.', 'In a percutaneous nephrostomy, an endoscope is introduced via a small incision in the skin of the flank, directly into the kidney.', 'Some very large or complicated stones may need open surgery.', 'Struvite stones must be removed, as they are infectious or infected foreign bodies.

['Nephrotic Syndrome'],"['Nephrotic syndrome is a collection of signs and symptoms which indicate that there is a problem with the kidneys. It is a syndrome rather than a disease. A syndrome is a group of symptoms that often occur together and develop as a result of another condition.', 'There can be various underlying conditions or problems, all of which require specific treatment. It can occur among adults and children, but is most common among children aged between 18 months and four years.[1] In children, boys are more commonly affected than girls.', 'While the prognosis is usually quite good,  nephrotic syndrome can become severe and even potentially life-threatening, if left untreated. The degree of severity depends on the underlying cause.', 'The major symptoms of nephrotic syndrome include:', '\nThe excretion of abnormally large amounts of protein, especially albumin, in the urine, known as proteinuria generally and albuminuria specifically.\nReduced levels of protein in the blood.\nConsequent edema, abnormal accumulations of fluid.\n', 'Hypertension (high blood pressure) and thrombotic events (blood clots) may also be present, as might hyperlipidemia, a high level of lipids in the blood.', 'Causes of nephrotic syndrome include kidney damage from nephrotoxic drugs, systemic disorders such as diabetes or lupus, or diseases affecting the kidneys directly, such as glomerulonephritis.[2] In children, most cases of nephrotic syndrome are caused by minimal change disease (MCD).', 'Treating nephrotic syndrome usually involves managing hypertension and hyperlipidemia, as well as alleviating edema and arresting the loss of protein in the urine. This can be done with diet and antihypertensive medications. If the nephrotic syndrome is caused by minimal change disease, steroids may be used as part of treatment.[2]', 'How is nephrotic syndrome different to nephritic syndrome?', 'Nephritic syndrome is an inflammatory kidney disorder that is sometimes confused with nephrotic syndrome during initial diagnosis. However, there are several clear differences that are differentiated during laboratory testing. While nephritic syndrome is characterised by inflammation and hematuria (blood in urine), nephrotic syndrome is mostly characterised by proteinuria.', 'Of the two, nephrotic syndrome is often the more serious, depending on the underlying cause.  In both cases, medical assistance should be sought out as quickly as possible. The free Ada app can also be used to carry out a symptom assessment.']",,"['Nephrotic syndrome is not a disease in itself, but rather a sign that something else is wrong in the body. Underlying conditions that can cause nephrotic syndrome can be primary, originating in the kidneys, or secondary, originating elsewhere in the body. Primary causes include:[1][3][4]', '\nMinimal change disease, which can cause proteinuria, mostly found among children\nFocal segmental glomerulosclerosis, which causes scarring of the glomeruli\nMembranous nephropathy, which occurs when the glomeruli become thickened and damaged\n', 'Secondary causes include:[1][5][6]', '\nDiabetic nephropathy, which results from long-term high levels of blood glucose\nPre-eclampsia\nAmyloidosis, a bone-marrow disorder that causes malformed protein chains, mostly found among older adults\nHIV-associated nephropathy\n', 'Some drugs may lead to kidney damage, causing glomerulonephritis, which may then lead to nephrotic syndrome. Nephrotoxic drugs that can cause kidney damage in children include:[7]', '\nCyclosporine\nAminoglycoside antibiotics\nCisplatin\nAmphotericin B\nBeta-lactam antibiotics\nIndomethacin\n', 'It should be noted that the circumstances in which these drugs can become nephrotoxic vary from case to case.', 'Other drugs that can be nephrotoxic include:[8]', '\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\nRadiocontrast media\nAntirheumatic drugs\nAnticancer drugs\n', 'In cases where drugs are implicated in nephrotic syndrome, symptoms usually improve once the drug concerned is discontinued.', 'Symptoms and complications of nephrotic syndrome', 'Symptoms of nephrotic syndrome include:[1][9][10]', '\nAppetite loss\nMalaise, a general feeling of unwellness\nFrothy urine due to proteinuria\nEdema (accumulated fluid under the skin, which may appear as weight gain)\nHyperlipidemia (high cholesterol)\nHypertension (high blood pressure)\nHypoalbuminia and albuminaria, low blood levels and high urine levels of the protein albumin.\n', 'Proteinuria and edema are the two most distinctive symptoms of nephrotic disorder.', 'Proteinuria', 'In a healthy kidney, small groupings of capillaries, known as glomeruli, filter the blood. The glomerulus and nearby waste tube, known as a tubule, together make up a structure called a nephron.[11]', 'In the nephron, the glomerulus filters the blood. Substances needed by the body, such as potassium, protein and phosphorus, return to the blood, while waste products pass through a membrane into the tubule.  Waste products pass from the tubule to the ureter, and are eventually eliminated in the urine. If the tubule, glomerulus, or both, become damaged or infected, this filtration system becomes unbalanced. Waste products may build up in the body, and necessary substances such as proteins and minerals may be lost.[11]', 'In glomerular disorders, such as those that lead to nephrotic syndrome, the membrane between the glomerulus and the tubule loses its ability to prevent protein molecules and red blood cells from passing out into the tubule.[12]', 'Healthy glomeruli allow less than 400mg of protein into urine per day. In nephrotic syndrome, three grams or more of protein pass into the urine and are lost through excretion, causing blood protein levels to fall.[2] Nephrotic range proteinuria is defined as 3.5 or more grams of protein lost in urine over a twenty-four hour period.[9] This is roughly twenty times the amount of protein a healthy glomerulus would allow through.', 'This has various cascading effects on the body, as the protein loss causes low levels of blood protein. Because blood protein is vital to the absorption and elimination of extra fluid from the body’s tissues, low levels of protein result in a buildup of fluids in the tissues, known as edema.', 'Glomerulonephritis is the most common cause for nephrotic syndrome. One specific subtype of glomerulonephritis, membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN), is the most common cause for nephrotic syndrome in adults.', 'Specifically, glomerulonephritis is damage to the glomerulus, often the result of attack by the body’s own immune system. It can also be the result of a streptococcal\nInfection or other underlying conditions. While some cases of glomerulonephritis clear up on their own, others may take longer. In cases where the glomerulonephritis becomes chronic, long-term damage to the kidneys may occur.[13]', 'In MGN, also know as membranous nephropathy, the small membrane between the tubule and the glomerulus is especially affected which causes the loss of protein. In most cases, no cause for this damage can be found, but it is suggested that it is a result of an autoimmune attack on the glomeruli. This is called primary MGN. Secondary MGN can be caused by NSAIDs, Hepatitis B, systemic lupus erythematosus, cancer or others.', 'Edema', 'In nephrotic syndrome, the lack of protein leads to a buildup of fluid made up of sodium and water in the tissues. It is usually found in the lower legs, but can build up around the lungs.[14] This is known as pleural effusion, and if this happens, the affected person may experience breathlessness. If fluid builds up in the abdominal cavity (ascites), it may be uncomfortable. Ascites, in particular, can lead to an increased abdominal circumference and a feeling of heaviness and discomfort. Most of the time, however, edema is generally not serious, although it can cause joint and abdominal pain.', 'Complications of nephrotic syndrome', 'Nephrotic syndrome can cause complications due to the way it unbalances bodily systems. Complications can include:[1][9][14][15]', '\nBlood clots (hypercoagulability), which occur because of abnormal protein levels in the blood\nCoronary artery disease (in adults)\nThrombosis in the lungs, limbs or brain\nHigh cholesterol (hyperlipidemia or hypercholesterolemia), due to changes in blood composition resulting from protein loss\nAcute kidney injury (sudden, temporary loss of kidney function)\nAnemia, due to iron no longer being adequately transported in the blood\nInfections, such as cellulitis, pneumonia, meningitis and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, which result from loss of immunoglobulins. Medications used to treat these infections can themselves be nephrotoxic.\nHypothyroidism\nProtein undernutrition (in children)\nHematuria (blood in the urine)\nSevere azotemia, high levels of nitrogen compounds in the blood\n', 'Hypercoagulability and hyperlipidemia are the result of abnormal protein synthesis. As albumin is lost in the urine, the liver compensates by producing more. But because protein synthesis is nonspecific, and not all proteins are being lost in the urine, the levels of some proteins actually rise in the blood.', 'Good to know: Hypoalbuminemia (low albumin) can also manifest as white bands in the nails, known as Muerkhe’s Lines.[16]', 'People experiencing symptoms that may be linked to a complication of nephrotic syndrome can carry out a symptom assessment using the free Ada app now.', 'Diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome', 'Nephrotic syndrome is initially diagnosed using urine testing, as well as a physical examination. Visible edema is considered a sign that kidney function might be disturbed, but urine tests for protein generally, and albumin in particular, are considered specific tests.[16]', 'Albumin levels can be determined by a dipstick test, but a larger urine sample is needed if diagnosis if to be confirmed. Formerly, a twenty-four hour collection of the affected person’s urine would be tested for albumin, but this is considered less efficient than a single-sample test, and is being phased out.[14]', 'The most common urine test performed by medical professionals is a test on a single urine sample gathered first thing upon waking. This test measures albumin and creatinine in ratio. A ratio of 30mg of albumin to one gram of creatinine signals that there is a problem.[9] Urine samples will also be checked for cell casts and lipids.[1]', 'Depending on the result of the urine test, blood tests will be carried out to determine what the underlying cause of the nephrotic syndrome might be. While these tests can usually isolate secondary causes, a kidney biopsy may also be needed to diagnose primary causes.[9]', 'Blood tests for underlying causes may include:[1]', '\nHbA1c to determine whether diabetes is present.\nHepatitis B and C tests\nRheumatoid factor\nHIV antibody tests\nSerologic syphilis tests\n', 'In children, treatment with steroids is often begun without waiting for biopsy results. This is because nephrotic syndrome is usually the result of minimal change disease. Biopsy may be likewise unnecessary in the case of adults with diabetes, given that diabetic nephropathy is a very common underlying cause.[10]', 'Treatment of nephrotic syndrome', 'Treatment of nephrotic syndrome usually involves a combination of supportive treatment intended to alleviate symptoms such as proteinuria, hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and treatment of the underlying cause.[2] Steps should also be taken to prevent possible complications. Treatment is broadly the same, whatever the underlying cause.[16]', 'While some cases of nephrotic syndrome go into remission whether or not treatment is administered, it is generally not advisable to wait and see, and medical advice should be sought without delay.[10] Prognosis in cases of nephrotic syndrome is generally good, but this depends on the underlying cause and how effectively it is treated.', 'Treatment may include:[2][1][9]', '\nAngiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors\nAngiotensin receptor blockers (ARB)\nSalt/sodium restriction in the diet\nDiuretics to reduce blood pressure and edema\nStatins to lower cholesterol\n', 'ACEs and ARBs lower blood pressure, which reduces the pressure inside the glomeruli. They also prevent protein loss in the urine. Increasing protein consumption in the diet does not alleviate protein loss and is not advised. Blood-thinning medications should only be prescribed if the affected person has had a blood clot already. If possible, people with nephrotic syndrome should be vaccinated against pneumococcal disease.[9]', 'Nephrotic syndrome FAQs', 'Q: What is the link between non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and nephrotic syndrome?\nA: In recent years, doctors have seen an increase in the number of cases of kidney injury and nephrotic syndrome resulting from long-term use of NSAIDs. It is most often found in adults, usually in more senior people, but is also possible among children.[17]. Younger adults are seldom affected.[18] In most cases, the situation improves when use of the drug is discontinued.[19] However, in rare cases, chronic renal insufficiency may occur.', 'It is likely that NSAIDs, which reduce blood-flow to the kidneys, can, in some instances, change the permeability of the membrane that separates the glomerulus from the tubule in the nephron, leading to nephrotic syndrome.[19]  NSAIDs can also cause lesions in the kidneys, leading to a problem known as acute interstitial nephritis (AIN).[20]', 'Q: What are NSAIDs?\nA: NSAIDs are a class of medications that are commonly sold over the- counter and reduce pain and inflammation. For this reason, they are often used to relieve headaches, fever and pain from mild injuries. NSAIDs work by blocking the actions of an enzyme known as cyclooxygenase, which reduces prostaglandins in the body. Prostaglandins promote inflammation, pain and fever. Thus, if they are blocked, those symptoms are reduced. However, because prostaglandins also protect the stomach, long-term use of NSAIDs can also cause stomach ulcers.', 'The list of medications classified as NSAIDs includes:[21]', '\nIbuprofen\nAspirin\nDiclofenac\nCelecoxib\nKetoprofen\nNaproxen\nIndomethacin\nOxaprozin\nPiroxicam\n', 'Many over-the-counter NSAIDs come packaged with a warning not to use them continuously for more than ten days without consulting a primary care physician. If your pain does not respond well to NSAIDs, seek further medical advice.', 'Q: If I have nephrotic syndrome, will I need to have dialysis?\nA: Dialysis is typically only necessary for people whose kidney function has fallen too low for the body to adequately eliminate its own waste products. Many people who need dialysis only need it temporarily. However, depending on the cause of the renal failure, some people may need dialysis for the foreseeable future, until a kidney transplant becomes possible, or for the rest of their lives. As nephrotic syndrome is a sign of a greater underlying problem, whether you will need dialysis depends on the underlying condition.[2]', 'People with diabetic nephropathy, chronic kidney disease, chronic glomerulonephritis or polycystic kidney disease may all develop kidney failure and need long-term dialysis.[22] Those with acute kidney failure may only need dialysis for the short-term.', '', '\n\nMSD Manuals. “Overview of Nephrotic Syndrome” January 2018.

The exact cause of this condition is unknown, but it is not caused by a bacterial infection. It is most common in older men who have an enlarged prostate. Common symptoms include pain in the area between the scrotum and anus, pain when ejaculating and, sometimes, blood in the urine or semen.

['Obstructive Sleep Apnea'],"['Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a condition in which relaxation of the throat muscles cause blockage of the airways while sleeping. This causes people to have interrupted sleep because they have difficulty breathing. This condition tends to affect adults between the ages of 30 or 60. A major cause of this condition is obesity. People with obstructive sleep apnea often snore loudly while sleeping, and find that they feel unusually tired or even sleepy during the day. The diagnosis can be confirmed by undergoing a sleep study, which monitors for signs of breathing problems while sleeping. The treatment of obstructive sleep apnea depends on the severity of symptoms, and lifestyle changes can be very effective to reduce or manage symptoms. With active management, many people see an improvement in their symptoms.']","['The most common symptom is loud snoring with labored and interrupted breathing while sleeping. During these episodes, people may appear to wake up a little bit, and begin to breath again. This interrupted sleep may cause daytime sleepiness, difficulty concentrating, memory problems, headaches and irritability. In children, the symptoms may be less obvious, but may include learning and behavior problems.']",,"['Treatment for this condition involves lifestyle changes and devices which help to keep the airways open. People with obstructive sleep apnea can improve their symptoms by losing weight, reducing their use of cigarettes and alcohol, by taking regular exercise and avoiding sleeping on the back. In some cases an oral device or mouthpiece can help to keep the throat open. In more severe cases, a machine that delivers air through the nose and mouth can help to prevent the airways from becoming blocked. Surgery is usually considered only if other treatments failed.']"
['Onychomycosis (Fungal Nail Infection)'],"['Onychomycosis (also known as tinea unguium) is a fungal infection affecting the toenails and fingernails, which occurs in about 10 percent of adults in the United States.[1] Onychomycosis more commonly affects toenails over fingernails.', 'The infected nail usually becomes thick and discoloured, a process which starts at the tip of the nail and progresses downwards towards the root. Infected nails may become crumbly, and it is not uncommon for part or all of the infected nail to break off. Treatment usually involves keeping the nail clean and taking a course of antimycotic (antifungal) medication.']","['The first signs of a fungal nail infection are usually perceptible changes to the appearance of the nail(s). It is uncommon for an infected nail to cause severe pain or permanent disfigurement, but this does occur in some cases. If left untreated, fungal nail infections can cause difficulties with walking, exercising or manual tasks such as typing. The main symptoms of onychomycosis include the nail becoming:', '_ Brittle\n_ Broken\n_ Discoloured\n_ Thickened\n_ Flaky\n_ Lifted\n_ Painful\n_ Separated from the nail bed', 'These symptoms could also indicate that an individual is suffering from nail psoriasis, a chronic autoimmune skin disease which can affect the skin under the nail. Nail psoriasis is more common in the fingernails than the toenails and can co-occur with fungal infections of the nail.', 'Types of onychomycosis', 'Onychomycosis is usually caused by a buildup of dermatophyte fungi. These are parasitic fungi  infecting the skin and nails, which need to reside in human or animal bodies in order to survive. Fungal infections of the nail are caused when dermatophytes burrow under the nails to breed.', 'Specific types of dermatophytes which commonly cause fungal nail infections include the trichophyton rubrum, the most common type of fungus to infect the nails, and trichophyton interdigitale fungi. Other fungi which can cause fungal nail infections include yeasts, such as the candida albicans and molds, such as scopulariopsis brevicaulis.', 'The rarest form of fungal nail infection is called proximal subungual onychomycosis. Infection usually involves the trichophyton rubrum fungus and occurs, initially, at the proximal nail fold (the base of the nail), spreading up the newly developed nail plate. This form of infection usually occurs in people whose immune system is compromised. Proximal subungual onychomycosis is a clinical marker for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).[2]']",,"['Fungal nail infections do not get better spontaneously, so a course of treatment is always required. This usually involves a combined approach of keeping the affected nails clean to reduce irritation and inflammation, at the same time as following a course of antifungal medication. Onychomycosis is highly infectious, so it is important to begin treatment as soon as possible to minimise the risk of passing the infection to others.', 'Prevention and management', 'There are various precautions that one can take in order to reduce the risk of spreading fungal nail infections to others and to increase the chances of a quick recovery. To look after one’s nails and prevent the spread of infection, it is recommended to:', '\nChange one’s socks and shoes regularly\nDry one’s hands and feet as soon as possible after exposure to water\nFile one’s nails to keep the edges smooth\nMoisturise one’s hands, nails and cuticles daily and after contact with liquids\nSelect shoes and socks made of natural materials, such as cotton\nTreat skin infections like Athlete’s Foot promptly to avoid the infection reaching the nails\nTrim nails regularly\nUse separate scissors or clippers to tend to infected nails\nWear clean, comfortable shoes\nWear gloves for housework and other manual tasks\n', 'Medications', 'In addition to keeping the site of the infection clean, someone affected by a fungal nail infection may be prescribed topical antimycotics, i.e.antifungal products to apply to the affected area.

This treatment is usually recommended for severe or persistent nail infections. It can be carried out during a regular appointment at the doctor’s office. If the nail is removed surgically, a local anaesthetic will be applied to the affected area to ensure that the affected person will not feel pain, before the infected part of the nail is removed using a tool.[4]', 'An advantage of surgical removal is that it can be carried out in one appointment, and then the course of topical antimycotic medication can be started. Alternatively, a dressing containing urea can be applied to the affected nail. This must be kept dry for 10 days, during which time the urea will soften the nail, so that it can be removed painlessly by the doctor during a follow-up appointment.', 'After the nail is removed, if this is needed, topical medications can then be applied with best results. The infection is considered to have cleared up when the new, healthy nail starts to show visible regrowth in the nail bed.', 'Medications that can be applied directly to the affected area are the first-line treatment for fungal nail infections, primarily because they do not carry the risk of having the side effects that can accompany the use of oral antifungal medications (medications designed to be swallowed), which include:[5]', '\nItching\nHeadaches\nDiarrhea\nA decreased sense of taste\n', 'Courses of oral antimycotics for fungal nail infections typically last for between 6 and 12 weeks, allowing enough time for a healthy nail to grow and replace the infected one. The most common oral antimycotics for onychomycosis are itraconazole and terbinafine, which work by gradually killing the fungi that caused the infection.', 'The doctor will assess a person’s medical history before prescribing these medications, as they may not be suitable for everyone. People who have had liver problems should avoid terbinafine. Itraconazole has been linked to compromised heart function and may react with other medications, including pimozide, quinidine, dofetilide and levacetylmethadol (levomethadyl).']"
['Open Angle Glaucoma'],"['Open-angle glaucoma, or primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), is a condition in which pressure inside the eye causes damage to the delicate tissue and nerves on the inside of the eye. Over time, this affects the ability to see and can cause blindness.', 'Glaucoma is a common disorder of the eye and is the second most common cause of blindness worldwide. Open-angle glaucoma is one of several types of glaucoma. Open-angle glaucoma most commonly affects adults and becomes more common with age. The exact cause is not well understood, but several factors may combine to cause this condition. Most people have no symptoms until significant damage to the eye has occurred. At this point, people with glaucoma notice that they cannot see clearly, especially at the sides of their vision.', 'Open-angle glaucoma can be treated with medications, laser therapy or surgery. If left untreated, it eventually results in blindness.', 'Effects of open-angle glaucoma', 'Open-angle glaucoma occurs when pressure inside the eye causes damage to the tissue and nerves inside the eye. This most commonly happens when pressure inside the eye increases, but can, in rare cases, occur with normal eye pressure. Pressure on the delicate tissues and nerves at the back of the eye causes damage and vision problems.']","['Open-angle glaucoma does not produce any early symptoms, therefore many people are unaware that they are affected. Because the vision loss that results from glaucoma tends to affect peripheral vision first, the unaffected eye may be able to compensate for the vision loss in the affected eye.[1] This gives the impression that vision loss is not occuring.[2]', 'Over time, however, both eyes become affected. When approximately 40 percent of the optic nerve fibres are damaged, the vision loss becomes noticeable.[3] Vision in the central field is usually the last to be affected.', 'For this reason, screening for glaucoma is extremely important.

Lowering intraocular pressure by 20 to 40 percent is the only treatment for open angle glaucoma.[3][5]', 'Eye drops are a common form of first-line treatment.', 'The eye drops may contain beta-blockers, which reduce the aqueous output of the eye.[3][5] People who are already using systemic beta-blockers should ideally use eye drops containing beta-blockers from a different class. Other drugs that can be administered as eye drops include various prostaglandin analogs, which increase the outflow of aqueous humor.[3][5] Cholinesterase inhibitors, cholinesterase agonists and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may also be used.[5] Oral osmotic diuretics, such as glycerin and mannitol, may also be prescribed. These work by drawing fluid from the eye into the bloodstream. All of these can be used as first-line therapy, depending on what other medications the affected person is already using and their tolerance of side-effects.', 'Surgical intervention may be necessary in some cases. Options for surgery include:[2][3][5]', '\nLaser trabeculoplasty may be used as the first surgical option for patients who do not respond well to eye drops, or if eye drops have successfully reduced intraocular pressure without arresting optic nerve degeneration. In these procedures, a laser is used to improve drainage through the trabecular meshwork.\nSurgical trabeculectomy is an option for patients whose open-angle glaucoma has not responded to eye drops or surgical trabeculectomy. In this procedure, a small channel is created between the front of the eye to the conjunctiva, allowing drainage to bypass the trabecular network.\nGuarded filtration procedure and partial-thickness procedures are surgical procedures aimed at reducing intraocular pressure by improving drainage from the eye.\n']"

['Osteoporosis'],"['Osteoporosis is a disorder of the skeleton in which the structure of the bones becomes porous. This can lead to the bones becoming weak, fragile and prone to painful fractures (breaks). It is a common bone disorder which can affect people of all ages. According to the National Institutes of Health, over 53 million people in the U.S. are affected by or are at high risk of osteoporosis developing due to having low bone mass.[1]', 'Bones are composed of protein, collagen and calcium. In healthy bones, these elements  combine to ensure that the bones have a strong structure. In people with osteoporosis, however, the density of the bones decreases. This causes the structure of the bones to weaken in a process which can worsen over time.', 'Changes to the bones which occur when a person is affected by osteoporosis include:[2]', '\nBone density decreases (loss of calcification)\nBones become porous and spongy\nGaps develop in the bone structure\nThe sturdiness, typical of healthy bones, is lost\nFractures may occur independently, or as a result of very minor knocks or falls\n']","['Osteoporosis can remain undetected for many years, as it does not usually cause noticeable symptoms.', 'For most people, the first sign of osteoporosis is the diagnosis of a painful bone fracture resulting from a minor injury, such as a trivial slip-and-fall accident (an outcome which would not be expected to occur in someone with healthy bones).', 'People with osteoporosis are also prone to stress fractures, where a break occurs during a prolonged bout of a normal activity, such as walking, with no direct causal injury.[3]', 'Other signs that a person might be affected by osteoporosis include:[4]', '\nPain in the spine and back; spinal fractures can cause long-term or chronic pain\nHyperkyphosis; a stooped posture, often characterised by a hunched back\nDiminishing height\n', 'When a fracture occurs, the break will be accompanied by intense pain at the site of the fracture, which radiates out and also affects the surrounding area.', 'Fractures most likely to occur due to osteoporosis affect specific areas of the body including:[5][6]', '\nFemoral neck (hip)\nTibiofemoral joint (knee)\nVertebrae (spine)\nLumbar region (the lower part of the spine, which joins the torso to the abdomen)\nThorax (chest)\n']","[""Bone density increases until a person reaches their early 20s. Generally speaking, from a person's mid-30s, bone density begins to decrease.[7] Osteoporosis is caused when their bone density decreases at a rate which compromises the structure of their bones, which in turn become brittle (easily broken) and spongy."", 'Why does bone density decrease over time?', 'All bones perform a constant process of remodelling throughout a person’s lifetime. This involves the older bone matter dissolving (a process called resorption) at the same time as new bone cells produce new bone matter (osteoid).', 'According to the International Osteoporosis Foundation, the principal reason that the bones weaken in people with osteoporosis is that the processes involved in remoddelling are occuring out of sync with one another. Old bone matter is dissolved at a significantly faster rate than new bone matter is produced, leading to gaps forming in the structure of the bones and an overall decrease in bone density.', 'Causes of osteoporosis in children', 'Osteoporosis in children is uncommon, because bones generally grow stronger throughout one’s childhood and young adulthood, and the loss of bone density usually begins in adulthood.', 'Likewise, hormonal changes and health problems linked to osteoporosis, predominantly tend to affect older adults. However, it is possible to be affected by osteoporosis at any age, and there are certain conditions which increase a child’s likelihood of experiencing the condition.', 'Primary osteoporosis in children', 'Certain genetic conditions which impede the development of healthy bones can cause osteoporosis in children. These include:', '\nOsteogenesis imperfecta (OI)\nOsteoporosis pseudoglioma syndrome\n', 'These conditions cause osteoporosis in children by inhibiting the development of healthy bones.', 'Idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis is a rare condition in which a previously healthy child or teenager develops osteoporosis.[8] If you are concerned that your child, or a child that you know, may be showing signs of osteoporosis, get a free symptom assessment with the Ada app.', 'Secondary osteoporosis in children', 'It is much more common for children, who are affected by osteoporosis, to contract the condition as a result of other medical conditions and/or the medications associated with their management, such as the steroid medications often prescribed for children with asthma, eczema and arthritis.', 'Conditions which increase the likelihood of developing osteoporosis in children include:[8]', ""\nProblems related to sex hormone production. Children who experience delayed puberty are at increased risk of experiencing problems with bone growth and maintenance.\nInflammatory conditions. Bone loss is linked to inflammatory diseases, and osteoporosis is therefore more likely to be experienced by those with conditions like childhood arthritis and Crohn's disease.\nGastrointestinal diseases. Conditions like coeliac disease impede the intake of nutrients, including those needed for the maintenance of healthy bones.\nEating disorders. Anorexia nervosa and bulimia impede nutritional intake and engender hormonal imbalance, which negatively impacts bone formation.\nConditions which compromise a child’s ability to be active. These include muscular dystrophy, spinal cord injury and cerebral palsy.\n""]","['Treatment for osteoporosis focuses on four main areas:', '\nHealing fractures\nEnsuring that one’s nutritional intake contains appropriate quantities of vitamin D and calcium, often by incorporating supplements into one’s diet\nTaking medication to strengthen one’s bones\nPreventing future falls and fractures\n', 'Healing fractures', 'Osteoporosis does not cause broken bones to heal any more slowly than they otherwise would. Broken bones take between six and eight weeks to heal on average, but some fractures may require additional intervention.[26]', 'Fractures which commonly occur as a result of osteoporosis and which may require additional intervention include:', '\nHip fractures; a hip replacement is often needed\nWrist fracture; an operation is often needed\nSpinal fracture; surgery and/or physiotherapy may be needed to correct the alignment of the spine\n', 'Vitamin supplements', 'Lacking sufficient levels of calcium and vitamin D is a primary risk factor for developing osteoporosis. The body cannot make calcium on its own, and the production of sufficient levels of vitamin D (which the body needs in order to absorb calcium from food) requires exposure to plenty of sun. It is vital that one’s diet contains sufficient sources of both nutrients. People with osteoporosis are often advised to take supplements of both vitamin D and calcium in order to replenish the body’s levels of these substances and prevent further bone damage.', 'One’s doctor will advise on the appropriate brands and strengths of supplements to take, depending on factors including one’s age, weight, gender and the severity of one’s condition.', 'Medication for osteoporosis', 'There are many different types and brands of medication for osteoporosis. The kind of medication, which is recommended for an individual, will be selected based on factors including:[27]', '\nAge\nGender\nHormonal levels\nAbility to adhere to a given dosing schedule\nPreference\nConvenience\nCost\n', 'Bisphosphonates (oral medications)', 'The most commonly prescribed type of medications for osteoporosis are bisphosphonates. These are oral medications which work to maintain one’s bone density and delay the process of the bones breaking down. However, bisphosphonates may not be suitable in all cases of osteoporosis, as they can carry side effects of severe stomach upsets and heartburn (which can be lessened in most cases by taking the medication according to precise guidelines).', 'Injected medications', 'People who cannot tolerate oral bisphosphonates due to digestive complications and/or the extent to which their health is compromised by osteoporosis and other possible coexisting conditions may be prescribed injected medications.', 'Commonly prescribed injected medications include:[28][29]', '\nDenosumab (Prolia / Xgeva). This is a new medication suitable for both genders, which is unrelated to bisphosphonates and may be a viable alternative for people who are intolerant to them. It is also used in the treatment of bone cancer.\nTeriparatide (Forteo). This medication has the potential to rebuild bone and is most often prescribed for men and postmenopausal women with very low bone density.\nAbaloparatide (Tymlos). This medication can help new bone structure to form and redress the damage related to fractures from osteoporosis. It is the first medication to promote the formation of new bone structure, which is similar to that of pre-existing bone.\n', 'Both Teriparatide and Abaloparatide are recommended for a maximum of two years of use, during which time one receives daily injections.[30] Injected medications are most likely to be prescribed to treat:', '\nPeople with extremely low bone density\nChildren with osteoporosis\nPeople with multiple fractures\nOsteoporosis caused by steroid medication\n', 'Hormone replacement therapy (HRT)', 'Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) can slow the process of bone remodelling and help increase a woman’s bone mineral density, and can be prescribed for both early and late menopausal women to combat the negative effects of the decrease in estrogen levels that accompany the menopause. It involves regular supplements of estrogens and also progestins in some cases.[31]', 'HRT is not usually recommended as a long-term or first-line treatment for osteoporosis, because it is associated with severe side effects and health complications:[31]', '\nCardiovascular complications (problems relating to the heart including unstable angina or heart attacks, strokes and pulmonary embolism)\nBreast cancer\nEndometrial cancer\nOvarian cancer\nBreast tenderness\nVaginal bleeding\n', 'Women are usually only prescribed HRT for osteoporosis if all other possible treatments are unsuitable for an individual. When HRT is prescribed for osteoporosis, it should be at the lowest possible dose and for the shortest possible duration.', 'Preventing falls and fractures', 'Recent research on osteoporosis and fractures in the elderly suggests that preventing falls is just as important to managing osteoporosis as monitoring and improving one’s bone mineral density.[32]', 'Doctors are therefore advised to assess people with osteoporosis in order to ascertain the likelihood of falls which could result in fractures. They will use this information to devise preventative measures, suggesting changes to a person’s diet, daily routine and medications as necessary to avert the possibility of future falls.', 'Factors which one’s doctor may consider in assessing one’s risk of falling and preventative measures include:[32]', '\nOne’s history of falling, including the total number of falls in the previous 12 months\nLocation of falls\nAbility to get up independently after falling\nEyesight\nCognitive function\nOther relevant medical conditions\nWalking and movement\nMuscle strength and function\nMedications which may make dizziness, falling or loss of balance more likely\n', 'Changes to one’s home environment and routine which may help prevent falls include:', '\nTaking regular exercise; even in very elderly people, increased safe physical activity has been shown to reduce the likelihood of falls significantly, in part by improving strength and balance control\nRemoving trip hazards like trailing wires\nHaving regular hearing and eyesight tests\nPlacing non-stick mats on areas which are likely to become slippery, such as the kitchen floor and bathroom\nEating a healthy diet\n', 'Pain management', 'Bone fractures resulting from osteoporosis may be more painful than regular fractures due to the splintering of the bone that results from their weakened structure. People with osteoporosis will therefore be prescribed appropriate pain medication in order to manage the pain that results from both specific fractures, and from the generalised pain which often occurs in the spinal area.', 'Painkilling medications prescribed and/or recommended in the management of osteoporosis may include:', '\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS)\nPrescription anti-inflammatory medications\nNerve blocks\nOpiate painkillers\n', 'Ensuring that a person with osteoporosis is able to enact their day-to-day regime as comfortably as possible may require further medical interventions.', 'These may include:[33]', '\nPhysiotherapy\nEducational measures (to equip an individual to understand their needs and make the best choices to prevent pain)\nSurgical interventions (such as nerve removal)\n']"

Sometimes the whole outer ear may become red and swollen. In severe cases, people may develop headaches and fever.']",,"['Treatment may involve gentle cleaning of the ear, pain relief and antibiotic therapy. Pain-relieving medications such as ibuprofen or paracetamol are useful to help with pain. A doctor may prescribe antibiotics or anti-fungal medications to treat the infect, and these are most commonly an ointment or drops which are put into the ear.

This may be because symptoms of ovarian cancer are not always obvious, leading to late diagnosis. The prognosis (outlook) tends to be better, the earlier the cancer is detected.[1][4][5]', 'This type of cancer mostly affects women over the age of 50, and the average age at diagnosis is 63.[2][3] Every year, more than 20 000 women in the United States are diagnosed with ovarian cancer; in Europe this number is closer to 65 000.[1][4]', 'Treatment depends on the type of ovarian cancer and stage of diagnosis, but typically involves a combination of surgery and chemotherapy.[1][6][7] Recovery rates tend to be better in cases where the cancer is diagnosed early, and where the woman is younger than 40.[1][5]']","['Early signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer may be vague and similar to those found in many gastrointestinal conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

This is called neoadjuvant chemotherapy.[29]', 'Chemotherapy for ovarian cancer', 'Chemotherapy can improve the likelihood of recovery from ovarian cancer. It typically involves the administering of drugs called paclitaxel and carboplatin through the veins, a procedure that is done approximately once every three weeks for up to six cycles. Sometimes, other drugs may be used. The treatment may also be administered directly into the abdominal cavity; this is called intraperitoneal chemotherapy.[1][3]', 'The general aims of chemotherapy treatment are to destroy any remaining tumor tissue and increase the likelihood of recovery.[3]', 'Chemotherapy can sometimes have unpleasant side-effects, such as hair loss, nausea and vomiting, fatigue and pain. A doctor will be able to advise on how best to manage the side-effects, should they occur.[3][29] For more information, see this resource on chemotherapy side-effects.', 'Radiation therapy', 'Also known as radiotherapy, this type of treatment uses X-rays to destroy cancer cells. In the treatment of ovarian cancer, radiation therapy is typically only used in cases where a person does not respond to chemotherapy, or where the cancer is very advanced, and it is no longer possible to administer chemotherapy.[29]', 'Alternative treatments', 'While a number of other treatments for ovarian cancer are being explored, further research is needed before they can be recommended.[1] If a person is interested in alternatives to chemotherapy, it is advisable to consult with their healthcare team.', 'In some cases, it may be possible to participate in a clinical drug trial.

In recent trials, an ovarian cancer injection treatment showed promising results in a very small group of women with advanced ovarian cancer. The ovarian cancer vaccine was personalized for each participant.[19][20]', 'Q: Can taking aspirin help to prevent ovarian cancer?\nA: Initial research suggests that daily use of aspirin could lower the risk of ovarian cancer. However, further research is needed to confirm this. Because aspirin can cause serious side-effects, including stomach bleeding and hemorrhagic stroke, it should not be taken regularly unless recommended by one’s doctor.[21]', 'Q: Do any foods help to prevent ovarian cancer?\nA: While many internet sources suggest that certain foods may help to prevent ovarian cancer, there is no specific ovarian cancer prevention diet. A healthy, balanced diet that includes significant quantities of vegetables, fruits and whole grains is recommended by medical professionals. In addition, it is thought that avoiding processed meats and limiting one’s intake of red meat may be beneficial. Alcohol consumption should also be limited.[22][12]', 'Q: Will a cervical screening test detect ovarian cancer?\nA: No, except in a small number of very advanced cases, where a doctor might see the effects of ovarian cancer while performing the cervical examination.[23] According to Ovarian Cancer Action UK, one in four women mistakenly believe that ovarian cancer can be detected by cervical screening, also known as a cervical smear test or Pap test; a procedure which detects abnormal, potentially precancerous cells in the cervix, the part connecting the womb to the vagina. Detecting, and, if necessary, removing these cells and affected adjacent cervical tissue can reduce a person’s risk of developing cervical cancer, but the procedure does not collect information about the existence of cancerous or precancerous cells in areas other than the cervix. In all cases where ovarian cancer is suspected or a person is considered to be at high risk of developing ovarian cancer, including people with a family history of the condition, specialized screening for ovarian cancer is recommended.', 'Q: How can a gynecological check-up help prevent ovarian cancer?\nA: Going for a regular gynecological check-up can help to identify and address risk factors for ovarian cancer and other conditions of the female reproductive system, as well as increase the likelihood of detecting ovarian cancer at an earlier stage, thereby improving the outlook. It is recommended that all adult women see a gynecologist at least once a year, or whenever they are experiencing symptoms that they suspect are related to their reproductive system. Depending on a particular person’s medical history, needs and risk factors, a doctor may recommend that they go for more frequent check-ups.[24] If a person is concerned about any symptoms, they can also try using the Ada app for a free assessment.', 'Q: Can an intrauterine device (IUD) prevent ovarian cancer?\nA: It is not entirely clear whether an intrauterine contraceptive device, a form of long-acting reversible birth control inserted into the uterus to prevent pregnancy, could slightly increase, slightly decrease, or have no effect on a person’s risk of developing ovarian cancer. The results of studies so far have been conflicting, and further research is needed.[10][25][26][27] For those considering an intrauterine device, the risks versus benefits for a particular person can be assessed by, and should be discussed individually with, a doctor.', '', '\n\nPatient. “Ovarian Cancer.” December 2, 2016.

['Ovarian Cancer Screening'],"['Current ovarian cancer screening guidelines in the US, UK and many other countries suggest that only women whose personal or family medical history indicates a high risk should undergo screening tests. Generally speaking, for a person to be considered at high risk of ovarian cancer, they, or more than one close relative, must have had ovarian or breast cancer or certain other types of cancer, including pancreatic, colon, prostate or male breast cancer.[1][8][9]', 'If a woman’s family medical history indicates an elevated risk of ovarian cancer, they may be referred to a specialist for genetic screening as a first step. If these tests show that the woman has a gene mutation (abnormality) associated with ovarian cancer, or the woman chooses not to have these tests done, they may be referred for ovarian cancer screening and provided with advice on ovarian cancer prevention.[8]', 'If a woman has any concerns about their ovarian cancer risk, or thinks that they may have symptoms of ovarian cancer, it is recommended that they consult a doctor without delay.', 'Genetic testing', 'Genetic screening, which comprises testing and counseling, is performed to provide greater insight regarding a particular woman’s risk of developing ovarian cancer. It is also sometimes recommended for women who have already been diagnosed with ovarian cancer[1] to increase awareness of the possible risk of ovarian cancer and other types of cancer in family members.[10]', 'A genetic test will generally be able to identify whether a woman has any gene mutations that are known to be associated with ovarian cancer.[1] These include:[10]', '\nBreast cancer genes 1 and 2; BRCA1 and BRCA2\nGene mutations associated with Lynch syndrome, also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC)\n', 'Good to know: BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations seem to be particularly prevalent among Eastern European females and those of Ashkenazi Jewish descent.', 'Depending on the results of the genetic screening and the person’s age, circumstances and preferences, they may be referred for regular blood tests and pelvic examinations as part of ovarian cancer screening, and/or preventive interventions.[1][8]', 'While genetic testing can offer helpful insights into a woman’s risk of developing ovarian cancer, the tests – and results – are limited, in terms of their ability to conclusively confirm or rule out the possibility of ovarian cancer. Not all mutations can be detected with current technology. Furthermore, many people with genetic mutations will not develop ovarian cancer, while other people without genetic mutations might.[9]', 'Nevertheless, the reliability of testing methods for ovarian cancer is continually being improved with new research, and it is recommended that all females at high risk of ovarian cancer undergo screening to maximize the likelihood of early detection and effective treatment.']",,,
['Oxytocin'],"['Oxytocin is a hormone produced by the hypothalamus, a small, central part of the brain that functions as a gland, and released into the bloodstream by the posterior pituitary gland, a pea-sized gland located at the base of the brain that plays an important role in regulating the body and general wellbeing.[1]', 'Oxytocin acts as both a hormone and a neurotransmitter. It has a range of biological and cognitive functions and is believed to play a role in pregnancy, childbirth, sexual activity, maternal bonding, social bonding and stress. Its various prosocial functions have led to oxytocin being dubbed the love or cuddle hormone.[2]', 'Oxytocin is produced naturally by the body, usually upon physical contact with others. Supplements of the hormone are available, though they may lead to side-effects.', 'How is oxytocin produced and controlled?', 'Oxytocin is produced by the hypothalamus portion of the brain and is controlled by a positive feedback mechanism. The production of oxytocin is caused by a trigger or action which then stimulates further production. For example, contractions during childbirth trigger oxytocin production, which in turn triggers more contractions, which again triggers further production of oxytocin. This process is usually self-limiting, meaning it halts when the trigger or action ceases.[3]', 'If you think that you or a loved one may be experincning orpblems related to hormone production, you can get a free symotom assessment at any time by downloading the Ada app.']",,,

This condition tends to affect older adults and people who have other medical conditions, especially pancreas conditions. Symptoms are unspecific and often occur late, which complicates diagnosis and worsens the outlook after diagnosis. It may lead to unexplained weight loss, loss of appetite, chronic back pain and pain in the upper abdomen. Diagnosis is made by MRI or CT scans. Treatment involves surgery, chemotherapy and, sometimes, radiotherapy. People who are diagnosed in the early stages have a better chance of successful treatment, but this is not common.']","['There are often no symptoms in the early stages of pancreatic cancer. The most common symptoms of pancreas cancer include abdominal pain which spreads to the back, unexplained weight loss and yellowing of the skin and eyes.

Rarer symptoms include blood sugar problems and recurrent blood clots in the veins.']",,"['Treatment depends on the size, specific type of cancer and whether the cancer has a spread at the time of diagnosis. These factors are used to determine the stage of the cancer. The treatment involves surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or most commonly, a combination of these.

People who have pancreatic cancer which cannot be cured may receive treatments which aim to improve their symptoms and quality of life.']"
['Parkinson’s Disease'],"[""Parkinson or Parkinson's disease is a progressive condition which affects the parts of the brain responsible for controlling movement and coordination. This condition causes these areas to be slowly destroyed. Parkinson disease is one of the most common neurological disorders, though the exact cause is not known. People older than 60 years of age are most commonly affected. The typical symptoms are a shaking tremor, stiff muscles and slowed movements. A diagnosis of Parkinson disease can be made based on the symptoms and physical examination, though some follow-up tests are usually done to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment helps to reduce symptoms and maintain quality of life. Parkinson disease will slowly get worse over time, and in some cases, can cause severe movement problems and dementia.""]","['The most common symptoms of Parkinson disease are a shaking tremor of the hands or other parts, stiff muscles and a slowing of movements. Later symptoms may include problems with balance and walking, a reduction in facial expression, a low mood, memory loss, and difficulty sleeping.']",,"['Treatment aims to control symptoms and remain active.  Physiotherapy and occupational therapy are very helpful in helping people with this condition stay active and strong for as long as possible. There are several types of medication used to manage Parkinson disease, and work to reduce the tremor and muscle stiffness and make movements more fluid. Some people find that a technique called deep brain stimulation, where small electric nodes are placed in the brain to help control brain activity, causes a reduction in their symptoms.        Emotional support is important for people who have received a diagnosis of Parkinson disease, and individual counseling or joining a support group may be helpful.']"
['Pediatric Acute Otitis Media'],"['Acute otitis media is an infection of the middle ear. When children have this condition, it is known as pediatric (or childhood) otitis media. This is a very common childhood condition, especially in children younger than 5 years of age. The middle ear is the part of the ear inside the ear drum, and helps conduct sound through the ear. An infection can be caused by viruses or bacteria. Typical signs may include pain of the ear, fever, hearing difficulty and difficulty sleeping. Infants may cry more than usual or pull on their ear. Treatment is pain relief and sometimes requires antibiotics. Most children do not develop any complications and recover well from a middle ear infection.']","['Typical symptoms of this conditions are pain of the ear and difficulty hearing.

['Pericardial Effusion'],"['Pericardial effusion is a buildup of fluid around the heart muscle. The heart is surrounded by a protective membrane called the pericardium, which is a sac comprised of two layers of tissue with lubricating fluid in between. Pericardial effusion occurs when the amount of fluid between the two pericardium (sac) layers is abnormally high.[1][2][3]', 'Good to know: Effusion is the medical term for a buildup of fluid. Effusions can occur in other parts of the body besides the heart membrane. For example, fluid can build up around the lungs – this is called pleural effusion.', 'Often, pericardial effusion is mild, progresses slowly, does not cause any signs or symptoms, and is discovered incidentally as part of a routine medical check-up. However, if the pericardial effusion develops or progresses rapidly, the pressure it exerts may compromise the functioning of the heart and lead to serious complications – particularly where there is a large amount of fluid.', 'Signs of pericardial effusion may include:', '\nChest pain\nRapid heartbeat\nFeeling lightheaded\nFainting\n', 'See the symptoms section below for more.[1][2][3]', 'Pericardial effusion can be caused by almost any disease or health condition that affects the pericardium, including pericarditis (inflammation of the pericardium), infections and systemic disorders, for example, hypothyroidism, systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, as well as kidney failure and cancer.[1][4]', 'While pericardial effusion can affect people of all ages, the incidence seems to be higher in those over 50.[5] Generally speaking, in younger people the heart is better able to compensate for a progressing effusion.[2]', 'The prognosis for pericardial effusion depends on the size of the effusion and the underlying cause. Small effusions are quite common and may simply require monitoring by a doctor, often resolving on their own with supportive treatment.[1] Where necessary, treatment for pericardial effusion involves addressing the cause, for example by prescribing antibiotics for a bacterial infection, steroids and other medications for rheumatoid arthritis, or anti-inflammatory medications for pericarditis.[1][6] Large effusions typically indicate a more serious health condition and may require drainage (pericardiocentesis).[1][7] Recovery may take several weeks or months, depending on the severity and cause of the pericardial effusion.[6]', 'A possible complication of pericardial effusion is cardiac tamponade, which is a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention.[1]']","['Signs and symptoms depend on the size of the heart effusion and the rate at which it develops.

Colchicine may improve the prognosis and help prevent pericarditis recurring. If the pericarditis does not respond to treatment, a course of corticosteroids, such as prednisone, may be necessary.[13][14][15] In cases of acute pericarditis caused by myocardial infarction (heart attack), however, corticosteroids cannot be used, as they may negatively affect the healing process.[16]', 'Pericardiocentesis', 'Large effusions that persist or are at risk of causing cardiac tamponade may be treated with pericardiocentesis. In this procedure, excess fluid is drained from the pericardium using a needle and catheter (thin tube). The doctor will typically rely on echocardiography (ultrasound) to guide the process.[1][4][8][12]', 'Pericardiostomy', 'Where the pericardial effusion is very large and repeated pericardiocentesis has not been effective, surgery may be recommended. The following procedures may be used:', 'Subxiphoid pericardiostomy: Also called a “pericardial window”, this procedure can be performed under local anesthesia and has a high success rate. The doctor will make an incision under the breastbone and remove a small part of the pericardium to drain the excess fluid.[1][8]', 'Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery: This is also known as VATS or thoracoscopy. Although the procedure involves general anesthesia, it is minimally invasive – requiring only small incisions in the chest wall. The doctor will use a tiny camera to view the pericardium and make a more accurate diagnosis, and can then drain excess fluid by creating a small hole in the pericardium (pleuropericardial window).[17][18]', 'Alternatives to surgery', 'Where surgery is not recommended, the following interventions may be used:', 'Percutaneous balloon pericardiotomy: During this procedure, a doctor inserts a needle into the pericardium via the chest wall. The needle is then replaced with a catheter, which has an inflatable balloon at the tip. This balloon is inflated to create a small hole in the pericardium through which excess fluid can be drained. Balloon pericardiotomy is predominantly used for repeated pericardial effusion that is caused by cancer.[1][8][19]', 'Intrapericardial sclerosis: In this procedure, a medication is administered to the pericardium to treat the effusion. Medications used include the antibiotics tetracycline and doxycycline and the chemotherapy drug cisplatin, among others.[1]', 'Complications of pericardial effusion', 'Cardiac tamponade', 'This is a life-threatening condition that may develop from pericardial effusion.

However, because pericardial effusion may lead to cardiac tamponade, going for regular check-ups and ensuring careful management of heart health is critical. The doctor may recommend pericardiocentesis to drain the cardiac effusion as a preventative measure.[6] In many cases, however, pericardiocentesis alone may prove inadequate, and a pericardiectomy may also be necessary.[2]', 'Small pericardial effusions that persist for a long period of time are fairly common, and are not as much of a concern as large effusions.']"
['Pericardiectomy (Surgery on the Heart Membrane)'],"['A pericardiectomy is a surgical procedure in which all or part of the pericardium is removed. The pericardium is the membrane around the heart; a sac comprised of two thin layers of tissue with lubricating fluid in between.

['Pericarditis (Inflammation of the Heart Membrane)'],"['Pericarditis is a term for inflammation of the pericardium – the membrane around the heart. The pericardium, which keeps the heart in place and prevents friction from surrounding organs, is a sac comprised of two layers of tissue with lubricating fluid in between. When pericarditis occurs, this tissue becomes inflamed and may rub against the heart, causing chest pain that is sometimes mistaken for a heart attack.[1][2][3]', 'Pericarditis is a relatively common heart condition – it is estimated to be the cause of five percent of visits to hospital emergency rooms for chest pain. It can affect people of all ages, but is most common in men between 20 and 50 years old.[1][4][5]', 'In most cases, the cause of pericarditis is unknown. Viral infections are a common trigger, but the cause may also be another type of infection, a chest injury, heart attack or heart surgery, another medical condition, or certain medicines – such as penicillin and some chemotherapy drugs. Pericarditis may develop suddenly and be short-lived (acute), or develop over time and be a chronic condition.[3][4][6]', 'Most cases of acute pericarditis are mild and clear up on their own within a few days to a number of weeks with rest and medication to reduce the inflammation. However, roughly 20 to 50 percent of people treated for acute pericarditis may go on to develop recurrent pericarditis, which requires long-term treatment. Though uncommon in pericarditis, life-threatening complications like cardiac tamponade and constrictive pericarditis may occur and necessitate immediate intervention. In all cases, the prognosis depends largely on the cause of the pericarditis.[1][2][4][5]']","['Main symptoms of pericarditis:[7][8]', 'The most common symptom of pericarditis is chest pain. This may develop suddenly and be experienced as a sharp, stabbing sensation behind the breastbone on the left side of the body. However, for some people there may be a constant, steady pain, or more of a dull ache or feeling of pressure.', 'The chest pain may radiate into the left shoulder and neck, and tends to be worse when breathing deeply, coughing, swallowing or lying down. Sitting up or leaning forward may ease the pain.', 'Other symptoms of pericarditis:', 'Individuals experiencing pericarditis may also present with:[5][7][8][9]', '\nFever\nFatigue or weakness\nShortness of breath (particularly if cardiac tamponade develops)\nDifficulty breathing or rapid breathing\nRapid heartbeat\nPalpitations (the feeling that the heart is skipping a beat or pounding)\nNausea\nChills\nCough\nSwelling of the legs or abdomen\nLow blood pressure (in severe cases)\n', 'If any symptoms are present and pericarditis is suspected, medical advice should be sought immediately.']","['Viruses are the most common cause of acute pericarditis. A number of different viruses are associated with the heart condition, including, among others:[5][7][^10]', '\nCoxsackieviruses\nEchoviruses\nAdenoviruses (e.g. the common cold, pneumonia)\nHIV\nInfluenza\nHepatitis viruses\n', 'Other causes of pericarditis include:[3][5][7][^10]', '\nBacterial infection (usually spread from nearby tissues, or wounds after heart surgery)\nTuberculosis\nFungi and parasites\nKidney failure\nHeart attack or heart surgery\nChest injury (e.g. a stab wound or car accident)\nRadiotherapy to treat cancers in the chest\nCancer that has spread from another part of the body (rare)\nAutoimmune conditions (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus)\nInflammatory bowel disease (e.g. ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease)\nCertain medications (e.g. penicillin, phenytoin, warfarin and rifampin)\n', 'In many cases, no cause can be identified and the condition is termed idiopathic pericarditis.', 'The cause of recurrent pericarditis is unknown, though it is thought that irregularities in the immune system may play a role. Pericarditis may result from autoimmune conditions like systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma, where the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue or cells.[1]']","['Treatment depends on the severity and type of the pericarditis. The goals are to relieve pain and reduce inflammation, address the underlying cause where possible, and detect and manage possible complications.[12]', 'Acute pericarditis', 'A doctor will assess whether the affected person can safely be treated at home, or whether they need to be admitted to hospital. People who present with a high fever, signs of cardiac tamponade or serious pericardial effusion, or who have recently been treated with blood thinners are likely to be admitted to hospital as they have an increased risk of complications. In addition, if outpatient treatment is not successful, hospital admission will typically be required.[3][13]', 'Where hospitalization is unnecessary, a doctor may advise the affected person to rest at home and prescribe anti-inflammatory medication, such as aspirin or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) like ibuprofen to reduce pain and inflammation.[7][12][13]', 'If the pain is severe or the symptoms do not improve within two weeks, colchicine – a medication that reduces inflammation – may be prescribed. Colchicine improves the outlook of pericarditis and reduces the likelihood of it recurring. If the pericarditis does not respond to this treatment, a course of corticosteroids (like prednisone) may be recommended. Because the risk of recurrent pericarditis may increase when steroids are used, they tend to be prescribed with caution. In cases of acute pericarditis caused by myocardial infarction (heart attack), corticosteroids cannot be used, as they may negatively affect the healing process. If the cause of pericarditis is bacterial, antibiotics may be prescribed.[3][5][7][12][13]', 'Recurrent pericarditis', 'Repeat episodes of pericarditis are typically managed in the same way as acute pericarditis, with anti-inflammatory medication prescribed to relieve pain and reduce inflammation. A long-term course of colchicine may help prevent a relapse of symptoms. Corticosteroids are usually used as a last resort.', 'Recurrent pericarditis, also known as relapsing pericarditis, may be incessant – where there is a relapse within six weeks of stopping treatment (this may be a continuation of the first episode of pericarditis), or intermittent – where more than six weeks pass between relapses (a true recurrence). The condition may be debilitating.[3][13][14][15]', 'Where recurrent pericarditis is severe and unresponsive to treatment, surgery may be recommended. The procedure is called a pericardiectomy and involves the removal of a part or most of the pericardium.[3][14]', 'Constrictive pericarditis', 'This is a rare but serious potential complication of pericarditis. It develops when the pericardium is inflamed for a long period of time, and subsequently thickens and contracts around the heart – compromising its functioning. Symptoms of constrictive pericarditis may include swelling of the legs, ankles and other parts of the body, tiredness and shortness of breath.[3][7]', 'Constrictive pericarditis may be transient or chronic. Where the condition is chronic, a pericardiectomy is typically the only effective treatment. If constrictive pericarditis is suspected, medical advice should be sought immediately.[14][16]', 'Chronic effusive pericarditis', 'This condition involves fluid accumulating slowly between the two layers of the pericardium without necessarily leading to cardiac tamponade. Symptoms may include chest pain, lightheadedness and shortness of breath.[14][17][18]', 'Large, persistent pericardial effusions may be drained, or the condition may be treated with one of the following interventions:[5]', '\nBalloon pericardiotomy – where a balloon-tipped catheter (thin tube) is used to create a hole in the pericardium to drain the fluid.[19]\nSurgical pericardial window – where a small part of the pericardium is opened to drain the fluid. Also known as a subxiphoid pericardiostomy.[20]\nSclerosis of the pericardial sac with tetracycline or other substances – administration of a substance to stiffen the tissue, so that the two layers can stick together. Doing this can help prevent a build-up of fluid.[21]\n', 'Cardiac tamponade', 'This is a rare but life-threatening possible complication of pericarditis, where fluid builds up in the pericardium and exerts pressure on the heart, compromising its ability to function. Cardiac tamponade seems to be more common in cases of pericarditis caused by tuberculosis or cancer. Symptoms may develop suddenly (within minutes or hours) and can include:', '\nWeakness\nFaintness\nFatigue\nNausea\nSevere shortness of breath\nPalpitations (the feeling that the heart is skipping a beat or pounding)\nConfusion\nLow blood pressure with blurred vision and fainting\nLoss of consciousness\n', 'Emergency treatment is essential and typically involves a procedure called pericardiocentesis, where excess fluid in the pericardium is removed via the chest wall using a needle or tube.[3][14][17][16]', 'Pericarditis FAQs', 'Q: What is effusive-constrictive pericarditis?\nA: Effusive-constrictive pericarditis is a serious condition in which constrictive pericarditis is present together with pericardial effusion (often with cardiac tamponade). It seems to be more prevalent in cases of pericarditis caused by tuberculosis. Treatment may include pericardiocentesis to relieve pressure on the heart muscle, anti-inflammatory medications, corticosteroids, and – in some cases – pericardiectomy.[14][22][23]', 'Q: Can pericarditis be prevented?\nA: It is not usually possible to prevent pericarditis. However, steps can be taken to reduce the likelihood of experiencing a repeat episode of pericarditis, chronic pericarditis, or complications from pericarditis. These steps include:[12]', '\nSeeking treatment without delay\nFollowing the treatment plan (for example, taking colchicine as prescribed)\nListening to a doctor’s advice for ongoing medical care\n', 'Other names for pericarditis', '\nIdiopathic pericarditis\nAcute pericarditis\nRecurrent pericarditis\nChronic pericarditis\n', '', '\n\nAmerican Heart Association. “What is Pericarditis?” July 5, 2016.

['Peripheral Vascular Disease'],"['Peripheral vascular disease (PVD), also known as peripheral arterial disease, is a common condition in which there is a slow narrowing and hardening of the blood vessels in the legs. This causes poor blood flow and a lack of oxygen to the feet and legs. Smokers are mainly affected. Other risk factors are diabetes, high blood cholesterol and high blood pressure. Typical symptoms are pain, numbness, paleness, burning and heaviness of the legs. The diagnosis can often be made based on the symptoms and physical exam in a person who has risk factors for developing this condition. Treatment involves some lifestyle changes, getting good control of other medical conditions, and, if symptoms are severe, surgery. If this condition is not actively managed, the on-going lack of oxygen can cause the tissues in the feet and leg to die, and in the worse case, this may require amputation.']","['Common symptoms include pain, paleness, burning and heaviness of the legs or feet. These may start mild and worsen over the time.  Many people also experience a painful aching in the leg muscles while exercising which gets better with rest.

Erectile dysfunction may also be a symptom of this condition in men.']",,"['Treatment of peripheral vascular disease involves lifestyle changes, treating any other medical conditions and, sometimes, surgery. Giving up smoking, eating a balanced diet and taking regular exercise can help to stop the peripheral vascular disease from getting worse.

['Plantar Warts'],"['Plantar warts, sometimes called verrucas, are a type of wart found on the sole of the foot or the toes, most commonly in weight-bearing locations such as the heel. They are a very common type of wart, especially in children, and are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV) – a common viral infection of the skin. HPV infections in locations other than the foot are not classed as plantar warts.', 'HPV is contagious, meaning plantar warts can be passed from person to person, either through direct skin-to-skin contact or indirectly through contact with a surface or object that carries the virus.

If they prove resistant, however, doctors can recommend further treatment methods.[7]', 'Plantar warts removal methods include:', 'Salicylic acid: This is a strong acid, generally applied as a gel, that gradually dissolves layers of skin from the affected area, eventually resulting in complete removal of the wart. Though it is available over the counter, prescription varieties tend to be stronger and more effective. As well as peeling away the surface of the warts, salicylic acid may also stimulate the immune system to fight the virus.', 'Cryotherapy: In cryotherapy, a doctor freezes the warts by applying liquid nitrogen. The process results in a blister forming around the wart that can, after around a week, be removed. Repeated sessions may be necessary.', 'The use of salicylic acid and cryotherapy are the most common treatment methods. If these are ineffective, however, others are available.', 'Trichloroacetic acid: This is another strong acid applied by a doctor after the surface of the wart has been shaved off.', 'Immunotherapy: This treatment method involves injecting the warts with antigens that stimulate the immune system into fighting the HPV infection.

Covering the wart with a plaster may also help.[17]', 'Q: Are plantar warts contagious?\nA: Yes, the HPV that causes plantar warts is contagious. It can be passed from person to person, as well as indirectly through surfaces or objects. The virus particularly thrives in warm, moist environments, meaning it is commonly contracted in swimming pools or locker rooms.[18]', 'Q: Does duct tape really work to remove plantar warts?\nA: There is no clear evidence to suggest that the application of duct tape really works to remove plantar warts. However, the method is enduringly popular and does seem to work for some people, despite the science behind this being unclear. If you are considering using this method, consult a doctor beforehand.[10]', 'Q: Can plantar warts be cancerous?\nA: In the vast majority of cases, plantar warts are harmless and pose no risk of cancer. Certain types of the HPV virus, however, can lead to some cancers.

As it is more difficult to notice pneumonia symptoms in infants, parents should be vigilant if their child vomits, appears to feel ill, is limp, pale or restless or cries more than usual.', 'Bacterial pneumonia tends to be more serious, but is more common among older children.', 'Good to know: Parents should seek immediate medical attention promptly if their child’s breathing is distressed to the point that their nostrils flare when they breathe, they are breathing quickly, or they are visibly using the accessory muscles of the belly – above the collarbones or below the ribs – to breathe.[7]', 'Just as with adults, when a child’s immune system is compromised for reasons including recent hospitalization, asthma or chronic illness, they are at greater risk of contracting pneumonia.

People in hospitals or nursing homes are more likely to be exposed to microorganisms that can result in developing hospital acquired pneumonia, and many conditions that older people are more likely to have, such as diabetes, heart disease and lung disease, are linked to pneumonia – though it is unclear whether addressing these issues directly lessens a person’s chance of developing pneumonia.[8]', 'Good to know: Though pneumonia symptoms experienced by older people can be similar to those among people of all ages, some older people primarily experience symptoms of fatigue or confusion.']",,"['Antibiotics may be used to treat bacterial, mycoplasmal and some other types of pneumonia, and antifungal medications may be used for fungal pneumonia. Viral pneumonia cannot be treated with antibiotics, but it usually resolves on its own.[1]', 'Most people recover at home rather than at the hospital. The most common treatment for pneumonia involves supporting the body’s health and immune system, such as improving the affected person’s diet, fluid intake or rest. Other treatments may include lowering the fever or administering oxygen. A younger person might recover from pneumonia in a few days while taking antibiotics, while a person over 60 years of age or who has a chronic health condition might be hospitalized for monitoring and treatment.', 'Some people take over-the-counter-painkillers such as aspirin, acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil). Although some people use cough suppressants, some coughing is necessary to remove built-up fluid and mucus from the lungs and airways.']"
['Pneumothorax'],"['Pneumothorax is a condition in which there is air in the chest (the thorax) which is outside of the lungs. This air pushes on the lung which prevents it from being able to expand fully. Signs of this condition are sudden chest pain and often breathing problems. Sometimes a pneumothorax can occur without any particular cause, but it is most common after an injury to the chest. The symptoms often include shortness of breath and chest pain. A small pneumothorax may not need any particular treatment, but a larger pneumothorax may to have the air let out to help improve breathing. Although this condition can be life-threatening, most people recover well with treatment.']","['The most common symptoms of a pneumothorax are a sharp, one-sided chest pain and shortness of breath. The pain may be worse when taking a breath in. People with a small pneumothorax may only have mild symptoms.

['Podagra'],"['Podagra, which in Greek translates to ‘foot trap’, is gout which affects the joint located between the foot and the big toe, known as the metatarsophalangeal joint.', 'Gout, also known as gouty arthritis, results in recurrent, acute attacks of joint pain and inflammation. This is normally caused by hyperuricemia, chronically high levels of uric acid in the blood, which can cause small urate crystals to form in and around the joints. Gout tends to start in one joint, often that of the big toe, before spreading to others. Podagra is the first joint manifestation in about half of all cases of gout and is eventually seen in about 90 percent of cases.[1] If you think you may be experiencing signs of podagra and gout, see the Ada app for a free symptom assessment.', 'Certain foods, especially red meat or organ meats such as liver or kidneys, as well as oily fish, drinking alcohol, and conditions such as high blood pressure or obesity may lead to the production of higher than normal levels of urate - a salt of uric acid - in the body. Gout mainly affects people over 30 years old and tends to affect more men than women.']","['Podagra causes severe pain in the metatarsophalangeal joint, which is the joint at the base of the big toe. The onset of podagra is characterized by intense attacks of pain, usually sudden and often at night. It is not clear how, but even without treatment, the body normally resolves a gout flare on its own. Untreated attacks normally last about 5-10 days, though the pain is most severe in the first 12-24 hours, after which time it usually improves over a few days to several weeks.', 'The most common podagra flare symptoms result from inflammation localized in the metatarsophalangeal joint (big toe joint), including:[2][3]', '\nSevere pain\nSwelling\nRedness\nSensation of heat\nDifficulty moving the joint\n', 'Less common symptoms of a gout attack include:[2][3]', '\nTophi: uric acid crystal deposits appearing as firm, yellowish nodules on the joint\nFever\nFatigue\n', 'Without preventive measures, the average time between the first attack and a recurrence is about one year, though podagra may recur much sooner, or it may never happen again. Subsequent attacks of podagra may last longer than the initial one, and may lead to damage in the metatarsophalangeal joint, with difficulty walking becoming permanent in some cases. In cases of chronic gout, also known as chronic gouty arthritis, a person may experience symptoms of inflammation most or all of the time.', 'If you think you may be experiencing symptoms of podagra and gout, try the Ada app for a free symptom assessment.']","['Podagra is a manifestation of gout, in which uric acid crystallizes and settles in one or more joints. This is often caused either by excess amounts of uric acid being produced, or not enough being excreted from the urine on a chronic basis. Any abrupt increase in the level of uric acid in the blood may also trigger an attack of podagra or gout.', 'Most people with elevated blood levels of uric acid will never develop podagra and gout, and gout is not always associated with elevated uric acid blood levels; the condition can also occur despite there being normal levels of uric acid at the point in time when blood levels are measured.[4]', 'It is thought to develop due to an immune response. White blood cells and joint-lining cells may attempt to surround and digest urate crystal deposits. The chemical signals sent out by these cells contribute to the characteristic inflammation of podagra specifically and gout in general.', 'Uric acid crystals tend to settle in the big toe, as in the case of podagra. This joint is where there tends to be increased impact from walking and supporting the weight of the body. Uric acid crystals are also less soluble under acid conditions and in cooler temperatures, as occur in the big toe and other extremities, such as the hands and feet.[1][5] Attacks tend to happen at night and are thought to be made more likely by a lower body temperature.', 'Podagra risk factors', 'There are many medical conditions and lifestyle factors that may increase the risk of developing podagra, a special form of gout, including:[1][6]', '\nDiabetes\nObesity\nFasting or overeating protein rich foods\nHigh blood pressure\nTaking medications that alter urate blood levels, especially diuretics, such as for heart failure or high blood pressure\nKidney disease, especially chronic kidney disease\nBeing a man older than about 30\nBeing a woman who has experienced menopause\nRegularly drinking excessive amounts of alcohol, especially rum, whisky, vodka, gin and beer\nEating large amounts of red meat or organ meats, such as liver or kidneys, or certain oily fish such as anchovies or trout\nConsuming large amounts of fructose, such as in beverages containing high fructose corn syrup\n', 'Some rare medical conditions may increase the risk of developing gout in general and podagra as a special form of gout, such as conditions which result in:[6]', 'High cell turnover: This may be caused by certain autoimmune conditions, such as psoriasis, a scaly skin condition, or as a side effect of certain medications, such as with tumor lysis syndrome, in which large amounts of tumor cells are killed off (lysed) by treatment, releasing their contents into the bloodstream.', 'Enzyme defects: This may be caused by certain genetic disorders which cause disordered processing of uric acid , such as Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, also known as juvenile gout.', 'In people who have had a gout flare-up, there are factors that may increase the risk of recurrence, including:[6]', '\nInjury to the foot\nDrinking excessive amounts of alcohol.[7]\nFasting or overeating protein rich foods\nTaking medications that alter urate blood levels. These medicines are necessary for the management of other conditions, and should not be stopped or adjusted without a doctor’s supervision.\n']","['In the case of a first attack, or if a person experiences attacks less than twice a year without tophi and/or very high uric acid levels, treatment is usually limited to the duration of an attack by using medication to relieve pain and inflammation. A doctor may prescribe medication to keep on hand for use in the event of a future attack. Which medication and dose to use is determined based on a number of factors, includings kidney health, ulcer history and the person’s risk of bleeding. Possible medications include:[11]', '\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): NSAIDs such as e.g. ibuprofen are effective when used as early as possible in a podagra attack and when taken in higher doses to achieve anti-inflammatory, not just pain-relieving properties. A doctor will be able to recommend the appropriate type and dose. Aspirin should be avoided for podagra and gout, as it can raise or lower uric acid levels, potentially making the condition worse.\nColchicine: This may be prescribed in pill form for those who cannot tolerate NSAIDs. Colchicine seems to be most effective when started within the first 24 hours of an attack.\nGlucocorticoids: These may be given orally, by intra-articular (into the joint) injection, or occasionally by intravenous (IV) or intramuscular injection.\n', 'Good to know: It is recommended to rest the affected foot as much as possible by avoiding walking, or using a cane or splint to avoid putting weight on the foot. The swelling may also be brought down by elevating the foot and keeping it cool with an ice pack for 20 minutes at a time.', 'Chronic podagra treatment and uric acid-lowering medication', 'Podagra may become chronic, in which there are repeated episodes of pain and inflammation, which may also spread to multiple joints and lead to joint damage and disability. In cases of chronic podagra and gout, a uric acid-lowering regimen may be recommended to prevent or reverse the crystal deposits that lead to and worsen chronic gout.', 'Those with more than two gouty attacks per year, joint damage as seen on a radiograph, or tophi (uric acid crystals) may be given uric acid-lowering medication, such as allopurinol.', 'Good to know: Allopurinol should not be taken until the end of an acute attack, as acute drops in uric acid could prolong the attack.[8]', 'During the first six months of uric acid-lowering medication, medication to reduce inflammation may be provided. This is because uric acid-lowering medications change serum and tissue uric acid levels, and so may trigger acute attacks of podagra and gout. Medication to treat swelling and pain, as well as to lessen any damage caused by podagra attacks may include:[2]', 'NSAIDs are sometimes given for daily use, and have an advantage for people who also have osteoarthritis. This decreases swelling and potential joint damage.', 'Colchicine may be given at a low dose to prevent gastrointestinal side effects which may occur at higher doses of NSAID use. Colchicine works by decreasing swelling and lessening the buildup of uric acid crystals.', 'Lifestyle changes may also be helpful in the management of gout and podagra. These include:[4][12]', '\nLosing weight, if overweight: Can greatly reduce urate levels. Should be combined with regular exercise. Rapid weight loss should be avoided, as this can raise urate levels.\nDrinking plenty of water: Can reduce the risk of uric acid crystals forming in the joints. Sugary drinks should be avoided, as high levels of fructose are likely to increase blood urate levels.\nAvoiding excessive alcohol consumption: Beer and spirits are especially likely to increase urate levels.\nClose management of blood pressure and diabetes management if appropriate\nMaintaining a healthy diet: Foods rich in purines, chemical compounds made naturally by the body, but also found in high levels in certain foods, may worsen podagra and gout. Foods to be avoided include red meat, organ meats and certain oily fish, such as anchovies or mackerel. Plenty of vitamin C-rich fruit and vegetables should be eaten, as they help the kidneys to remove urate.\n', 'Podagra FAQs', 'Q: Why does gout target the big toe?\nA: Podagra is the first joint manifestation in about half of all cases of gout, and is eventually seen in about 90 percent of cases. Uric acid crystals tend to settle in the big toe, where there is normally increased stress from walking and supporting the weight of the body. Furthermore these crystals are also less soluble under acid conditions and at the cooler joints in the extremities, such as the big toe.', 'Q: What does a podagra attack feel like?\nA: Podagra typically comes on suddenly, often with a few hours and often at night, thought to be because this is when the body temperature lowers. The toe or foot becomes swollen, red, hot and can be very painful. Sometimes a person will also experience fever and fatigue.

This virus infects the nervous system and may lead to muscle weakness or paralysis (inability to move muscles at all). This condition is very uncommon as immunization has caused the virus to be eradicated from many countries. People who are not immunized against polio and who travel to areas where the poliovirus is still active have a risk of getting a polio infection. Children under 5 years of age are most commonly affected. Symptoms may include fever, sore throat, headaches and aching muscles. Some, but not all, people go on to develop muscle weakness.

['Polycystic Ovary Syndrome'],"['Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a condition that affects the normal functioning of a woman’s ovaries. The ovaries usually produce ova (eggs) and the hormones estrogen and progesterone. These hormones influence the menstrual cycle and the production and release of eggs from the ovaries. In healthy women, ovulation occurs every month. At this point, the eggs are released into the fallopian tubes. Before this, these eggs develop tiny cysts within, known as follicles.', 'Polycystic ovary syndrome is diagnosed if at least two of the following occur:[1]', '\nA minimum of 12 small cysts (follicles) form in the ovaries. These cysts are not big enough to trigger ovulation.\nThe balance of the hormones produced in the ovaries is altered, particularly if the amount of testosterone produced increases.\nThe individual does not ovulate each month or does not ovulate at all. In this case, the affected woman may not have a period.\n', 'In many cases, affected women will experience all three of these effects.', 'Although PCOS is a relatively common condition, occurring in approximately 5 to 10 percent of women, the exact cause is not known.[2] It is usually diagnosed during adolescence or in young adulthood, and symptoms include irregular or absent periods, excessive hair growth and difficulty falling pregnant.', 'PCOS is a chronic condition with no cure. After menopause, once ovarian function has declined, the symptoms of the condition will typically improve. Before this, treatment is aimed at managing the signs and symptoms and preventing complications.', 'Certain lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, are the most typical treatment methods for adolescent girls and women experiencing the condition. Medication is typically reserved for the occurrence of complaints, such as anovulation, hirsutism and menstrual irregularities.']","['Symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome include:[2][3]', '\nMenstrual irregularity: If ovulation does not occur, women will experience irregular or missed periods.\nWeight gain: Approximately half of all women with PCOS will experience weight gain that is difficult to manage.\nUnwanted hair growth: Also called hirsutism, affected areas may include the face, arms, chest and back.\nHair loss or thinning: Primarily experienced on the head, normally in middle aged women.\nDifficulty becoming pregnant: Some women may find it difficult to fall pregnant and may require fertility treatments.\nAcne: Unwanted acne may develop, as well as other skin disorders such as skin tags, darkened patches of skin, oily skin and excessive sweating.\nChangeable mood: Some women may experience mood swings, anxiety and/or depression.\nPelvic pain\nHeadaches\nDifficulty sleeping\nHigh blood pressure (hypertension)\nAcanthosis nigricans: Brown or grey, velvety and sometimes verrucous patches of hyperpigmented skin.

There are, however, a number of factors which are thought to play a role. These factors include:[1][4]', '\nInsulin production: Produced in the pancreas, insulin is a hormone with the key function of controlling blood sugar levels. In the ovaries, it also helps to produce the male sex hormone testosterone. Women with PCOS have an insulin resistance, meaning that their bodies are not affected by normal levels of insulin in the usual way. This causes their bodies to produce increased amounts of insulin, resulting in unusually elevated levels of testosterone being present in the ovaries. This testosterone interferes with the ability of the follicles in the ovaries to fully develop.\nLuteinising hormone (LH): Produced in the pituitary gland, luteinising hormone works to help the ovaries to ovulate and assists insulin in the production of testosterone. High levels of the hormone are found in roughly half of all women with PCOS.\nWeight: Although not a cause of PCOS in itself, being overweight can make insulin resistance worse by causing the the body to produce increased levels of insulin.\nGenetic factors: It is thought that there may be a hereditary element to PCOS, but the links between genetics and the development of the condition are not yet fully understood.\n']","['There is currently no cure for polycystic ovary syndrome.

Women who wish to lose weight should discuss the best ways of achieving this with their doctor.', 'Medications', 'Metformin, though not designed specifically for the treatment of PCOS, may be prescribed by doctors to help treat the condition. Metformin helps the body to become more sensitive to insulin, helping to equalize the balance of hormones in women with a hormone imbalance.[7] Metformin should only be used in cases where lifestyle changes fail to help manage the condition and then should be used in combination with lifestyle changes.', 'The first line of treatment for women who are infertile but wish to become pregnant is clomifene, a non-steroidal anti-oestrogen medication that helps to increase FSH secretion, which in turn may lead to follicular menstruation and ovulation. Letrozole, a medication not specifically designed to help with ovulation but which, as some research suggests, can be more effective than clomifene, may also be prescribed in some cases.[2]', 'In women who do not desire to become pregnant, oral contraceptives (OCs, with combined estrogen and progesterone) are commonly prescribed. OCs help to promote regular menstrual periods and can help to reduce excess hair growth and acne.[2]', 'A hormonal substrate named progestin may also be prescribed to help promote regular periods, though this method does not help with acne or hair growth and does not prevent pregnancy.[2]']"

The Streptococcus most commonly causes tonsillitis and skin infections. It is thought that this causes glomerulonephritis because the immune system mistakes the kidney cells for the Streptococcal bacteria. This condition is most common in children between the ages of 5 and 12 years and adults older than 60. It tends to affects males and females equally.']","['Treatment of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis usually involves treating the bacterial infection (if necessary), monitoring and supporting kidney function and treating the symptoms.

['Preeclampsia'],"['Preeclampsia, also spelled pre-eclampsia and formerly sometimes called toxemia, is a potentially serious condition that affects only pregnant women after the 20th week of pregnancy or shortly after delivery.[1] Its characteristic symptoms are sudden-onset proteinuria (protein in the urine) and hypertension (high blood pressure). It is not yet known for certain what causes preeclampsia, but it may have something to do with abnormalities of the placental blood supply. Preeclampsia may also occur alongside HELLP syndrome, which is very serious and may progress to eclampsia, which is also very serious and may be fatal.', 'Preeclampsia affects only between about two and eight of every 100 pregnant women.[2] Severe preeclampsia affects only about one in every 200 pregnancies. HELLP Syndrome has a similar incidence, but around half of women with severe preeclampsia will develop HELLP Syndrome. Rates of eclampsia are low in most developed countries, with an incidence of around one in every 2000 pregnancies. However, the rate is considerably higher in developing countries.[3]']","['Preeclampsia is often diagnosed during a routine visit to the doctor.

It appears to involve inflammation of maternal blood vessels, particularly those in the kidneys. This may be due to abnormalities in the way that the placental blood supply develops, which can impact the effectiveness of the attachment of the placenta to the uterine wall.[3] An imperfect attachment may cause inflammatory substances to be released into the mother’s bloodstream. It is not yet known whether preeclampsia is caused by these abnormalities or whether these abnormalities and preeclampsia share a cause.', 'There is some evidence that preeclampsia and heart disease share some risk factors, namely:[18]', '\nEndothelial dysfunction (dysfunction of the lining of the blood vessels and lymph glands)\nObesity\nHypertension\nHyperglycemia\nInsulin resistance\nDyslipidemia (high levels of lipids in the blood).\n', 'There also appears to be a genetic component that determines a person’s risk of developing preeclampsia. If a pregnant person’s mother and/or sisters have a history of preeclampsia, their risk of preeclampsia is higher than that of a person without such a family history. Having had a previous pregnancy with preeclampsia also increases risk.[19] In such high-risk pregnancies, there is some evidence that a daily low dose (81mg/day) of aspirin may have a protective effect.[20]', 'While the cause is uncertain, the risk factors for preeclampsia are well-known. Risk of preeclampsia is higher in women who:[1][2][4]', '\nHave diabetes (type 1, type 2 or gestational diabetes)\nAre pregnant for the first time\nAre pregnant for the first time in 10 years\nAre having a multiple pregnancy of twins, triplets, etc.\nHave a BMI of 35 or greater, or body weight of 90kg or greater\nAre older than 40 or younger than 17 years old\nHave existing high blood pressure\nHave existing kidney disease\nHave existing vascular disorders\nHave existing clotting disorders\nHave a history of preeclampsia\nHave a family history of preeclampsia\n', 'If you are worried you may have preeclampsia, start a symptom assessment.', 'Preeclampsia and diet', 'Preeclampsia is slightly more common among pregnant women from poorer communities, which may suggest that there is a connection between nutrition and preeclampsia.

A related theory is that overnutrition, especially obesity before and during pregnancy, as well as undernutrition, can both cause the risk of preeclampsia to rise. It has been suggested that low-protein diets, low-fat diets and low-energy diets may affect preeclampsia. Again, however, these hypotheses have not been proven.[21]', 'There is some evidence that preeclampsia and atherosclerosis share risk factors, including:[21]', '\nObesity\nInsulin resistance, a condition associated with type 2 diabetes, where the body does not respond to the hormone insulin, leading to high blood glucose levels\nThrombophilia, a condition causing blood clots to form\nHyperhomocysteinemia, abnormally high levels of the amino acid homocysteine in the blood\nAfrican heritage\n', 'The link appears to be that both conditions increase the number of oxidants in the body. Some studies have therefore suggested that antioxidants such as Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, or a Vitamin E-related compound such as tocopherol may be helpful in reducing the risk of preeclampsia. However, trials to test the efficacy of supplementing the diet of pregnant women with antioxidants like Vitamins E and C to help reduce the risk of preeclampsia have been inconclusive.[22] It is also possible that taking antioxidants as supplements might have a different effect to absorbing antioxidants through food. This theory is yet to be fully proven.[21]', 'Diets for preeclampsia', 'The only things that are proven to have a positive effect on reducing the risk of preeclampsia are calcium supplements and low-dose aspirin.. A diet high in fruit and vegetables is also known to have a beneficial effect on overall health among pregnant women, therefore reducing the risk of conditions that increase the risk of preeclampsia. Lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking and cutting out alcohol can also help.', 'It is important to note that calcium supplementation to prevent preeclampsia is only effective in women who have low calcium intake in their diets: it does not make a difference if the pregnant person’s diet already had adequate calcium.[21] If a pregnant person is concerned that they may have low calcium, they can ask their doctor to run a test.', 'Omega-3 supplementation may have a protective effect against preeclampsia, but this is not known for sure. It was also formerly thought that sodium (salt) intake should be restricted to prevent preeclampsia, and, while a low-salt diet will reduce the risk of hypertension, it should not be done if it affects adequate intake of protein, calcium and energy.[21]', 'Good to know: It is not safe for a pregnant person to begin to take unprescribed supplements or to make any significant modifications to their diets without consulting with their pregnancy care team first.', 'Good to know: Nobody is as yet certain whether diet can increase someone’s risk of developing preeclampsia or whether there is a way to reduce the risk of preeclampsia  significantly by following a particular diet.[21] A diet however that may lead to substantial weight gain or obesity may increase risk and should therefore not be followed.', 'Pregnant women should not modify their diets or begin dietary supplementation without consulting their OB-GYN team or primary physician.']","['Deciding which treatment option for preeclampsia is best involves balancing the severity of the preeclampsia with the risks facing the baby.

However, symptoms which could indicate a molar pregnancy, include vaginal bleeding, severe nausea and vomiting and tummy growth which is faster than normal.', 'Hyperemesis gravidarum', 'Sickness and vomiting is common during pregnancy, affecting roughly 75 percent of pregnant women.[22] For most women, this will disappear at around week 14. Hyperemesis gravidarum is defined as severe vomiting during pregnancy, which may occur several times per day and impair the ability to keep down food and liquids. The condition poses little risk to the baby if managed properly, though a doctor or midwife should be contacted as soon as the condition is suspected.[23]', 'Low amniotic fluid (oligohydramnios)', 'Amniotic fluid helps the baby to develop in the womb, making it a vital part of the baby’s life-support system. If the level of amniotic fluid in the womb is low, this is a condition known as oligohydramnios. The condition can develop at any point during pregnancy, but is most common during the final trimester.', 'If it occurs in the first half of pregnancy, oligohydramnios can cause birth defects and an increased risk of miscarriage. If it occurs in the second half of pregnancy, complications include premature birth and problems during labor, such as cord compression. Amniotic fluid levels are monitored closely throughout pregnancy, and if oligohydramnios is detected, doctors will be able to suggest treatment methods, which, if the mother is in the final stages of pregnancy, may include inducing labor.[24]', 'Miscarriage', 'Miscarriage occurs when an embryo or fetus dies during the first 23 weeks of pregnancy, with most miscarriages happening within the first three months. It is often difficult to identify exactly what causes miscarriage, though some known causes include gene defects, pre-existing condition, (such as diabetes, and severe infection. See this resource on miscarriage for more information.', 'In some cases, there will be no apparent signs of a miscarriage, and it will only become apparent during a scan.[25] In other cases, symptoms may include vaginal bleeding, stomach pain and cramping, though these symptoms may be a sign of another condition and not miscarriage. If any of these symptoms occur, it is important to seek medical attention as soon as possible to enable a doctor to identify the problem.[26] See this resource on signs of miscarriage for more information about spotting its various potential indicators.', 'Stillbirth', 'A stillbirth is when a baby is born dead after 24 weeks of pregnancy. The cause of stillbirth cannot always be identified, though in some cases it is linked to problems with the placenta or the health of the mother. If the baby is moving less frequently than usual or not moving at all, a doctor or midwife should be contacted urgently. They will be able to run tests and identify any problems that may be occuring.[27]', 'Obstetric cholestasis', 'Obstetric cholestasis is a relatively rare liver condition occurring when the normal level of bile exiting the liver is reduced. The main symptom of obstetric cholestasis is pruritus, itching, sparing the face, which can range in severity from mild to severe. This symptom alone is typically enough for a presumptive diagnosis. Although this itching can occur at any point during pregnancy, it is most common in the final three months. Generally, the itching will cease soon after birth and cause no long-term health problems, though skin tissue damage (excoriation) is possible. The condition has, however, been linked to premature birth and stillbirth in some cases, meaning it will be closely monitored by doctors and midwives. Birth may be induced early (after 37 or 38 weeks) to reduce the risk of stillbirth if the condition is considered to be severe.[28]', 'Preterm (premature) labor and birth', 'Preterm labor is defined as contractions beginning and the cervix shortening before week 37 of pregnancy, with most occurrences taking place between week 34 and week 37. Preterm labor is relatively common, and only roughly one in five cases of preterm labor result in premature birth. Although it is difficult for doctors to foresee which women will experience preterm labor, certain factors – such as carrying twins or triplets, having experienced preterm labor in the past and some medical conditions (high blood pressure, for example) – make it more likely.', 'If preterm labor begins in a pregnancy of 34 weeks or over, doctors will typically allow the birth to continue naturally, as the baby will often be sufficiently mature to survive outside of the womb. This, however, depends on the specific circumstances. If preterm labor begins in a pregnancy of under 34 weeks, doctors may use methods to delay the birth, until the baby can be given steroids to prepare it for birth, and the mother can be transferred to a specialist care unit. In some cases, labor may be halted completely, though this is generally not advised.[29]', 'If a baby is born before week 37 of pregnancy, they are at risk of being underdeveloped and suffering potentially lifelong health issues and disabilities, such as cerebral palsy and learning disabilities. The earlier the birth, the higher the chances of health issues, with babies born before week 34 being most vulnerable.[30]', 'Preeclampsia', 'Preeclampsia is a condition involving pregnant women developing high blood pressure and protein in the urine (proteinuria), usually after week 20 of pregnancy. These symptoms will typically only be detected during a routine check-up, though other symptoms, such as headaches, vision problems and swelling of the feet, ankles, face and hands may also occur.[31]', 'Should such symptoms present, pregnant women should visit their doctor to identify what is causing them. In the majority of cases, preeclampsia will result in no serious health problems for mother or baby and will disappear soon after birth. However, in rare instances, preeclampsia can result in serious health issues such as fits and blood clotting problems. Gestational hypertension can also occur without the appearance of protein in the urine (proteinuria). The condition may also result in gestational hypertension. Proper monitoring of the condition by healthcare professionals can help reduce the chances of such complications occurring.[32]', 'Rhesus problems', 'Each person’s blood falls into one of four blood groups (A, B, AB, O) and is either rhesus (Rh) positive or negative. If a pregnant woman has rhesus negative blood and her baby has rhesus positive blood, the body’s immune system may detect these foreign blood cells and produce antibodies to attack them.', 'If this happens, the baby can develop rhesus disease which can cause anemia and jaundice in newborns. This, however, is rare. Newly pregnant women routinely undergo blood tests to identify whether they are rhesus positive or negative. If they are found to be rhesus negative they will be prescribed anti-D immunoglobulin injections at 28 to 32 weeks’ gestation and again within 72 hours of birth to prevent the immune system from producing antibodies to attack the baby’s blood cells.[3]', 'Pregnancy complications in multiple pregnancy - twins, triplets, etc.', 'The majority of women who are pregnant with multiple babies, whether twins, triplets or more, will experience no serious complications. However, the higher the number of babies in one pregnancy, the higher the risk of problems. Due to this, women pregnant with more than one baby will be monitored even more closely than usual.[33]', 'The most common complications associated with a multiple birth include:[33][34]', '\nPremature labor and birth\nLow birth weight\nGestational diabetes\nGestational hypertension\nAnemia\nMiscarriage\nCongenital deformity, including anencephaly, facial clefts and malformations of the spine\n', 'If it becomes apparent that a woman is pregnant with two or more babies, doctors and midwives will advise on the necessary steps to help avoid complications.', 'Pregnancy complications FAQs', 'Q: What are the possible complications of early pregnancy?\nA: In early pregnancy, generally defined as the first trimester, complications are commonly due to the pregnancy not forming properly and consequently becoming unviable. This will typically occur before the mother becomes aware she is pregnant, or very soon afterwards, and cause miscarriage. Abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding are common signs of early pregnancy miscarriage; if this occurs, women are advised to contact a doctor urgently. Vaginal bleeding and abdominal cramping can also occur in otherwise healthy pregnancies, so are not necessarily signs of miscarriage.[35]', 'Q: Can a vegan or vegetarian diet cause complications during pregnancy?\nA: Research suggests that people who follow a vegan or vegetarian diet may be at higher risk of having a baby with birth defects. This is thought to be due to a deficiency of vitamin B12, which is commonly found in animal products. Vegan or vegetarian women who are trying to become pregnant should talk to a doctor, who will be able to advise on ways in which to mitigate this risk. This will usually be through supplementation.[35]', 'Q: Can an IUD cause pregnancy complications?\nA: An intrauterine device, otherwise known as an IUD or coil, is a device fitted in the uterus to prevent pregnancy. Although IUDs are one of the most effective methods of contraception, in rare instance, a woman can become pregnant despite use of the device. If this occurs, the IUD will be immediately removed. Research suggests that if a pregnancy occurs in this way, there is no significant risk of the pregnancy being miscarried or of the baby being born with defects.[36]', '', '\n\nNHS Choices. “What are the risks of chickenpox during pregnancy?” October 24, 2016.

['Premature Labor'],"['Premature labor, or preterm labor, is labor that begins after the 20th week and before the 37th week of pregnancy. Labor is defined as the the beginning of regular contractions and the shortening of the cervix (opening of the womb). Most cases of premature labor occur between the 34th week and the 37th week.', 'Premature labor is relatively common, taking place in roughly 7 in 100 single baby births. In pregnancies of twins or triplets, premature labor is even more common – the average delivery date for twins is the 37th week and for triplets, the 33rd week.[1] A variety of other factors, including smoking and drinking alcohol during pregnancy, can also make premature labor more likely.', 'Roughly 1 in 10 cases of premature labour will result in a premature birth.[2] In cases where the baby is sufficiently developed to survive after birth (usually babies older than 34 weeks), labor will generally be allowed to progress naturally. If the baby is less developed (pre-34 weeks), a variety of methods can be used to delay labor until the baby is sufficiently mature.']","['The symptoms and warning signs of premature labor include:[1]', '\nThe waters breaking (rupture of the membranes). The pregnant woman may feel a soft popping sensation, followed by a slow trickle or gush of clear or pinkish liquid from the vagina.

These may be regular and are often painless.\n', 'Other symptoms of premature labor include:', '\nAn aching back\nStrong cramps (which may be painful)\nA need to urinate often\nPressure in the pelvis\nNausea, vomiting and/or diarrhoea\nThe mucus plug in the cervix comes away\n', 'These symptoms may also occur if an individual is not in premature labor. However, a pregnant woman experiencing any of these symptoms should contact their doctor or midwife urgently.']","['In many cases, the cause of premature labor cannot be clearly identified. However, several factors are known to make premature labor more likely.', 'Factors that make premature pregnancy more likely include:[1][3]', '\nWomb or cervical abnormalities\nCarrying twins or triplets\nExcess fluid in the womb (polyhydramnios)\nPlacenta praevia (when the placenta attaches near or over the cervical opening)\nCervical insufficiency (when the cervix begins to open prematurely)\nFertility treatment (for the current pregnancy)\nLess than six months between two pregnancies\nPremature birth in previous pregnancy\nPremature rupture of membranes (waters breaking before labor has begun) in a previous pregnancy\nLate miscarriage in a previous pregnancy\n', 'Factors concerning the pregnant woman’s health can also make premature labor more likely.

Nevertheless, the birth should still take place in a hospital where specialist care can be administered should it be necessary.\nArtificially delaying birth to allow time for doctors to prepare the baby for birth (usually steroids will be used to mature the baby’s lungs) and transfer the mother to a specialist care unit. This option will generally be advised in pregnancies of under 34 weeks. Birth will normally be delayed for at least 48 hours, and ideally for longer if needed. Due to the possible complications, this option is usually avoided if possible.\nAccelerating delivery using medication or caesarean section. This option will typically be chosen if the mother and/or baby are unwell.\n']"
['Premenstrual Syndrome'],"['The term premenstrual syndrome (PMS) describes a variety of physical and emotional changes that may occur in a woman in the days before her menstrual period begins. This condition is very common, and affects the majority of menstruating women in one way or another. These changes include a low mood, increased appetite, tender breasts, mood changes, irritability and acne. The severity of symptoms varies from person to person. These symptoms tend to repeat in a predictable pattern before a period. Treatment involves lifestyle changes and medications which help to manage the menstrual cycle. Although PMS cannot be cured, the symptoms can usually be well managed.']","[""Typical symptoms of PMS include emotional and physical symptoms.

This may be achieved by making lifestyle changes or with medications. Regular exercise, having a good support network and learning relaxation techniques may be helpful in reducing symptoms. Some medications are helpful, including the (oral contraceptive) pill, and low dose anti-depressant medications. In severe cases, surgical removal of the ovaries may be an option. This causes infertility, so it is most appropriate for women who are not planning to become pregnant.']"
['Prenatal Diagnosis'],"['Prenatal diagnosis uses a variety of testing methods to determine whether a fetus has certain genetic or physical abnormalities before birth. At different stages during pregnancy, these methods are used to detect issues such as Down syndrome (trisomy 21), hemophilia, thalassemia, Turner syndrome, spina bifida and Huntington’s disease.', 'The International Society for Prenatal Diagnosis (ISPD) was founded in 1996 to advance the “science and practice of genetics and fetal care worldwide [and] promote the health of children, their mothers and their families.“[1]', 'What is prenatal screening?', 'Prenatal screening tests can determine the likelihood of a fetus having an abnormality. Parents at particular risk of certain problems may choose to use a variety of prenatal diagnostic tests. This decision is based on factors including their level of risk, the prenatal (before birth) or postnatal (after birth) care required to address a particular issue, and the parents’ comfort with their risk level.', 'Prenatal screening consists of non-invasive tests, including:', '\nUltrasound\nMaternal serum tests\nPrenatal cell-free DNA (cfDNA) screening (to determine the likelihood that a fetus will have a genetic disorder)\n', 'These screenings are considered together to determine a statistical probability of an issue occurring, but they cannot diagnose the existence of these issues with certainty. If a fetus is determined to have a high likelihood of a genetic abnormality, parents are encouraged to undergo diagnostic testing such as amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS), which directly test the fetal cells. The amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS) tests are more definitive than non-invasive screenings, but do carry risks to the fetus, such as miscarriage or congenital abnormalities.**', 'Purposes of prenatal diagnosis', 'In testing for these potential issues, prenatal diagnosis provides information to parents and doctors as early as possible, so that they can determine the best course of care for the fetus, both before and after birth. It can also detect issues that, if left unaddressed, could result in negative outcomes (including death) for the fetus or mother. This knowledge can lessen the risk for conditions requiring prenatal care or that may result in more difficult births.', 'Additionally, this can tell the doctors whether they should prepare to administer special care to the infant right after birth. It can also allow parents to prepare physically, emotionally and/or financially for the chance that their child will have specific medical needs. Some parents may choose to terminate the pregnancy if the information discovered during prenatal testing suggests that the fetus will not develop into a healthy baby, would not survive long outside the womb or would have an extremely poor quality of life.[2]', 'Prenatal diagnostic tests', 'Amniocentesis', 'Amniocentesis is an invasive prenatal diagnostic test in which a long, thin needle is passed through the mother’s abdomen (belly) and uterus into the amniotic sac to extract amniotic fluid. The fetal cells in the amniotic fluid are analyzed for irregularities in chromosomes and biochemicals. This test is usually performed in the second trimester at between 14-20 weeks of pregnancy, or as early as amniotic fluid levels will permit testing.', 'Amniocentesis can also be used to test for:', '\nRhesus factor: This is a very important blood factor which can cause problems when the baby’s Rh factor is different to that of the pregnant person. This can cause Rh sensitization if blood passes between the developing fetus and the mother.\nFetal lung development (by the third trimester)\n', 'Women may experience discomfort and cramping during this test, and should rest for the remainder of the day after it is administered. In rarer cases they may also be advised to rest for 24 or even up to 48 hours after the procedure.', 'Amniocentesis can detect chromosomal disorders such as Down syndrome; genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis; and neural tube defects such as spina bifida.[3] It is not used to detect structural birth defects. Due to its ability to also determine a baby’s gender, amniocentesis is subject to legal restrictions in some countries.', 'The fetus is not injured during amniocentesis, though the procedure does slightly increase the risk of miscarriage.', 'Chorionic villus sampling (CVS)', 'Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) is typically carried out by passing a catheter, guided by ultrasound, from the vagina through the cervix and into the uterus, accessing the chorionic villi cells of the placenta. These cells share genetic material with the fetus. Depending on the placement of the placenta in the mother’s body, it may also be administered transabdominally (through the belly), using a long thin needle, in a procedure similar to amniocentesis.', 'These cells are then analyzed using a variety of methods, with the most common being chromosomal analysis. CVS detects almost all chromosomal disorders, such as Down syndrome, as well as hundreds of genetic disorders, such as sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs disease. It does not detect neural tube defects. Unclear results showing a discrepancy between the chromosomes of the cells in the placenta and the cells in the baby, called placental mosaicism, occur between 1-2% of the time with CVS. Amniocentesis (another test to check for chromosomal conditions) may be necessary to gain definitive results.[4]', 'CVS can be administered as early as 10 weeks into the pregnancy, in the first trimester. Mothers do not typically experience pronounced discomfort during the test, but some may have light bleeding (spotting) afterwards.', 'CVS is considered an invasive test, and carries a slightly higher risk of miscarriage than does amniocentesis, as well as other possible risks, including infection or Rh sensitization (in which the Rh positive blood cells from the baby enter the pregnant person’s bloodstream, potentially causing pregnancy complications). In rare cases, it is linked to fetal deformities of the fingers and toes, but current research suggests that this risk is smaller if the test is done after the 11th week of pregnancy.', 'Preimplantation genetic diagnosis', 'When an embryo is created for use in in-vitro fertilization (IVF), cells removed from the embryo can be used to diagnose chromosomal abnormalities and genetic disorders prior to implantation. The fetus produced by a screened embryo is extremely unlikely to have the tested disorder. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis may also be called preimplantation genetic profiling.', 'Prenatal screening', 'Ultrasound', 'Ultrasound is a common and non-invasive procedure that uses sound waves passing through the womb and the fetus to create an image of the fetus’s body and development. It is typically used to screen for structural birth defects at between 16-20 weeks of pregnancy. Ultrasound testing is useful for physical issues such as heart malformations or cleft palates, and to detect the fetus’s position in the womb, but it is not as effective as the invasive means mentioned above to detect genetic issues.', 'An ultrasound test for fetal nuchal translucency (NT) monitors the back of the fetus’s neck for signs of thickening or increased fluid, an early sign of problems such as Down syndrome, trisomy 18 or heart issues.', 'Prenatal cell-free DNA (cfDNA) screening', 'Prenatal cell-free DNA (cfDNA) screening is a relatively new, non-invasive test for the likelihood that a fetus will have  some chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome, trisomy 13 or trisomy 18. In some cases, it can screen for increased risk of trisomy 16, trisomy 22, triploidy, sex chromosome aneuploidy (abnormal number of sex chromosomes), Prader-Willi syndrome and other microdeletion syndromes, as well as some single-gene disorders affecting the fetus’s skeleton and bones. It can also determine the sex and rhesus blood type (Rh) of the developing fetus. As this test screens maternal blood to locate fetal DNA entering the mother’s body through the placenta, its samples are too small for some common testing procedures, so it is only useful for certain conditions, like the ones mentioned above.', 'CfDNA screening can be carried out after the 10th week of pregnancy, and does not increase risk of miscarriage. However, women who are obese, carrying more than one fetus or pregnant with a donor egg or as a gestational carrier (also known as a surrogate mother) may not receive accurate results from this test. It is often recommended for women with increased risk of having a baby with chromosomal abnormalities – such as older mothers or mothers who have previously given birth to a baby with these conditions – and for women with Rh negative blood types.', 'Screening for Rh status', 'A very small proportion of the population has Rh negative blood types, and if a mother with Rh negative blood is carrying a baby with Rh positive blood, meaning they are Rh incompatible, it can cause complications. If fetal blood enters the mother’s circulatory system, it triggers the production of antibodies in the mother’s system that can subsequently, most likely when the mother will be pregnant with her second Rh positive baby, attack the Rh factor in the fetus’s blood.', 'This will damage the babies’  red blood cells and cause anemia in the baby. This condition, which is unlikely to develop under effective prenatal care, is called Rh disease and can lead to complications including jaundice, brain damage, miscarriage or stillbirth.', 'The administration of a Rh immune globulin shot to the mother following any chance of exposure to fetal blood prevents these antibodies from forming. Typically, fetal blood only enters the mother’s system during birth, so these antibodies would attack the next fetus with Rh positive blood that the mother carries. In some cases, though, fetal blood can enter the mother’s body during routine testing such as amniocentesis or CVS – due to vaginal bleeding, an ectopic pregnancy or an abdominal injury – so a Rh negative mother will receive the Rh immune globulin shot within 72 hours to prevent antibody formation.', 'This screening is important, as once the antibodies are in the mother’s system, they cannot be removed. They increase, along with the potential for damage to the fetus, with each Rh positive fetus that the mother carries or gives birth to. There are effective treatments for Rh disease after the fetus’s birth, including blood transfusions.', 'Maternal serum tests and quad screen test', 'Numerous blood tests are a part of prenatal screening, and may be administered at various times throughout the pregnancy. These are non-invasive tests.', 'Pregnancy associated plasma protein screening (PAPP-A)', 'Usually measured in the first trimester, this test monitors the level of a protein produced by the placenta. High levels may be associated with chromosomal abnormalities such as trisomy 13, 18 and 21, while low levels can indicate that the fetus may be underweight or stillborn. High levels may also indicate an unusually large fetus.', 'Alpha-fetoprotein screening (AFP)', 'Alpha-fetoprotein screening (AFP) tests the levels of alpha-fetoprotein, a fetal liver protein that can cross into the mother’s blood. It is one of the second trimester tests referred to as quad screen test, and it is usually performed along with three other tests, for HCG, estriol and inhibin.', 'High levels of this protein can suggest neural tube defects such as spina bifida or anencephaly, but not with certainty, as AFP levels can be elevated for several reasons – such as if the fetus’s conception time (the moment the father’s sperm impregnates the mother’s egg) is not accurately known. Abnormal levels of AFP can also indicate chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome, defects in the fetus’s abdominal wall, or the carriage of multiple fetuses.', 'Beta-HCG screening', 'High levels of this placental protein may indicate chromosomal abnormalities. Combined with maternal serum AFP (MSAFP) results, it can suggest Down syndrome.[5] This is one of the quad screen test markers.', 'Estriol screening', 'Another one of the quad screen tests, the test for estriol levels indicates whether the mother is healthy, the fetus is viable and the placenta is functioning. Low levels of estriol in the third trimester may indicate Down syndrome, adrenal hypoplasia with anencephaly or that an emergency delivery is necessary.', 'Inhibin-A', 'High levels of inhibin-A can be associated with trisomy 21, while lower levels might indicate that the baby is at risk of an early delivery. It is one of the four markers in the quad screen test.', 'Risks of prenatal diagnosis', 'Although every pregnancy carries the risk of miscarriage, non-invasive screenings like ultrasound, prenatal cell-free DNA (cfDNA) screening or maternal serum tests do not increase this risk. They are not linked to any risks for the developing fetus or pregnant person, other than the usual risks involved with drawing a blood sample from the mother’s veins, including bruising of the site and slight pain where the needle enters the vein.', 'Both CVS and amniocentesis carry an additional risk of miscarriage compared to other tests.[6]  This is due to the nature of the procedure (an injection which passes through the wall of the womb).', '\nFor amniocentesis, the increased risk of miscarriage is approximately 1 percent, meaning that 1 in 100 people who undergo this test will miscarry as a result.\nFor CVS, the increased risk of miscarriage is 1-2 percent, meaning that 1-2 in 100 people who undergo the CVS test will miscarry as a result.\n', 'Although these tests are performed safely and do not result in miscarriage in the majority of cases. Doctors will recommend these tests only in cases where they feel that the information gained about possible problems which can then be treated will significantly outweigh the risk of miscarriage.', 'Continuous guidance by ultrasound during the procedure can minimize this risk, as it helps ensure that only one attempt will be necessary. In rare cases, CVS has been linked to fetal deformities of the fingers and toes, but current research suggests that this risk is lowered if the test is done after the 11th week of pregnancy.', 'Preimplantation genetic diagnosis can have major risks, including death of the embryo due to the procedure or due to thawing from cryopreservation. It can also be linked to the potential for an unsuccessful birth of the fetus.', 'FAQ', 'Q:Who should use prenatal diagnosis?\nA: Prenatal diagnosis may be suggested to women older than 35 years old or who have issues such as high blood pressure, diabetes, epilepsy or lupus, as they are at higher risk to carry a fetus with certain problems. It is also recommended for women whose partners have genetic disorders, women who have previously had children with these issues or women who are pregnant with more than one fetus.', 'Due to the risks to the fetus associated with invasive testing, many women start with non-invasive genetic risk screenings, which can reveal their fetus’s likelihood of risk, but cannot provide a true diagnosis. Women who receive a high-risk score may then choose to undergo prenatal diagnostic testing. Women have different levels of comfort with risk, and may choose to undergo prenatal diagnostic testing at higher or lower risk levels.', 'Preconception genetic screening (screening the individual partners for conditions before the egg and sperm have fused and produced the embryo) is also available, which can tell parents whether they are likely to pass on certain genetic conditions but – as there is no fetus in the mother’s uterus at the time – it does not reveal a particular fetus’s risk of abnormality.', 'Depending on the health system, some doctors make testing for some birth defects available to all mothers regardless of their risk screenings, and allow the mother to decide.', 'Q: What is prenatal diagnosis for Down syndrome?\nA: Two major types of prenatal testing for Down syndrome exist: prenatal screening and diagnostic testing. Prenatal screening is typically a combination of maternal serum tests, an ultrasound and statistical information about the mother’s age. These tests cannot definitively diagnose Down syndrome, but can give the likelihood that the fetus will have Down syndrome, with an accuracy of about 80%. Prenatal cell-free DNA (cfDNA) screening has recently emerged as another screening method, with higher accuracy. These screenings are offered to pregnant people in most medical contexts,  regardless of age, and are often completed by 14 weeks, within the first trimester.', 'Amniocentesis and CVS are diagnostic tests that can diagnose Down syndrome with nearly 100% accuracy, however, they also may lead to a higher risk of miscarriage, as high as 1 or 2% higher than the general risk for miscarriage any mother has.[7] For this reason, they are often recommended only to women who have undergone a prenatal screening and found to be carrying a fetus likely to have Down syndrome.', 'Q: What is prenatal diagnosis for autism?\nA: Right now, there is no definitive prenatal diagnosis for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the fetus. There is some evidence that a fetus with ASD undergoes faster growth of the brain and body during the second trimester, and these changes can be made visible by ultrasound. Some evidence also suggests abnormal development of some parts of the brain.[8] Not all babies that will develop ASD have chromosomal abnormalities, so many prenatal diagnostic tests have little to no effectiveness in that regard.', '', '\n\n""International Society for Prenatal Diagnosis.""

['Preparing for a Colonoscopy'],"['A colonoscopy involves inserting a thin, flexible tube called a colonoscope into the body through the anus to examine the colon (large intestine) and rectum. The main purpose of a colonoscopy is to investigate symptoms which may be coming from the colon and colorectal area, such as:', '\nAbdominal pain\nConstipation\nPassing blood with bowel movements.\nPersistent diarrhoea\n', 'During a colonoscopy it is possible to identify growths and other intestinal problems; including:', '\nNon-cancerous polyps\nColon cancers\nBleeding\nAreas of inflammation\n', 'It is necessary for the whole colon to be visible to the video camera on the end of the colonoscope, otherwise it is impossible to carry out this screening process effectively. If you are concerned about the health of yourself or a loved one, download the Ada app for a free assessment.', 'People are recommended to follow particular instructions in preparation for a colonoscopy, including following a specialized colonoscopy prep diet and activity plan. The purpose of this is to induce a kind of diarrhea, emptying the area to be screened of stool and other waste to ensure full visibility. This process is known as colonoscopy prep.', 'How to prepare for a colonoscopy: what to expect', 'The aim of colonoscopy prep is to ensure that the colon is empty and clean before the screening. This normally involves:', '\nFollowing a colonoscopy prep diet. This is made up of low fiber food; this stage lasts for three to four days, with a liquid-only food intake on the final day before the colonoscopy.\nDrinking bowel-cleaning liquids. These are medications called laxatives, which may take the form of pills or drinks, and which are taken to induce diarrhea. They will most commonly be taken the night before the screening, often with another dose on the morning of the screening. This is called a split-dose-regimen.[1][2]\nAn enema before the colonoscopy. This may be given in cases where the large intestine is difficult to empty, for example due to constipation.\n', 'Good to know: People preparing for a colonoscopy experience frequent bowel movements as the preparatory medications take effect, and will need ready access to a bathroom at all times. It is for this reason that clearing one’s schedule of appointments for at least one day before the screening and staying at home are both highly recommended.', 'Colonoscopy prep tips: creating the optimum setup', 'Before starting colonoscopy prep, most people find it helpful to shop for all the supplies that they will need. In addition to the foods and liquids that will be eaten as part of the food intake plan, people preparing for a colonoscopy may wish to purchase products to soothe the skin around the anus, specifically diaper cream (to soothe the skin) and alcohol-free cleansing wipes containing aloe-vera or vitamin E.', 'Food planning for colonoscopy prep: what to eat and what to avoid', 'During colonoscopy prep, one should aim to eat a diet which is nutritious, but which does not cause large amounts of feces to form in the intestine. Three days in advance, it is important to stop taking fiber supplement products, as these help the body to produce fecal matter and would work against the colonoscopy preparations.', 'At this point, it is important to stop taking all other supplements and vitamins, as well as any medicines that contain iron.[3] Physicians or hospital staff will advise on whether and when to stop taking any prescription medicines that are normally used regularly, and on the use of over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications, such as ibuprofen.', 'Low fiber food', 'Eating low-fiber food for three or four days before the procedure will help to empty the colon, because low-fiber foods are easy to digest and leave one’s system quickly.', 'Foods to avoid during colonoscopy prep include:', '\nFatty foods\nFruit with seeds or peel such as apples, berries or figs\nHigh-fibre cereals such as bran flakes or granola\nHigh-fibre vegetables such as corn, broccoli, cabbage, beans or peas\nLegumes such as dried peas, lentils or split peas\nSeeds, nuts or popcorn\nTough meat with gristle\nRaw vegetables\nWhole grains\n', 'Low-fibre food options which are suitable for colonoscopy prep include:', '\nCooked vegetables without skin or peel\nEggs\nFish\nFruit without skin or seeds\nLean meat such as chicken, turkey or veal\nWell-cooked vegetables without skin\nBreads and cakes made with refined white flour such as bagels, muffins or rolls\nPasta and rice\nPotatoes without skin\nSmooth peanut butter or almond butter\n', 'Avoid solids', 'The day before before the colonoscopy, it is recommended to avoid solid food completely. Consuming liquids only for this time period helps prevent new fecal matter from forming, entering the colon and being present during the screening, and will ensure that the colon remains empty and clean.', 'It is important to avoid red and purple food dyes[4] as they can discolor the lining of the colon and make it harder to see the area being examined during the colonoscopy.', 'Drinks and liquid foods which are suitable to eat the day before the screening include:', '\nClear broth, including chicken, beef, or vegetable\nClear, light-colored juices such as apple, white grape, lemonade without pulp, and white cranberry\nFlavored water\nJell-O or other gelatin without fruit (taking care to avoid red and purple food colouring)\nPopsicles without fruit or cream\nWater\nSoda\nSports drinks such as Gatorade and Propel (light colors only)\nTea and black coffee without any cream, milk or sweetener\n', 'Cleansing the bowel', 'The aim of colonoscopy prep is to pass all the fecal matter from the area to be examined during the screening, so that there is nothing left to obstruct the view of the colonoscope. To aid the process of emptying the bowel, one will be prescribed a laxative product to take as part of the colonoscopy prep. In some cases, enemas may also be prescribed.', 'Good to know: Many people pass clear, yellow liquid once they have finished passing waste. This yellow liquid which a person may pass is made up of digestive juices and does not indicate that the prep has been ineffective. However, if the person preparing for the colonoscopy is still passing liquid containing fecal matter, or brown, cloudy liquid, they should seek medical advice as they will need to take additional steps to clean their colorectal region before the screening can be performed.', 'Colonoscopy prep medications', 'Laxative medications help the stool to pass smoothly through the colon.', 'Before a colonoscopy, osmotic laxatives are most commonly prescribed. These work to empty the bowel by drawing the water from the large intestine into the stool in order to soften it, making it easier to pass. These are usually drunk dissolved in large amounts of water. Specific instructions for preparing the solution vary from brand to brand, and will found be on the packet of the product that has been prescribed.', 'Seek medical advice if there is any confusion about how to prepare the solution and when to take it. Because these medications work by keeping water in the bowel, it is important to drink enough liquid to stay hydrated. Drink water, or one of the recommended liquids, regularly throughout the colonoscopy prep plan.', 'Good to know: It is important, and not harmful, for a person preparing for a colonoscopy to drink the prep solution as planned, even if they already have diarrhea before starting to to take it. The prep solution is designed to ensure that any solid stool which may have formed higher up in the colon is passed before the scan.', 'How long should colonoscopy prep take to start working?', 'Most colonoscopy prep products start working two to three hours after they are taken, although the exact time-frame varies between medications. In some cases, if bowel movements do not begin to occur when expected, an extra dose may be needed. However, it is always advisable to follow the specific instructions that come with the product in relation to taking an extra dose and to consult with one’s medical provider in case of any doubts.', 'How to drink colonoscopy prep medications without throwing up', 'It is possible for drinking the solution to make one feel nauseous. Tips which may help a person to avoid nausea include:', '\nSipping the solution slowly\nTaking breaks between sips\nUsing a straw\nCooling the liquid instead of drinking it at room temperature\n', 'If nausea is known to be a problem for the affected person in general, or has been experienced in a previous screening, anti-nausea medications may be recommended.[5]', 'To avoid vomiting, it can also be helpful to leave longer intervals between drinks. If someone does vomit after consuming a dose of the solution during their colonoscopy prep, it is important to repeat the dose.', 'How to tell if colonoscopy prep has been effective: what to expect', 'Prep is complete when bowel movements become watery and clear. This means that the colon is empty of fecal matter and is ready to be viewed by the colonoscopy camera without obstructions. The length of time that it takes to reach this point will vary between people and will depend on factors, such as their overall gastrointestinal health, and how well the prep diet plan was followed.', 'Good to know: When bowel movements become clear enough to see the bottom of the toilet bowl, colonoscopy prep can be considered complete.', 'Seek medical attention if significant amounts of blood, or blood clots, are passed during colonoscopy prep. Colonoscopy prep may cause any hemorrhoids that are present to bleed slightly, as they might normally during a bowel movement. In all cases where bleeding appears to come from a source other than existing hemorrhoids, or is excessive, a medical opinion should be sought as soon as possible, and the bleeding should be mentioned before the procedure.[6]', 'What to do if colonoscopy prep is not working', 'The purpose of colonoscopy prep is to remove all fecal matter from the bowel. If a person usually suffers from constipation or chronic constipation, they may need an extended prep period before their colonoscopy. It is helpful to discuss constipation issues with the doctor when planning a colonoscopy, so that the preparation time can be adjusted if needed.', 'An extended preparation period typically involves the use of enemas and doubling the colonoscopy prep time-frame. Prep will then involve a period of over three or four days of eating low-fiber food, followed by two days of consuming nutritious liquids and colonoscopy prep solution.', 'Enemas', 'In some cases, following the specialized food intake plan and using laxatives are sufficient to empty the bowel. However, other people, particularly those who are suffering from constipation, may need additional assistance to empty the bowel before their colonoscopy. If the bowel is not fully empty following colonoscopy prep, an enema will be prescribed.', 'The type of enema which is incorporated into colonoscopy prep is called a cleansing enema. It involves injecting liquid into the bowel via the rectum. This helps the body to push out any remaining waste. The liquid which will be used is usually a water-based solution with a small concentration of stool softener. The volume of water stimulates the movement of the large intestine, which in turn stimulates the bowels to expel both the solution and any remaining fecal matter.', 'If the bowel is not completely cleansed following an enema, the process can be repeated one or two more times. It is possible to undergo an enema in hospital, or to purchase an enema kit to carry out this process at home. The doctor will identify the most suitable option for the individual undergoing the colonoscopy.', 'Preparing for a colonoscopy: travel plans', 'A person can undergo a colonoscopy as an outpatient in most cases, arriving at the clinic and returning home the same day.', 'However, people undergoing a colonoscopy are usually given sedatives to help them relax and to ensure that they are comfortable during the colonoscopy. In all cases where sedatives are used, it is advisable to arrange for a friend or family member to accompany the person having the colonoscopy to and from the hospital. This is because, in general, avoiding activities such as driving is recommended for a time after the use of sedatives. The timeframe of this period depends on the specific sedative used.', 'Colonoscopy preparation FAQs', 'Q: Can I take routine medications whilst I am following my colonoscopy prep plan?\nA: In the run up to a colonoscopy, a person should take their routine medication as normal. On the day of the procedure, if it is scheduled for the morning, avoid taking any medication unless specified by medical personnel, with the exception of blood pressure, heart and seizure medication. If a colonoscopy is scheduled for the afternoon, a person may take their routine medication, other than medications that they were instructed to avoid.', 'Good to know: Pain medication that is part of the NSAID group, like ibuprofen or aspirin, has historically not been recommended for use for several days or even more than a week before screenings where an additional procedure that causes bleeding is scheduled, such as a biopsy or polypectomy. This is due to the perceived increased risk of postoperative bleeding.[7]', 'However, some recent research suggests that there may not be a need to avoid all NSAIDs. The increased risk of bleeding needs to be examined by differentiating between the different types of NSAID medicine, as not all of them will increase the risk in all cases. NSAIDs should only be used on a doctor’s recommendation. They will recommend NSAIDs based on criteria including:[8]', '\nWhether continuing or stopping medications that may already be in use will be better for the affected person\nThe overall risk of bleeding complications during the procedure\nWhether the risk of bleeding complications will be increased by the particular painkiller used\nThe risk of encountering a problem due to stopping the use of the painkiller, if used continuously.\n', 'Always follow a doctor’s recommendations closely before taking any medications, including NSAIDs, before a colonoscopy.', 'Q: What can I do to reduce feelings of hunger during my colonoscopy prep?\nA: It is normal to feel hungry whilst preparing for a colonoscopy, particularly in the liquid-only stage. It is important to follow the food intake plan in order to ensure that the prep is effective. Drinking sodas with a high sugar content can help to keep feelings of hunger at a minimum during this stage. Feelings of hunger are expected during this stage of prep and should not be a cause for concern; if hunger is excessively bothersome or results in feelings of pain, please consult the doctor.', 'Q: What do I do if colonoscopy prep medication makes me vomit?\nA: If the laxative solution makes you feel nauseous, the best thing to do is to take a break from your intended dose schedule and leave a longer interval before taking the next dose. Missing a dose should be avoided, and it is therefore important to drink a replacement dose if vomiting occurs after drinking the solution. Other tips that may help reduce the likelihood of nausea and the risk of vomiting, and which are alternatives to drinking the solution straight, include:', '\nDrinking the prep solution in small sips\nSucking hard candy or a chilled lemon slice in between sips\nUsing a straw\nChilling the prep solution and/or drinking cold water alongside it\nDiscussing the use of a suitable anti-nausea medication with your healthcare provider, if nausea is expected\n', 'Q: Can a colonoscopy detect colon cancer?**\nA: Yes. A colonoscopy may be used as part of the screening process to detect colon cancer; a screening will be ordered for anybody at high risk of colon cancer or if it is suspected. When somebody is undergoing treatment for colon cancer, a colonoscopy may be scheduled periodically in order to monitor whether the treatment is effective.[9] Feeling unwell? If you are concerned about the health of you or a loved one, get a free symptom assessment with the Ada app.', 'Q: Are polyps removed during a colonoscopy?\nA: During the colonoscopy procedure, it is possible to remove most polyps that are detected, in their entirety. This process is called polypectomy and can be performed using a range of different techniques, including removing the polyps with the help of an electrical current or cutting them off with a wire. In most cases, a person can undergo polypectomy during their colonoscopy as an outpatient.[10]', 'Q: How long do you poop after colonoscopy prep solution is taken?\nA: Most colonoscopy prep solutions begin working two to three hours after they are consumed, although this varies between products. Another dose may be needed if bowel movements do not occur when expected. If bowel movements do not occur after an additional dose, consult your medical care team. An extended prep time may be needed, and the scan may need to be rescheduled if it is not possible to cleanse the colon in time.', 'Q: What are the colonoscopy prep guidelines for people with diabetes?\nA: A person who is affected by diabetes and is due to undergo a colonoscopy will need to agree to a personalized colonoscopy prep plan with their doctor. In some cases, a person’s food intake plan and their normal dosing plan for taking insulin and other medications may need to be altered to accommodate colonoscopy prep. Their medical care team will work closely with them to ensure that their treatment regimen for diabetes is not disrupted in a way which could be harmful. People with diabetes who also have reduced kidney function will be prescribed a specialized laxative, rather than using generic colonoscopy prep products.[11]', 'Q: How long does diarrhea last after colonoscopy prep?\nA: For some people, diarrhea continues for a short amount of time after the procedure. A small amount of leakage may occur in the hours after the scan, and people may therefore be recommended to wear protective clothing and/or use fluid absorbing pads in their underwear during this time. A person’s food choices in the immediate period after their colonoscopy are believed to influence the likelihood of experiencing diarrhea; it is recommended to avoid fried food, and to opt for a healthy, solid meal.[3]', 'Q: Is there such a thing as a colonoscopy bag?\nA: Colonoscopy and colostomy sound similar, but they are different procedures, and there is no such thing as a colonoscopy bag.', 'A colonoscopy is a scan of the colorectal area, and does not involve a bag. In contrast, a colostomy, or bowel diversion, is a surgical procedure used to divert one end or a loop of the large intestine out through the wall of the abdomen or belly. An incision is made in the skin and through the abdominal wall to create an opening called a stoma, sometimes also known as an ostomy. Over this, a small pouch – known as a colostomy bag – is placed in order to collect excreted stool and other human waste.', '', ""\n\n“New guidelines issued on bowel prep for colonoscopy.” Medscape. 08 October 2014.

['Pressure Ulcer'],"['A pressure ulcer, also known as pressure sore or bed sore, is a wound caused by prolonged pressure on the skin. Typical locations for pressure sores are are the heels, ankles, hips and over the tailbone. Elderly people and bed- or wheelchair-bound are at risk of developing this condition. Symptoms may include pain in the area, red or purple skin, a break in the skin and, eventually, a wide-based sore which may get bigger over time. The diagnosis is usually easily based on the symptoms and appearance of the area of skin. Treatment involves taking steps to avoid pressure on the area, to keep the wound healthy and, if needed, to close the ulcer. If the wound is small, it may heal well, but large, complicated ulcers can take weeks to months to heal.']","['Typical symptoms include red or purple skin in the affected area, skin that is softer and thinner than the surrounding skin, a break in the skin, and an open sore with a wide base. These tend to occur in bony areas, such as over the tailbone, hips ankles and heels, although they can occur in other areas. There may be pain in the affected area, if the affected person does not have a loss of feeling which has contributed to the formation of the sore. If there is an infection, there may be pus in the sore, or it may have an unpleasant smell.']",,"['The treatment of pressure ulcer depends on the amount of damage to the skin and underlying tissues. Pressure damage with no broken skin and small ulcers can be healed by taking steps to avoid further pressure on the skin and allowing healing to occur. This involves frequent repositioning to spread pressure evenly over the body and using supportive surfaces, such as special mattresses or cushions. Pain relief may be required. If the wound is severe, surgical cleaning or a skin graft might be needed to repair the wound.']"
['Prostate Cancer'],"['Prostate cancer is a cancer of the prostate gland, a walnut-shaped gland which sits just below the bladder in males. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men. It tends to affect men over the age of 50, and becomes more common with age. Many people have no symptoms in the early stages, but when they occur, symptoms include difficulties with urination, weight loss and tiredness. As prostate cancer only causes symptoms as it progresses, screening (testing people without symptoms) can help to identify the cancer in the early stages. Treatment depends on the size of the cancer and whether it has spread at the time of diagnosis. This condition most often progresses slowly, and many people recover well with treatment.']","['There may be no symptoms in the early stages of prostate cancer. Urinary symptoms are common as the cancer progresses, and include difficulty beginning urination, a weak stream of urine and dribbling at the end of urination. As the cancer further progresses, some people may experience unintended weight loss, tiredness and general signs of illness may be present.']",,"['There are multiple options for treating prostate cancer, depending on the size of the cancer and whether it has spread. The general health of the affected person also influences the choice of treatment. As prostate cancer often develops very slowly, a doctor may recommend regular check-ups with no other treatment for people with a small cancer, especially in older men or men in poor health. Prostate cancer which requires treatment often involves removing the prostate, along with hormonal therapy, radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or a combination of these. The treating doctor can give the best advice in individual cases. If the cancer is not curable, people with prostate cancer are offered treatments which aim to improve their symptoms and quality of life.']"
['Prostatectomy (Prostate Surgery)'],"['A prostatectomy is a major procedure, carried out by a urological surgeon (urologist), in which all or part of the prostate gland is removed. A prostatectomy can be ordered by your doctor to treat prostate cancer and as part of treating some of the other types of cancer that can affect the pelvis.', 'A prostatectomy can often cure prostate cancer if it has not spread outside the prostate gland. Prostatectomies are also performed in the treatment of non-cancerous conditions affecting the prostate, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), when the prostate becomes enlarged and causes urinary problems,  and in rarer cases e.g. for prostatitis, an inflammation of the prostate.', 'There are several different methods of performing a prostatectomy. The method used depends on the reason the procedure is being performed. For example, a radical prostatectomy will be carried out as a treatment for malignant cancer. This type of prostatectomy involves the removal of the entire prostate gland as well as the vas deferens, the duct which conveys sperm from the testicals to the urethra, and the seminal vesicles, the glands which hold the liquid which mixes with sperm to make semen. However, a more benign condition, such as a prostate hyperplasia, would require a simple prostatectomy, in which only part of the prostate is removed.', 'Prostatectomies generally require general anesthesia, i.e. a kind of anesthesia where the person is asleep during the procedure and does not wake up till the surgery is entirely finished, and a hospital stay of two to three days on average, with a total recovery time of around one to two months. With appropriate aftercare, most people are able to resume physical activities as normal after around six weeks.', 'When and why is a prostatectomy performed?', 'A prostatectomy is performed in order to treat a variety of conditions which can affect the prostate gland. The prostate gland is the size of a walnut and is located inside the male body, beneath the bladder and between the bladder and the penis. Women also have a gland which is equivalent to the prostate gland, commonly referred to in medicine as the paraurethral gland or Skene’s gland,  but they are much less likely to be affected by problems in this area than men.', 'In healthy males, the prostate gland produces prostate fluid, one of the main components of semen. The prostate gland also contains muscle fibres. During ejaculation, the prostate functions to push the semen into the urethra, the duct in the penis which conveys urine and semen out of the body.', 'Prostate problems most commonly develop in later life, predominantly affecting men of over 50 years of age. Problems, which affect the prostate and may be addressed by a prostatectomy, include prostate cancer, prostate enlargement and prostate inflammation (prostatitis).', 'Prostate cancer', 'Prostate cancer is the second most common type of cancer in American males, after skin cancer, affecting around 1 in 7 men in the U.S. at some point during their lifetime.[1] Early-stage prostate cancer is typically asymptomatic and is usually detected during screening tests. When present, symptoms of more advanced prostate cancer may include:[2]', '\nFatigue\nLoss of appetite and weight loss\nInability to completely empty the bladder, i.e. urinary retention\nHematuria: blood in urine, which is visible to the eye or microscopically visible\nIncontinence and erectile dysfunction\n', 'Signs of late-stage prostate cancer may include pain in the lower back and/or bones, and lymphedema (localized swelling related to excess lymph-fluid-accumulation, due to blocked lymph drainage paths).', 'The survival chances for prostate cancer are more favourable than for many other types of cancer. This is because prostate cancer progresses comparatively slowly, so it is often possible to identify and treat the condition before it reaches a critical stage of advancement. In addition to prostate cancer, a prostatectomy may also be carried out to treat or manage other cancers that affect the pelvis, such as bladder cancer and rectal cancer.', 'Benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH)', 'Benign prostate hyperplasia is also referred to as prostate enlargement.[3]', 'Prostate enlargement is unrelated to cancer, and the likelihood of developing prostate cancer is not increased by having this condition. The enlargement of the prostate occurs as men age, and the prostate can grow to the extent that it begins to exert pressure on the urethra. This can cause discomfort and precipitate problems within the urinary system, including:[4]', '\nUrinary urgency: A strong urge or perceived need to urinate, which may be accompanied by pain and/or fear of urine leakage.\nUrinary frequency: The need to urinate frequently, usually in small quantities, during the night (nocturia) and day.\nHematuria: Blood may be present in urine. This is due to the fact that the enlargement of the prostate gland, that occurs during BPH, can increase the frequency of breakages in the blood vessels, particularly after physical activity. This often results in recurrent (repeating) episodes of hematuria, until BPH is treated.\n', 'Problems associated with BPH can sometimes be managed by taking medication which reduces the size of the prostate and helps to relax the muscles in and around the bladder. In some cases, however, a prostatectomy is necessary in order to relieve the symptoms.', 'Prostatitis', 'This is a condition in which the prostate gland becomes swollen and inflamed. Prostatitis often occurs as the result of a bacterial infection, caused by bacteria which enter via the bladder or urethra and then infect the prostate. The symptoms of prostatitis include difficulties urinating or starting to urinate, pain which occurs specifically when ejaculating and/or in the perineum (the area between the scrotum and the anus) and generalized pain in the genitals, buttocks and pelvis.', 'Prostatitis can often be managed or treated using medication to shrink the prostate gland, painkillers and anti-inflammatory medication called alpha-blockers. In chronic cases of prostatitis, where the symptoms cannot be managed or treated by medication, the prostate may be removed by a special type of prostatectomy called a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).', 'Types of prostatectomy', 'There are several different methods for performing a prostatectomy and several different types of prostatectomy, each appropriate to the treatment or management of different prostate-related conditions.', 'The main types of prostatectomy are:', '\nRadical prostatectomy\nNerve-sparing radical prostatectomy\nTransurethral resection of the prostate (TURP)\n', 'Before an individual undergoes the procedure, their urologist will discuss the intended route of surgery, and they will decide together on the best method. It is always important to find out whether or not the prostatectomy is intended to be nerve-sparing, an approach which ideally preserves erections and sexual function.', 'Radical prostatectomy', 'This type of operation is generally performed on people who are affected by prostate cancer. It involves removing the prostate gland in its entirety. The surgeon may also remove the surrounding tissues, lymph nodes (small pieces of tissue which should filter and clear liquid waste called lymph) and the seminal vesicles.', 'Nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy', 'Prostatectomies can compromise a man’s ability to produce or sustain an erection. A nerve-sparing prostatectomy is an innovation on the usual surgical procedure for a radical prostatectomy, in which the surgeon takes special care to spare the two cavernous nerve sheaths. These are clusters of nerves which lie to the sides of the prostate gland. Their function in healthy males is to produce erections.[5]', 'In nerve-sparing radical prostatectomies, the surgeon will stimulate the nerves electrically and measure erectile functionality using a machine called a penile plethysmograph[5] which measures the blood flow to the penis. This helps the surgeon to perform the surgery without cutting the nerves responsible for erectile function.', 'It is not always possible to carry out a nerve-sparing prostatectomy successfully. The surgeon’s technical skills and experience will greatly impact the chances of preserving erectile function. Also crucial to the success of this procedure are the age and previous erectile abilities of the male undergoing the procedure.', 'Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP)', 'TURP is predominantly carried out on people who are affected by benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), a non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate. By removing parts of the prostate that press on the urethra, TURP may reduce problems related to urination.', 'This operation is specifically designed to remove the inner part of the prostate which surrounds the urethra. Rather than cutting the skin to perform the operation, the urologist will insert an instrument called a resectoscope into the penis through the tip and extract the relevant tissue by burning it off with an electrical current or vaporizing it.', 'Unlike BPH, it is not possible to cure prostate cancer using the TURP procedure. However, the operation is sometimes recommended for men who are experiencing the advanced stages of prostate cancer.', 'Surgical methods for performing a prostatectomy', 'Traditionally, prostatectomies are carried out by open surgery, in which the surgeon makes a single, long incision in the skin and then removes the prostate and any other required surrounding tissues. However, due to technological advancements, it has become possible to carry out a prostatectomy using less invasive methods such as laparoscopic surgery (keyhole surgery).', 'An advantage of using the newer, less invasive surgical techniques is that they can often result in shorter postoperative (after surgery) recovery times. In cases, where only part of the prostate is to be removed, it is possible to perform the procedure without cutting into the surrounding skin at all. For example, a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) can be performed by inserting a thin tube called a resectoscope into the bladder through the urethra to remove the prostate tissue.', 'Open surgery', 'A radical prostatectomy can be performed using open surgery. This involves the surgeon making an incision into the lower belly in order to reach the prostate. This is called a retropublic approach. A retropubic radical prostatectomy is the most commonly performed type of prostatectomy.', 'It is also possible to perform a prostatectomy through an incision made into the perineum (area between the scrotum and the anus). This is called a perineal approach and is associated with a shorter recovery time than the retropubic approach.[6]', 'Laparoscopic prostatectomy (keyhole surgery)', 'This surgical technique is also called bandaid surgery or minimally invasive surgery (MIS). It is a modern method of performing operations through small incisions in the body, near the surgery site. One of the instruments will feature a video camera, which facilitates the surgeon seeing inside the body. Laparoscopic prostatectomies can usually be performed through incisions no bigger than 0.5 to 1.5 cm, and surgeons can perform this type of surgery by hand.', 'Robotic prostatectomy', 'Robotic prostatectomies are a type of laparoscopic prostatectomy. Rather than performing the operation by hand, a robotic arm is used to hold the surgical tools. This kind of prostatectomy ideally offers several advantages over the traditional laparoscopic prostatectomies, including:', '\nClinically superior results\nFewer complications\nFaster recovery\nMinimal scarring\n', 'Preparing for a prostatectomy', 'The time between a prostate condition being diagnosed and a prostatectomy being scheduled varies depending on the individual and the advancement of their specific condition. In cases where a prostatectomy is being carried out because of prostate cancer, there is often an interval of six or more weeks between the diagnosis – which involves taking a biopsy – and the scheduling of the operation. This is to allow any inflammation, that has occurred as a result of the biopsy, to heal.', 'These actions and forward-planning measures are helpful in preparing to undergo a prostatectomy:', 'Kegel exercises: Schedule an appointment to learn Kegel exercises before the operation. These strengthen the muscles around the bladder (pelvic floor muscles) and will assist the process of regaining normal urinary function after the catheter, which is regularly administered after surgery, is removed. They should be practiced before and after prostate surgery.', 'Hospital stay: A prostatectomy is an inpatient procedure that will require a hospital stay of two to three days, in general, after which it is possible to return home. Preparing for this, logistically and emotionally, will make this period run as smoothly as possible.', 'Time off work: Recovery time after a prostatectomy is variable, but it will usually be necessary to book up to several weeks off work. Some people return to non-physical work such as a desk job after only a few days. However, it can take up to six weeks or, in rare cases, even longer to recover sufficiently to return to work after open prostate surgery. The recovery time for returning to work after a laparoscopic prostatectomy is usually shorter, often between two and three weeks.', 'Avoid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Certain painkillers, such as aspirin and ibuprofen, may affect blood clotting. Using them before surgery can result in excessive bleeding. If needed, acetaminophen (Tylenol or Paracetamol) may be suitable to prevent minor aches and pains. However, no painkiller products should be used in the period before surgery, without first consulting a doctor to check that they are suitable.', 'These medicines and dietary modifications are helpful preparations for the day before the surgery is due to take place:', 'Bowel preparation: In order for the surgery to be performed properly, it is vital that the bowel is empty and clean. The doctor will prescribe a bowel preparation to be taken the day before the surgery in order to help remove waste from the area.', 'Avoid solid food: To prevent the body from creating more feces and compromising the cleanliness of the bowel, it is important to avoid solid food for the day before the surgery and ingest only clear liquids.', 'Avoid eating or drinking on the day of the surgery: Because general anaesthetic will be used, it is important to avoid ingesting anything before the surgery takes place. People are usually recommended to avoid eating after midnight the night before the surgery takes place, but, in each case, always follow the specific guidelines given by the surgeon or anesthesiologist.', 'During the procedure', 'Prostatectomies, depending on the type itself, usually take about one or two, and, in rarer cases, for more complicated open radical prostatectomies, three hours for the urologist to perform, with the whole surgical procedure, including sedation and waking up, usually lasting two to four hours in total.', 'Immediately after the surgery, a temporary subrapubic catheter (a thin tube) is inserted through the penis or, alternatively, through an incision in the abdomen, in order to streamline the process of urination during recovery. The catheter serves to prevent urine coming into contact with the healing area and often stays in place for about 7 days, but this may also vary greatly, depending on the procedure performed or the patient’s specific recovery progress.', 'Postoperative care and recovery', 'The duration of time people stay in hospital after their prostatectomy varies, though it will usually be between two and three days. It is possible, particularly if the procedure was a laparoscopic prostatectomy, to recover sufficiently to return to work after a period of two to three weeks. Nearly everybody who undergoes a prostatectomy recovers sufficiently to return to work after six weeks.', 'As soon as the operation is complete, and while the person undergoing the procedure is still in the operating room, a temporary suprapubic catheter will be inserted to assist them in urinating during the immediate recovery process. A suprapubic catheter is a hollow, flexible tube which is inserted into the bladder through an incision in the stomach above the navel (tummy button). The catheter is left in place for one or two weeks and helps drain the urine from the bladder whilst the area, which has undergone surgery, is healing. In some cases, instead of the suprapubic catheter, a transurethral catheter leading from the exit of the urethra at the tip of the penis to the bladder may be inserted.', 'People who have undergone a prostatectomy should expect to see a small amount of postoperative bleeding from the tip of the penis after the catheter has been removed; this is during urination in the days after the surgery and lasts for up to a maximum of 6 weeks after surgery. While the catheter is still in place, some blood and/or blood-like debris are likely to be visible in the urine collection system; this is normal, especially during the first few days after surgery.', 'In addition to the catheter, a range of devices and techniques are recommended to promote healing during the immediate recovery period:', 'Donut cushion: Postoperative pain when sitting can be avoided by using a circular cushion with a hole in the middle, and which is called a donut cushion; this allows the wearer to sit down without putting pressure on the surgery site.', 'Drinking plenty of water: This will help ensure that the urinary system functions as healthily as possible while it is recovering from surgery and will also keep the body hydrated. Staying hydrated is also necessary, because the affected person will be using stool softener in the postoperative period to avoid constipation.', 'Kegel exercises: These should be practiced before and after the operation to keep the pelvic floor muscles, which control the bladder and urine flow, operational as directed by a doctor. The three areas which are strengthened by Kegel exercises are the bladder which holds the urine, the pubococcygeus muscle which supports the bladder and rectum, and the sphincter urethrae, which helps open and close the urethra. Kegel exercises can help a person to recover from the incontinence caused by undergoing a prostatectomy, which is temporary in most cases.', 'Limiting other physical activity: Other than the Kegel exercises, it is advisable to limit other physical exercise and heavy lifting during the recovery period. Walking around gently at intervals during the day is recommended, however, to prevent blood clots forming in the groin and legs.', 'Sexual activity: Urologists advise people who have undergone a prostatectomy to explore the resumption of sexual activity as soon as they feel ready. Even if it is not immediately possible to produce an erection sufficient for performing full sexual intercourse, stimulating the area will help the nerves and muscles involved in producing an erection become used to doing so. Men who have had a successful nerve-sparing prostatectomy tend to recover their erectile abilities quickly. For men who have had a non-nerve-sparing or unsuccessful nerve-sparing prostatectomy, the process of regaining erectile function can take longer. Medications and/or devices can be prescribed in these cases. In the rare event of a prostatectomy resulting in chronic impotence, surgical procedures such as the insertion of penile implants can help.', 'Pain medication: Most people will experience some pain in and around the area which has undergone surgery, as well as some pain related to wearing the catheter. The doctor will prescribe suitable painkillers and give advice on how frequently to redose.', 'Stool softeners: It is normal to be affected by constipation after undergoing surgery. The doctor will prescribe a suitable stool softener to help maintain healthy bowel function.', 'Urination and incontinence in the postoperative period', 'People who have undergone a prostatectomy will be taught how to operate the catheter before they leave hospital after the operation. The operation of most catheters is relatively similar and involves collecting the urine in a drainage bag, which can then be emptied into the lavatory. The drainage bag must be changed at appropriate intervals.', 'All men normally experience some level of incontinence (leakage of urine) after the catheter has been removed, particularly after involuntary bodily actions such as sneezing or laughing. It is also common to experience sudden impulses to urinate while the catheter is in place. This is called a bladder spasm. Bladder spasms should ideally not be particularly painful or occur very often. Therefore, it is wise to consult the doctor if they occur frequently enough to be bothersome or are accompanied by acute pain.', 'For most men, urinary problems are temporary and are effectively resolved by practicing pelvic floor and Kegel exercises regularly, as recommended by the doctor. Pads should be worn whilst urinary leakage is occurring and changed throughout the day as needed.', 'Very rarely, men who have undergone a prostatectomy develop a permanent kind of urinary incontinence called chronic urinary incontinence. If urinary incontinence remains a problem after the catheter has been removed, further surgical procedures will be considered to treat the incontinence. For example, the insertion of an artificial urinary sphincter, a device which regulates the release of urine from the bladder, may need to be considered as an option.', 'Penile rehabilitation (regaining erectile function)', 'All prostate surgery procedures disrupt the nerves and blood vessels that control the way erections form. For this reason, all prostatectomies will compromise erectile function, at least initially. Up to 50 percent of men who have had a successful nerve-sparing procedure, i.e. the nerves were left untouched as planned during the procedure, regain their pre-prostatectomy (before surgery) erectile functionality within one year. For men, who have not had nerve-sparing procedures, it is still possible to recover most or the entire extent of their pre-treatment erectile capability.', 'Prostate surgery can alter the sensation of the male orgasm. In some men, the orgasm ceases to be as intensely pleasurable or ceases to be pleasurable at all. This change in sensation is principally caused by the fact that, in radical prostatectomies, both the glands which make seminal fluid and the vas deferens (the sperm ducts) are no longer operational, so the male orgasm must occur without the ejaculation of semen. Sometimes, especially common after TURP surgery, the semen may still be ejected,  will not, however, leave the body, but be transported into the bladder; this is called retrograde ejaculation.', 'Occasionally, men who have undergone a prostatectomy report experiencing pain when orgasming after they have recovered. It is possible for the pain – which usually affects the perineum and pelvis – to occur either occasionally, at regular intervals or every time the affected person engages in sexual intercourse. The incomplete removal of the seminal vesicles during the prostatectomy procedure is thought to be a principal cause of postoperative pain on orgasming.[7]', 'Factors, which affect the chances of regaining one’s erectile functionality after the procedure, include:', '\nThe skill of the urologist: The greater their experience and success rate at preserving sexual function, the more likely a given procedure is to conclude with this outcome.\nAge: Younger men are more likely than older men to keep or regain their erectile abilities.\nPrevious sexual profile: The greater a man’s virility and ability to produce erections before the procedure, the more likely he is to keep or regain it after the procedure.\n', 'Doctors will usually encourage postoperative patients to resume sexual activity as soon as the catheter is removed in order to preserve their penile function. The sooner after surgery a man begins exploring his erectile abilities, the more likely he is to regain most or all of his normal sexual functionality. This process is called penile rehabilitation.[8]', 'The success of penile rehabilitation depends foremost on whether or not a man has undergone a nerve-sparing prostatectomy. Non nerve-sparing prostatectomies and unsuccessful nerve-sparing prostatectomies damage the two bundles of nerves associated with producing erections.', 'If both bundles of nerves are sufficiently damaged, it may no longer be possible for a man to have spontaneous erections without the aid of devices or medications that assist the bodily process in cases when it can no longer happen naturally. However, in cases where spontaneous erections are no longer possible, there are several possible treatment options which may help with overcoming erectile dysfunction after a prostatectomy.', 'Treatment options for  erectile dysfunction after prostatectomy include:', 'Topical medication', 'The best medication for assisting erectile function is Alprostadil, a man-made version of prostaglandin E1, a substance naturally made in the body to help produce erections. Five to ten minutes before sexual activity takes place, this medication can be applied by injection (brand name Caverject) into a certain part of the penis, as a suppository into the tip of the penis (brand name MUSE), or applied as a cream.', 'Alprostadil has significantly fewer and less severe side effects than most oral medications which can be used to treat erectile dysfunction. It works by widening the blood vessels and increasing the blood flow to the penis, causing an erection. If side effects occur, these are usually non-serious and are limited to prolonged erections, pain and dizziness. Another advantage of Alprostadil is that the dosage can be adjusted to to determine the duration of an erection.', 'The cream version of alprostadil ‒ marketed as Vitaros ‒ is the newest form of this medication.[9] It comes in a single-use container with a plunger, barrel and protective cap, containing either 200 or 300 micrograms of alprostadil in 100 mg of cream.[10] The appropriate dose strength for each person is decided in consultation with their doctor.', 'Storage and application guidelines for Vitaros include:[11]', '\nVitaros should be stored in the fridge, but can be taken out before use in order to reach room temperature, for ease of application. If it is taken directly out of the fridge, it may need to be warmed up for use by massaging the tube in one’s hands.\nIt is best to urinate before applying Vitaros. Urination after application will result in cream being expelled from the urethra, lessening its erectile effects.\nEach tube of Vitaros contains the right amount of medication for a single dose, which should be applied, with clean hands and in full to the penis, by injecting it into the urethra, using the single-use applicator pump provided. The penis should then be kept upright for 30 seconds so that the cream can be absorbed. Any leftover cream can be rubbed in around the tip of the penis. Hands should be washed after application.\nVitaros will usually take effect in 5-30 minutes after application. It is not an aphrodisiac, and sexual stimulation will therefore be necessary to achieve an erection. For most people, the effects last between one and two hours. A full, warm sensation in the penis is not a cause for concern, and may remain for several hours after use.\n', 'Vitaros should not be used more than once within any 24 hour period. A person should not exceed three doses in a week.[11]', 'Oral medication', 'If only one set of the nerve bundles that control erections has been damaged, it is possible to stimulate erections using pharmaceuticals such as sildenafil, commonly known as Viagra, vardenafil and tadalafil. These medications are taken orally, and they work by counteracting Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5), a chemical naturally occurring in the body, thereby increasing blood flow to the penis during sexual stimulation.', 'PDE5 inhibitors are associated with several side effects including headaches, a runny nose, hot flushes, an upset stomach and light sensitivity. In some cases, they can cause more severe and permanent vision problems, such as blindness.', 'These medications are known to react with nitrate-containing drugs used to treat heart disease, so it is important to discuss possible interactions with the doctor in cases where PDE5 inhibitors may be taken in combination with other medications, especially heart medications.', 'Vacuum devices', 'These are mechanical pumps which cause an erection by drawing blood into the penis when the air is sucked out of the pump, after it has been placed over the penis. Erections created with the use of a vacuum device require a band to be applied to the base of the penis to trap the blood for the duration of the intercouse. The band can then be removed afterwards.', 'Implants', 'For people for whom no other treatments for post-prostatectomy erectile dysfunction are effective, implants may help. These can be surgically inserted into the penis, which requires an operation.', 'Risks and side-effects', 'As with any major surgical procedure, a prostatectomy carries certain risks and possible side effects. These include problems that can occur immediately after the surgery, such as an allergic reaction to substances in the anaesthetic medication, as well as problems which can occur later on. For instance, the formation of blood clots or infections developing near the surgery site.', 'Complications which can arise from the procedure can include:', 'Incontinence', 'All prostatectomies disrupt the normal flow of urine from the bladder and out of the penis through the urethra. For this reason, everybody who undergoes a prostatectomy will experience a period when they have difficulties controlling the speed and flow of their urination in the immediate aftermath of the procedure.', 'Most men regain their bladder control after several weeks or months after the catheter is removed, particularly in cases when there are no other complications and Kegel exercises are practiced as recommended. Some people do not recover their bladder control, this is called continuous incontinence, which may be treated with further surgery and/or by using devices to regulate the flow of urine and control the bladder, such as an artificial sphincter.', 'Bleeding after the surgery', 'Because all prostatectomies involve cutting internal tissue, and, in most cases, also external tissue, there is the potential for problematic bleeding to occur after the procedure has been performed. It is important to consult the doctor as soon as possible if  bleeding, especially fresh blood occurs beyond the initial recovery period (see passage above) or if the bleeding is very strong in the initial period. Either circumstance may indicate a hemorrhage, and should therefore should be investigated.[12]', 'If bleeding does continue after the catheter is removed, then it might be a sign of internal bleeding after surgery, and medical attention should be sought immediately.', 'Blood clots', 'Blood clots that develop after prostate surgery tend to form in the legs or less commonly the groin area. Loose blood clots can then cause pulmonary embolism, a life-threatening condition in which the blood clot travels to the lungs and causes a blockage in the pulmonary artery, the blood vessel which carries the blood from the heart to the lungs. Walking around and consistently practicing pelvic floor exercises in the initial recovery period is an effective way to prevent clots from forming.', 'Damage to nearby organs', 'This can occur in the event of a surgical error. Urologists are careful to perform the procedure as precisely as possible so as to minimise the risk of causing damage to the surrounding area. However, in rare cases, injury to the surrounding tissue and organs can still be sustained.', 'Adverse reactions to the anesthesia', 'If a person has a history of swelling of the face or generalised itching, it is important to inform the anaesthetist before the procedure because,  although allergic reactions to anaesthesia can be mild, involving only wheezing or some skin irritation, it is also possible to experience an anaphylactic response which can be life-threatening.', 'Somebody suffering from an allergic reaction to an anaesthetic may display signs like breathing difficulties, low blood pressure, rashes, hives and swollen skin around the eyes or mouth and throat. It is possible to perform tests prior to the surgery to identify which chemicals trigger an allergic reaction and if necessary an appropriate alternative anaesthetic solution can then be chosen.[13]', 'Other adverse reactions, such a muscle soreness, a sore throat from the breathing tube or nausea and vomiting after the surgery are a lot more common than allergic reactions. Around 10 percent of people will experience some kind of adverse reaction to anaesthetic drugs[14], and anaesthetists are trained to recognise and treat reactions as and when they occur during or after surgery.', 'Infections at the surgery site', 'The parts of the body which are most likely to be infected after surgery are located in the abdomen (the belly). Infections after prostate surgery are usually due to the intestine being injured during surgery, which is more common in cases where the prostatectomy has been carried out by keyhole surgery than when an open approach has been used.', 'Lower-body lymphedema', 'This is a rare complication of removing the lymph nodes around the prostate during prostate surgery. Removing any of the body’s lymph nodes can affect the lymphatic system. Functioning normally, the lymph nodes act as a drain for lymph fluid which circulates around the body. When this protein-rich fluid cannot drain out through the lymph nodes, it can build up and stagnate in the area of the body where the lymph nodes were removed, and infection-causing bacteria can develop.[15]', 'Common symptoms of lymphedema after prostatectomy include:[15][16]', '\nHeaviness and achiness in the genital area or legs\nReddening of the skin in the genital area or legs\nChanges in the size and shape of the legs\nSwollen skin\nReduced flexibility\n', 'Always consult a doctor if lymphedema is suspected. If lymphedema is left untreated, the growing pool of undrained lymph can spread to surrounding areas of the body, such as the back and legs.[17] Treatment for lymphedema focuses on redistributing this buildup of lymph within the body, so that it can be drained by other, functioning, lymph nodes. This may involve:[18]', '\nApplying a compression system, such as a special bandage, to the affected area\nManual lymph drainage, a specific type of massage performed by a doctor or occupational therapist\nStretching exercises\nDeep breathing exercises\nA manual pump to use at home\n', 'Pelvic lymphocele', 'Pelvic lymphocele is a possible complication of prostate surgery, most commonly associated with undergoing a radical prostatectomy. A lymphocele occurs when the local lymphatic system is compromised due to surgery as a result of which, a buildup of lymph drains into a nearby cavity, rather than being drained from the area where the lymph nodes were removed.[19]', 'When lymphocele occurs after prostate surgery, the buildup of lymph is usually found in the retroperitoneal space, i.e. behind the membrane that lines the abdominal cavity and covers the abdominal organs. Lymphocele can be symptomless, and can resolve spontaneously, without the need for treatment.', 'When symptoms of lymphocele do occur, they may include:', '\nAbdominal pain\nA sensation of fullness\nReddened or swollen skin\nConstipation\nUrinary urgency or the need to urinate frequently\nEdema (swelling) of the genitals and/or legs\n', 'Seek prompt medical attention if symptoms of lymphocele are present. The presence of symptoms indicates that the lymphocele has grown to a size, at which treatment will be required in order to remove it. Left untreated, lymphocele can cause other problems to develop, including obstruction of the urinary tract, obstruction of the blood flow to the surgery site and/or compression of nearby blood vessels, which will slow down the post-surgical healing process.', 'In addition to a physical examination, an ultrasound or CT scan may be carried out in order to diagnose lymphocele. Treatment for symptomatic lymphocele may involve:[20]', 'Marsupialization: This is a surgical technique which involves cutting a slit into the area occupied by the lymphocele and suturing it into an open position, creating a pouch shape and thereby allowing the buildup of lymph to drain freely out of the previously enclosed space. It is usually carried out as an outpatient procedure. Laparoscopic marsupialization has recently become the first line treatment for pelvic lymphocele, although it is also possible to perform marsupialization via open surgery. In laparoscopic marsupialization, a very small incision is made in the skin near the lymphocele; marsupialization can then be carried out robotically, using image guidance.[21]', 'Percutaneous drainage: This procedure is carried out under local anesthetic and takes around one hour to perform. A small incision will be made in the skin near the site of the lymphocele. Doctors will use image guidance to insert a needle attached to a catheter into the lymphocele, and the fluid will then be drained out of the body, via the catheter, into a drainage bag.[22]', 'Inguinal hernia', 'Performing surgery other than TURP on the prostate weakens the layers of pelvic tissue and muscle tissue of the lower belly where the incision was made. This can cause internal parts of the body, such as parts of the intestine, to gravitate from their normal location, causing pain and a distinctive bulge to form in the groin area. Men are ten times more likely to experience an inguinal hernia than women[23], and their chances of developing the condition later on are significantly increased by having undergone an open surgery prostatectomy.', 'Other complications', ""Good to know: An additional, less common, complication of prostate surgery is Peyronie's disease. This condition causes a shortening and curvature of the penis and primarily affects men in their fifth or sixth decade of life. Peyronie’s disease shares this characteristic with most prostate-related conditions that require a prostatectomy, but there is little evidence to support or refute the idea that they are necessarily linked.[24]"", 'However, the shortening of the urethra, that can occur as a result of a prostatectomy, can cause the penis to shorten and curve in a manner that is hard to distinguish or is even indistinguishable from the curvature caused by Peyronie’s disease.', 'Prostatectomy FAQs', 'Q: Can a prostatectomy cause a change in penis length?\nA: Yes. It is very common for the penis length to decrease after prostate surgery, due to the fact that a portion of the urethra is often removed with the prostate. Radical prostatectomies generally cause the greatest decrease in penis length. In most cases, the length of the penis is most diminished immediately after the procedure and the difference between its postoperative length and original length decreases as the person recovers.[25]', 'Q: Can a prostatectomy cause loss of fertility?\nA: Radical prostatectomies are the type most commonly associated with a loss of fertility. This is because they involve cutting and/or removing the vas deferens, meaning that the sperm no longer have a conduit to travel from the testicles and out of the body in seminal fluid. A man, who has had a radical prostatectomy, can no longer father a child naturally, but can choose to save (bank) his sperm for future use before the operation.[26] It is important to talk to the doctor before the procedure is carried out and make arrangements if this is needed.', 'Q: Is it possible to drive a car during the recovery period from a prostatectomy?\nA: One should avoid driving completely whilst the catheter is in place. After the catheter is removed, it is nevertheless advisable to avoid certain activities such as driving for two to four weeks after the operation and to confirm with one’s doctor that one is fit to resume them on a follow-up visit.', 'Q: What precautions should I take to keep clean and promote healing while the temporary catheter is in place and after its removal?\nA: The subrapubic or transurethral cathether is a thin, flexible tube; a temporary device which is inserted after prostate surgery in order to streamline urination during recovery. It is usually worn for around one or two weeks, during which time a person should keep the surrounding area as clean and dry as possible. This can be achieved by washing the rest of the body with a sponge or flannel, rather than bathing or showering fully. Drinking plenty of water is advised in order to keep the urinary system functioning normally.', 'It is not unusual to experience some pain and/or irritation in the urethral area due to the presence of a transurethral catheter or some discomfort in the lower belly area if a suprapubic catheter is used. Suitable painkillers to take during the recovery process will be recommended by one’s doctor, and any irritation should clear up on its own once the catheter is removed. Some people may experience temporary urinary incontinence after the removal of the catheter. If this occurs, urinary pads should be worn until normal urinary function is restored.', '', ""\n\n“Key Statistics for Prostate Cancer.” American Cancer Society. 2017. ↩\n\n“Prostate cancer, subdivision: clinical features.” Amboss. 09 March 2018.

Some people may have a predisposition to such inflammation.[17]', 'Obesity', 'Research has found that obesity may have an impact on the development of the condition.[18][19] It is not known why this is, but one reason postulated is that fat cells release proteins called cytokines, which create inflammation throughout the body.[20]', 'Good to know: Obesity may also have a negative impact on the effectiveness of rheumatoid arthritis treatment, particularly with some disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).[21] It can also lead to earlier deterioration of the main joints, such as the knees, due to increased pressure.', 'Prevention', 'While there is no known way to prevent the onset of rheumatoid arthritis, there are a few known ways in which a person can reduce the risk. These include:', '\nQuitting tobacco smoking\nBeing physically active and eating a healthy diet\nTaking steps to maintain a healthy weight\n', 'It is also important to see a doctor as soon as symptoms develop, as early treatment can greatly minimize the rheumatoid arthritis progression, as well as any permanent damage caused by flare-ups.', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is generally confirmed after referral to a rheumatologist, a type of doctor specializing in inflammation and pain in the joints, muscles, or fibrous tissues.', 'RA can take a long time to diagnose as its early onset can be subtle and present similarly to other, less long-term conditions, such as flu, also known as influenza. It also often presents similarly to other types of arthritis, such as reactive arthritis.', 'Unlike other types of arthritis, there is no specific test for rheumatoid arthritis . Instead, a rheumatologist relies on gathering information to rule out other conditions and identify the cause of a person’s symptoms. Diagnosis may be made from a combination of reported medical history and symptoms, a physical examination, laboratory tests and medical imaging.', 'Interview and physical exam', 'It is important that a person describe any joint pain and other symptoms, as well as how long they have been going on for.', 'A doctor will look for signs of rheumatoid arthritis, such as swollen, tender, warm joints with painful or limited movement, and rheumatoid nodules. They may also ask for family medical history; if another member of their family has the disease, then a person has a higher risk of having the condition themselves.', 'Laboratory tests', 'If a doctor suspects rheumatoid arthritis, one or more tests may be done to help make a diagnosis. These include:[22]', 'Testing for rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies: RF is a protein that attacks healthy tissues. If it is present, there is about an 80 percent chance that a person has or may develop rheumatoid arthritis or another inflammatory disease. Anti-CCP antibodies indicate that a person is very likely to develop RA.', 'Measuring inflammatory markers: Abnormally high levels of certain markers in the blood would support a diagnosis that symptoms are caused by an inflammatory condition such as rheumatoid arthritis. Inflammatory markers which may be detected by a blood test include:', '\nTumor necrosis factor-alpha\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR or sed rate)\nC-reactive protein (CRP)\n', 'Good to know: The presence of anti-CCP antibodies in the blood indicates that a person with RA may be more likely to develop severe symptoms, requiring more intensive treatment.', 'Medical imaging', 'A doctor may also recommend an X-ray, ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the affected joint. This can help to rule out other conditions that present with similar symptoms, such as gout. However, at an early stage of rheumatoid arthritis, any characteristic damage caused by the condition may not be apparent.[22]', 'FAQs', 'Q: Osteoarthritis vs. rheumatoid arthritis - what is the difference?\nA: Both rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA) are types of chronic, untreatable arthritis which may be confused due to having the similar symptom of joint pain and inflammation. However, they have different causes. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease with a typically sudden onset of symptoms and occurs in episodes of inflammation on symmetrical joints of the body. OA is a “wear and tear” condition associated with factors such as older age, injury or obesity. It develops slowly, caused by continuous use of particular joints. RA tends to involve additional symptoms such as fever and fatigue, whereas OA only affects the joints. Rheumatoid arthritis onset tends to occur from 30 to 60 years old, while OA tends to develop later in life.[23]', 'Q: Is rheumatoid arthritis hereditary?\nA: One’s genetics can increase the chances of developing the condition, and a number of genetic markers have been identified that increase this risk. However, not everyone with RA has these, nor does everyone who has such genetic markers develop RA. Many genetic and environmental factors appear to be involved in whether a person develops rheumatoid arthritis.[24]', 'Other names for rheumatoid arthritis', '\nRA\nInflammatory arthritis (This is a group of conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis and [systemic lupus erythematosus,]/(conditions/systemic-lupus-erythematosus/) also known as lupus, among others)\n', '', '\n\nCDC.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can usually be effectively managed with early, appropriate treatment. There is currently no rheumatoid arthritis cure, and it is usually a chronic condition requiring lifelong treatment.', 'The main aims of treatment for RA are:[5][6]', '\nTo prevent joint damage\nTo minimize pain and other symptoms, and maintain quality of life\nTo prevent the development of associated conditions such as osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease\n', 'There are three main aspects of rheumatoid arthritis treatment:', '\nMedication\nPhysical therapy\nIn some cases, surgery\n', 'Medications', 'Rheumatoid arthritis is usually treated with a combination of medications. The five main types of rheumatoid arthritis drugs used are:[6]', 'Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): These offer pain relief and reduce minor inflammation, though they do not reduce the long-term damaging effects of RA.', 'Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs): These work by blocking the effects of chemicals released by the immune system, which can damage nearby bones, tendons, ligaments and cartilage.', 'Biologic agents: Also known as biologic response modifiers, these are a newer class of DMARDs. Biologic DMARDs are most effective when paired with a nonbiologic DMARD.', 'Steroids: These quickly improve symptoms such as joint pain, stiffness and swelling and are generally recommended where rheumatoid arthritis severely limits a person’s ability to function normally, until slower acting joint damage-preventing DMARDs begin to work.', 'Painkillers: These offer pain relief but have no effect on inflammation, and may be recommended in the case of a badly damaged joint that cannot be replaced with surgery.', 'Physical therapy', 'People with rheumatoid arthritis often become inactive due to joint pain and stiffness. However, inactivity can lead to inflexibility, muscle and tendon shortening, and muscle weakness. In turn, weakness further increases fatigue and decreases stability of the joints.', 'A physiotherapist can recommend safe exercises to strengthen muscles, restore joint range-of-motion joints and ease symptoms.', 'An occupational therapist may recommend ways to approach day-to-day activities without putting too much strain on the joints. They may also recommend splints if needed for hand and wrist support.', 'A podiatrist may work with a person on ways to ease problems with the feet and ankles, such as by using appropriate footwear.', 'Surgery', 'Occasionally, surgery is needed to treat joints affected by rheumatoid arthritis. These can be minor surgeries, such as to release a nerve or tendon or more major surgeries such as hip, knee, shoulder and elbow replacements.', 'Diet', 'There are no clear-cut answers as to what diet to follow with rheumatoid arthritis, as there is a lot of conflicting evidence, and different diets may affect people in different ways. However, it is generally recommended that a person eat:[7][8]', '\nA balanced and varied diet with plenty of fruit, vegetables, fish, pulses, nuts and olive oil to get all the vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and other nutrients you need\nOmega-3 fatty acid-rich food regularly, such as oily fish, seaweed and walnuts\nCalcium-rich food, such as dairy products and calcium-enriched non-dairy products\nVitamin-D-rich food, such as eggs\nIron-rich food, such as dark green vegetables\n', 'Weight loss may be recommended for overweight people to reduce stress on affected joints. However, sometimes people with rheumatoid arthritis lose their appetite, and dietary therapy may be recommended to help ensure that an adequate amount of calories and nutrients are consumed.', 'Natural treatment', 'Natural treatments have not conclusively been shown to stop or slow rheumatoid arthritis progression, but may help with pain relief when used in conjunction with prescribed rheumatoid arthritis medications.', 'Supplements for rheumatoid arthritis containing gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) have been shown to modestly improve joint pain, stiffness and grip strength.[9] This includes evening primrose oil or borage oil, especially when combined with fish oil, which reduces the synthesis of inflammatory by-products of GLA.[10]', 'Calcium and vitamin D supplements may be recommended if not enough is consumed through diet. These can help to minimize bone loss, which is associated with steroid therapy.[6]', 'Good to know: rheumatoid arthritis should never be treated exclusively with natural supplements or without seeing a doctor.']"
['Rickets'],"['Rickets is a condition which affects the development of bones in children. Caused in most cases by a deficiency of vitamin D and subsequently also calcium, the condition can lead to the bones becoming soft and weak. This process can ultimately lead to bone deformity if left untreated.', 'Rickets is most common in children, but its equivalent can also occur in adults. In such cases, the condition is known as osteomalacia or “soft bones”.', 'Treating rickets generally involves following a nutritionally-balanced diet and/or taking vitamin supplements. In most cases, the condition can be treated successfully.[1]']","['Symptoms of rickets may include:[2][3]', '\nGrowth and development issues: Children may be shorter than average due to bone development problems.\nPain: Bones may become sore or painful, especially when pressure is applied. This may lead to a child being reluctant to walk or get up from a sitting position, and they may appear to walk abnormally.\nBrittle bones: Bones may become weaker than normal, leading to an increased likelihood of fracturing and breaking.\nDental issues: May include weak tooth enamel, slow development of teeth and an increased likelihood of cavities.\nDeformities: The ankles, wrists and knees may become thicker than normal. Bowed legs, a softening of the skull and – less commonly – a bending of the spine may also occur.\n', 'If any of these symptoms are present, medical attention should be sought.', 'Many of the same symptoms may also occur in adults experiencing osteomalacia. However, adults tend to report more bone pain and tenderness than children with rickets.']","['Rickets can be caused by a variety of factors, including:', '\nVitamin D and/or calcium deficiency\nGenetics\nUnderlying conditions\n', 'Vitamin D and calcium deficiency', 'A deficiency of vitamin D and/or calcium is by far the most common cause of rickets in children. The majority of children will receive sufficient amounts of calcium through their diet. However, it is rare for one’s diet to contain sufficient quantities of vitamin D, and many people choose to use a vitamin D supplement in order to ensure that they get the required amount.', 'Foodstuffs containing vitamin D and calcium include:[4]', '\nVitamin D: Small quantities of vitamin D are found in oily fish, e.g. salmon, eggs, some dairy products like cheese and some cereals.\nCalcium: Found in dairy products such as cheese, milk and yoghurt, as well as green vegetables such as kale and broccoli.\n', 'Vitamin D and calcium supplements are widely available. Consulting a physician when choosing a vitamin supplement is recommended, in order to ensure that it is appropriate for the individual.', 'Factors that make children more likely to develop rickets related to vitamin D or calcium deficiency include:[5]', '\nDark skin: Dark skin contains more melanin than light skin, increasing the amount of UV-B light/sun exposure needed to produce vitamin D.\nLack of exposure to sun: Children who spend the majority of their time indoors, or lack exposure to sunlight for any other reason, are less likely to produce a sufficient amount of vitamin D. Additionally, if children live in countries that are far away from the equator and/or in the northern hemisphere, even if they spend plenty of time outdoors, the sunlight may not be strong enough to effectively stimulate vitamin D production.\nPre-existing conditions: Certain conditions – such as liver disease, kidney disease and celiac disease – can affect the way the body produces and controls vitamin D.\nBreastfeeding: Children who are exclusively breastfed and have dark skin and/or a mother who is lacking in vitamin D have a higher chance of developing rickets.\n', 'Genetics', 'In rare cases, rickets can run in families.', 'The most common form is hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets, which results from mutations in several genes. This condition renders the kidneys unable to retain phosphate, leading to a deficiency of this important chemical. Phosphate plays a central role in bone formation and growth.[6][7]', 'Underlying conditions', 'In rare cases, rickets can develop as a result of underlying conditions (some of which are hereditary) of the liver, kidneys or intestines. These conditions typically affect the way the body produces, absorbs and retains minerals and vitamins, and may lead to deficiencies. These include phosphate and calcium deficiencies, which can result in rickets if left untreated.[7]']","['The necessary treatment route for rickets depends on the condition’s underlying cause.', 'When rickets is caused by a deficiency of vitamin D or calcium, increasing the intake of each is the primary treatment option. Methods of doing this include:[8]', '\nConsuming more food rich in vitamin D and calcium, such as oily fish, cereals and eggs for vitamin D, and green leafy vegetables and dairy products for calcium.\nTaking supplements containing vitamin D and calcium.\nReceiving a vitamin D injection (usually administered yearly and, in most cases, only if other options are unavailable).\nIncreasing one’s exposure to sunlight.\n', 'Treatment for genetic forms of rickets will depend on the type. Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets (the most common genetic form) typically requires phosphate and vitamin D supplements.', 'Supplement side-effects', 'It is rare for vitamin D or calcium supplements to cause any side-effects.

['Rosacea'],"['Rosacea is a skin condition that affects the face. It is not contagious, but it is very common: in the United Kingdom, for example, about one in 10 adults are affected,[1] and, according to recent statistics, over 16 million Americans.[2]', 'Rosacea is not a type of acne, and the term “acne rosacea” is misleading. However, acne and rosacea may occur together. Unlike acne, rosacea is more common among older people, particularly those aged between 40 and 60 years of age.[3] It is somewhat more common among women than men, but tends to be more severe in men.[4] Also, unlike acne, rosacea does not cause scarring.[3]', 'Rosacea usually affects the skin of the face, particularly the nose, cheeks and forehead.[1] In some cases, it can affect the skin of the neck, chest and ears, and rarely, it can affect the eye. Rosacea is not always itchy or painful, but may cause a stinging or burning sensation. It can also be unsightly and distressing to those affected by it.[1]', 'Its most prominent symptoms are facial redness and flushing. A rare effect of rosacea is rhinophyma, a thickening of the skin on and around the nose that leads to a characteristic red and bumpy appearance.[1] This is usually found in older male sufferers.', 'Types of rosacea', 'There are several subtypes of rosacea:[5][6]', '\nErythromatotelangiectactic, characterized by skin redness and visible small blood vessels.\nPapulopustular, characterized by papules (small pimples) and pustules (small pimples containing pus).\nPhymatous (both mild and severe subtypes), marked by thickened skin.\nOcular, affecting the eyes.\n', 'Treatment depends on which sort of rosacea is present. People suspected of having rosacea, particularly those who suffer from ocular rosacea or from symptoms that are resistant to treatment, should generally be treated by a specialist such as a dermatologist or ophthalmologist.']","['Because rosacea is common, most competent medical practitioners will be able to diagnose it based on the patient’s history and the appearance of their skin. In some cases, doctors may recommend that blood tests are done, in order to rule out other conditions that cause skin redness, such as systemic lupus erythematosus.[1]', 'The symptoms of rosacea are distinctive. They include:[1][3][4]', '\nA tendency to blush or flush easily, leading to transient redness, also known as erythema\nDilated and visible blood vessels under the surface of the skin, known as telangiectasia\nRed bumps, known as papules, and pustules, slightly resembling mild acne\nThickened skin, known as phymatous changes\nEye problems, such as sore eyelids and dry eyes\n', 'The symptoms of rosacea tend to begin mildly, but worsen with time. People affected will first notice an increased tendency to blush or flush, with skin redness taking longer and longer to fade. Over time, the redness will become permanent. The intensity of facial flushing can be affected by emotion, hydration, chemicals and stress.[7]', 'In some cases of rosacea, small blood vessels under the skin become more prominent. Itching is sometimes present, and redness is often accompanied by a burning sensation. Affected people may find that their skin is hot to the touch during a flushing episode.', 'Symptoms of ocular rosacea', 'Ocular rosacea is a complication of the condition. Symptoms include:[3][5][8]', '\nItchy, burning or stinging eyes.\nDry, scratchy eyes.\nA feeling of grit or a foreign body in the eye.\nPhotosensitivity (sensitivity to light).\nInflammation of the eyelid (blepharitis), styes, or cysts.\nChalazions, which are small, usually painless lumps on the eyelid, caused by blocked oil or meibomian glands. These are not to be confused with styes, which result from infection. Styes are painful and tend to occur near the eyelashes.\n', 'Inflammation of the cornea , the transparent front covering of the eye, is rare but serious, and can affect vision. If corneal inflammation, also known as rosacea keratitis, occurs, seek medical help as soon as possible.[3]']","['The exact cause of rosacea has not yet been established. It is possible that it is an autoimmune response, a reaction to high skin pH, a response to undiagnosed food sensitivity or the result of a high number of demodex folliculorum mites on the face.[1][7] There may also be a genetic component.', 'According to present knowledge, there is no way to prevent rosacea from beginning, and there is currently no way to entirely eliminate the condition.[1]', 'There is some evidence that rosacea’s facial flushing is caused by the body’s sympathetic nervous system becoming stimulated.[7] The sympathetic nervous system is the part of the nervous system that is involved in activating the fight or flight response. It is activated by strong emotion or physical stress.', 'Research has shown that rosacea can be triggered by various physical and environmental factors, such as weather conditions, exercise, cosmetics or certain foods. Many people with rosacea find it helpful to keep a diary of their outbreaks in order to narrow down what their particular triggers are.', 'Some common triggers are:[1][7][9]', '\nEmotional stress\nStrenuous exercise\nExposure to strong sunlight\nHot weather\nCold weather\nWind\nHigh humidity\nHot baths/showers\nExfoliant, abrasive or astringent facial products\nMakeup containing oils\nPerfumed sunblocks\nSunblock or skin preparations containing insect repellents\nConsumption of alcohol\nVery sugary foods\nSpicy foods, such as those containing chili\nSmoking\nCalcium-channel blockers, also known as calcium antagonists, such as dihydropyridine\n', 'Not all rosacea sufferers are vulnerable to all of these triggers.', 'Many of these triggers, such as exercise, alcohol and calcium antagonists, cause the dilation of the blood vessels (vasodilation), which increases blood flow. Increased blood flow to the skin causes a distinctive appearance of redness. Some of these triggers, for example exposure to sunlight, wind, smoking and cold weather, cause inflammation of the skin, which also causes redness.']","['Although there is currently no total cure for rosacea, there are many treatment options. Treatment may need to be long-term, but it is easily manageable and very effective.', 'Treatment for rosacea is mainly concerned with reducing inflammation and managing sensitive skin.[3] Treatment options include topical creams and ointments, oral medications, and lifestyle changes. People with this condition may find that some treatments, or combinations of treatments, work better for them than others do.', 'Topical medication: creams and ointments', 'Topical preparations, which are applied to the skin rather than taken orally, can help rosacea sufferers lessen the redness and inflammation they experience. Commonly-prescribed topical rosacea treatments include:[1][3][4][5]', '\nBrimonidine cream\nAzelaic acid cream\nSodium sulfacetamide-sulfur cream\nDoxycycline ointment\nMetronidazole cream\n', 'Some rosacea sufferers find that applying jojoba oil is helpful.[10] However, people with rosacea should never use acne preparations and should avoid topical corticosteroids, unless they are specifically prescribed by a specialist. While topical steroid preparations are helpful in reducing inflammation in the short term, in the long term they can make the problem worse.[3]', 'In cases where the rosacea is mild, it may be possible to manage it with only topical creams and lifestyle changes.', 'Laser and light treatment', 'In cases of severe rosacea, laser and light treatments are an option for the treatment of redness, inflammation, pustules and rhinophyma. Nonablative lasers that do not destroy tissue, in the 500 to 600 nanometer (nm) range, and long-pulsed pulse dye lasers, as well as 532nm potassium-titanyl-phosphate lasers can help alleviate rosacea symptoms. Intense pulsed-light devices in the 515 to 1200nm range are another option.[11]', 'Phymatous rosacea, which causes thickening of the skin and may cause rhinophyma, can be treated with ablative lasers that destroy tissue, such as erbium or CO2 lasers. The object of this treatment is to remove the overgrowth of tissue from the area.[11]', 'Oral medication', 'In severe cases, some people with rosacea find that a course of oral antibiotics helps reduce inflammation. This is true even though it is not known whether there are any particular bacteria involved in causing rosacea. Oral antibiotics that are sometimes used to treat rosacea include the tetracycline class:[3]', '\nTetracycline\nOxytetracycline\nDoxycycline\nLymecycline\nMinocycline\n', 'A course of 40mg of oral doxycycline daily is often effective. If doxycycline is not an option, 100mg of oral minocycline daily has been found to be effective as well.[12]', 'Other oral medications include:[3][5][6]', '\nErythromycin\nTrimethoprim\nTrimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole\nAmpicillin\nClindamycin\nDapsone\n', 'Blushing and redness may also be managed by beta-blockers or clonidine.[3] Very severe rosacea, especially phymatous rosacea that may lead to rhinophyma, or thickening of the skin, may respond well to isotretinoin.[6] The length of time for which an individual may have to take antibiotics depends on how severe their rosacea is and how well they respond to antibiotic treatment. However, it is important that all courses of antibiotics prescribed for rosacea are completed in order to assess whether they were effective.', 'In most cases, improvement can be expected within two to three weeks of beginning a course of antibiotics, but it may take several months to completely clear up symptoms such as papules and pustules.[1] Moreover, pustules and papules may return when the antibiotic course is over. If this happens, a longer-term course of maintenance doses of antibiotics might be effective.', 'Antibiotics can have serious side effects, so the use of oral antibiotic treatments should only be considered when topical treatments and lifestyle changes have proved to be ineffective in reducing severe rosacea.', 'Management of ocular rosacea', 'Ocular rosacea affects the eyes rather than the skin, and so the treatment program is quite different in some ways. It may cause inflammation of the eyelid (blepharitis), which is painful and may increase the risk of infection.[8] Styes, cysts and chalazions may also occur.[13]', 'The first line of treatment for ocular rosacea is to improve eyelid hygiene. This is done by using:', '\nArtificial tears to moisten and lubricate the eye, and reduce irritation. Care should be taken to use only eye drops that mimic natural tears. Never touch the surface of the eyeball or eyelid with the nozzle of the bottle.[5][8]\nA warm compress, using a clean cloth soaked with very warm water held against each eye for five to 10 minutes. The cloth should be remoistened with warm water regularly. This reduces inflammation, cleans the eyelid and provides relief from stinging.[8]\nTo remove irritants such as dust, grit and secretions from the eyelid and eyelashes, wipes with a physiological salt solution, i.e.one that mimics the eye’s natural moisture, can be used. Pharmacists can help if necessary.[8]\n', 'Thereafter, antibiotics in several forms may be used:', '\nTopical antibiotic creams, gels or drops containing ciclosporin or metronidazole\nOral antibiotics such as azithromycin or a tetracyline[5]\n', 'A course of oral oxytetracycline followed by an eight-week course of topical metronidazole has been found to alleviate symptoms.[13]. Otherwise, oral tetracyline taken once daily, along with topical ivermectin and/or azelaic acid, may be helpful.', 'People with ocular rosacea or irritated eyes as a result of rosacea should avoid eye makeup, rubbing their eyes and taking Omega 3 supplements. Wearing contact lenses may be uncomfortable with inflamed eyes.[8]', 'Home management', 'Aside from using prescription antibiotics, people with rosacea can take easy steps at home to get relief from the discomfort of rosacea and the appearance of symptoms. For many people, this involves, learning to avoid triggers and removing irritants from their care regimes.', 'Cleansing and skincare[1][3][5]', 'Generally, people with rosacea will find it helpful to avoid getting sunburned. If exposure to strong sunlight cannot be avoided, a strong sunblock should be used with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 or more, as well as UVB and UVA protection.', 'People with rosacea who regularly shave their faces, should switch from a traditional bladed razor to an electric razor. Electric razors do not come into such tight contact with the skin and are therefore less irritating.', 'Cleansers used by people with rosacea should not contain abrasives, including organic abrasives such as crushed apricot kernels, alcohol or acetone. Perfumed soaps, moisturisers and washes should be avoided. Oil-based or waterproof makeup should be avoided. Insect-repellent facial moisturisers or sunblock should not be used.', 'Hypoallergenic, non-greasy, non-perfumed emollient preparations can be used. Over-the-counter acne preparations are not helpful to people with rosacea. They may make the symptoms worse and should be avoided.', 'Lifestyle changes', 'People with rosacea, who smoke tobacco cigarettes or regularly consume alcohol, may find it useful to cut back their consumption. Smoking dries the skin, while alcohol widens blood vessels and therefore worsens the redness of skin.', 'As stress is known to make rosacea symptoms worse, learning to manage stressful situations and general life stress is recommended by many rosacea groups, such as the International Rosacea Foundation and the National Rosacea Society.[7][10]', 'Weight management can assist in the alleviation of redness, while maintaining good hydration by drinking enough water is believed to help lessen the redness and inflammation characteristic of rosacea. A diet low in processed carbohydrates may also be helpful in some cases, as carbohydrates cause blood glucose to increase, which can lead to vasodilation and thus redness.[10]', 'In people who have severe rosacea, or feel that the appearance of their symptoms is negatively impacting their quality of life, learning to apply camouflage makeup may be helpful. Many regional health communities can arrange access to camouflage makeup tutorials and workshops.']"
['Roseola Infantum'],"['Roseola infantum – also called roseola, three-day rash or three-day fever, exanthem subitum, pseudo-rubella or sixth disease – is a typically mild, self-limiting viral infection that mainly affects infants and toddlers. It causes a high fever, which is often followed by a rash on the trunk (torso) that may spread to the face, arms and legs.[1][2]', 'The rash is typically characterized by small, painless pink or red spots that turn white when pressed firmly. The spots may be flat or raised and may be surrounded by a white ring. The rash can fade quickly, within a few hours of appearing, or remain for a couple of days.[1][3]', 'Roseola is most common in children between six months and two years of age. Most children have been exposed to roseola before they are five years old and develop the antibodies to avoid repeat infection. However, roseola is occasionally contracted by older children, or adults who have not previously encountered it. If adults contract roseola, the symptoms are usually very mild.[4][5] It is possible to have roseola more than once, but this is unusual, unless the person has a compromised immune system.[2][6]', 'Roseola is caused by two viruses in the herpes family: HHV, or human herpes virus, most often type 6 or occasionally type 7.[2] The virus is spread via droplet infection, when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through direct contact with an infected person or item that was, for example, sneezed on by an infected person.[5] This kind of herpes infection does not lead to herpes labialis or genital sores.[7]', 'Most children make a full and fast recovery from roseola without any specific treatment other than rest and adequate hydration.[8][2][9] Over-the-counter medicine, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen (Paracetamol or Tylenol), may be recommended to help with symptoms like the fever.[1]']","['Following exposure to and infection with one of the two viruses that causes roseola infantum, symptoms typically appear after an incubation period of approximately 9 to 10 days, though this can  generally be between 5 and 15 days.[1][2][10] The incubation period is the time between catching an infection and symptoms appearing.', 'The first symptom is rapidly occurring high fever above 100.4 F or 38 C.

Some of the spots may have a white ring around them.[1][3]', 'The rash may have a raised appearance or remain flat, and it does not itch or hurt. It can fade within a few hours or persist for a couple of days.[1][3][8][2]', 'The infection is usually over by the time the rash develops, and most children feel well again. As the fever and early symptoms can mimic other conditions, roseola is sometimes hard to diagnose. The fever appears before the characteristic rash, and high fevers can have quite a few other causes in infants and toddlers. This is why doctors usually diagnose roseola based on the appearance of the rash.[4]']","['Roseola is most commonly caused by human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6), though it can also be caused by human herpes virus 7 (HHV-7). These types of herpes are different to the strains that cause cold sores and genital herpes.[5][9]', 'The virus is spread through droplets of fluid from the mouth, throat and nose, for example when a person coughs or sneezes.

Other symptoms include speaking in an illogical, confused fashion, and acting erraticlly and disorganized. The less dramatic symptoms are possibly more common, though not as well known. These include avoiding social life, disorganized behavior, decreased motivation, a decrease in emotional response, and slowed thinking and movements. The symptoms of schizophrenia often interfere severely with everyday life.']",,"[""The management of schizophrenia takes place in a supportive team of health workers. It involves controlling the symptoms, and providing emotional and psychological support and help to get back to everyday life. People with symptoms of schizophrenia can be treated at home, or if the symptoms are very severe, in a hospital. Antipsychotic medications help to slow down the activity in the brain that produces the symptoms of schizophrenia. These may be tablets or injections, and may be taken for 1 to 2 years after the diagnosis, or longer if needed. Supportive measures are very important, and may include counseling, occupational therapy and help from a social worker in managing the practical parts of life. These treatment measures should focus on the individual's abilities and aim for independent living. Early diagnosis and treatment gives the best chance of a good recovery.""]"
['Secondary Syphilis'],"['Venereal syphilis, commonly known as simply “syphilis”, is an infection caused by the bacteria  Treponema pallidum (subspecies pallidum).

Syphilis can be spread by oral sex, anal sex and vaginal sex, as well as any other genital contact and sharing of sex toys. Sharing food and drinks, towels and toilet seats with people who have syphilis is considered safe, as is hugging, holding hands, coughing and sneezing.[4] It is possible for syphilis to be spread by kissing, if the infected individual has a syphilis sore in the mouth, however this is rare.', 'It is also possible for mothers to transmit syphilis to their babies in utero. This is known as congenital syphilis.', 'Other treponemal diseases caused by Treponema pallidum are related to syphilis but are not spread by sexual contact. These include yaws (caused by subspecies pertenue), bejel (subspecies endemicum) and pinta (caused by subspecies carateum) which all affect the skin or bones.[5][6]', 'Syphilis used to be much more common than it is today, but after the introduction of treatment with the antibiotic penicillin after World War Two, the number of people with syphilis dropped globally. However, since the beginning of the twenty-first century,  the incidence (how many people are newly reported as having syphilis) is rising in the West, mostly due to unsafe sexual practices. Currently, there are about 10.6 million cases of syphilis worldwide.[7]', 'Syphilis is a concern among all groups, as it is a major risk factor for passing on HIV. The incidence of syphilis is rising most sharply among men who have sex with men (MSM): between 2015 and 2016, the reported number of cases of syphilis rose 18% in the UK, and more than half of these cases were among men who have sex with men. In the USA, according to the Centers for Disease Control, approximately half of men who have sex with men who have syphilis are also HIV-positive, and men who are HIV-negative but do have syphilis are more likely to contract HIV in the future.[8] This is generally believed to be the result of higher rates of unprotected sexual practice in this group, rather than the type of sexual activity  itself. Unprotected sexual contact is inadvisable regardless of sexual orientation.']",,,"['Syphilis is easily treated using the antibiotic penicillin. Primary, secondary and latent syphilis can all be treated with penicillin, but it is most effective in the primary and secondary phases.[7] Latent syphilis infection can be cured by penicillin, but any organ damage already sustained from longterm infection cannot be undone The same is true of tertiary syphilis.', 'In patients who are allergic to penicillin, doxycycline and ceftriaxone may be used. Because of increasing antibiotic resistance, azithromycin is no longer very effective.', 'Treatment does not prevent future re-infection. It is very important that people receiving treatment for syphilis adhere to their treatment regime and abstain from unprotected sexual activity.[1]', 'When treating syphilis, most physicians prefer to use parenteral (administered by injection) treatment rather than oral treatment, as injecting medication tends to happen under medical supervision, which may mean that the patient has a better chance of adhering to the treatment regime.', 'The first line of treatment for syphilis is an intramuscular (into the muscle) injection of a single dose of of benzathine penicillin.

It is usually caused by bacteria, though it may be caused by other microorganisms. Incidence is about six per 100,000 of the population in any given year.[1]', 'The condition can affect anyone but it is most common in those with underlying joint disease or prosthetic joints, and more common in older people and those with diabetes or a weakened immune system. Any joint may be affected, but septic arthritis is most common in the knee and hip, sometimes also occurring in the shoulder, elbow and ankle.', 'Symptoms usually develop quickly, over a few hours or days, and include pain, redness, swelling, heat and difficulty moving in the affected joint or joints. Many people will develop a fever. If the infection spreads, a person may also develop nausea, dizziness or drowsiness.', 'Septic arthritis occurs when infectious microorganisms reach the inside of the joints, most commonly entering the joints directly, for instance during joint replacement surgery. Infection in the bloodstream can also cause this condition if it spreads to the joints.', 'A diagnosis is confirmed when a fluid sample from the affected joint shows that bacteria or other infectious agents are present.', 'Septic arthritis is treated with antibiotics delivered into a vein, normally in a hospital stay of two weeks or more, followed by further antibiotics taken orally at home. Fluid may also be drawn from the infected joint using a needle and syringe.', 'Septic arthritis normally occurs in just one joint, but polyarticular septic arthritis, in which multiple joints throughout the body are infected, is also possible.', 'Good to know: It is very important to seek medical attention immediately if septic arthritis is suspected. The condition can rapidly cause irreversible joint damage and, left untreated, can be life threatening. However, with prompt treatment, most people will recover well.']","['The most common symptoms of septic arthritis are localized to the affected joint as a result of inflammation and include:[2][3]', '\nRedness of the overlying skin\nSwelling\nPain\nStiffness and difficulty moving\nHeat\nInability to bear weight\n', 'Many people will also feel generally unwell, with symptoms that may include:[4][5]', '\nFever\nNausea\nVomiting\nDizziness\nDrowsiness\n', 'In most people with septic arthritis, the onset of symptoms occurs very quickly, within a few hours or days.', 'In about half of cases, the knee is affected.[2] Other commonly affected joints include the hip, shoulder, elbow, ankle and, in the case of intravenous drug users, sternoclavicular joint between the collarbone and breastbone.', 'It is very important to seek medical attention immediately if septic arthritis is suspected. The Ada app can also give you an initial symptom assessment.']","['Septic arthritis is caused by bacteria entering the joint. This can occur indirectly by entering the body through, for example, a wound and traveling through the bloodstream to a joint, or by directly entering a joint, such as through injury or surgery.', 'As soon as bacteria invade the bloodstream, the body begins an immune response. White blood cells and joint lining cells may attempt to surround and digest the bacteria. The chemical signals sent out by these cells contribute to the characteristic inflammation of septic arthritis, which can cause destruction of cartilage. Depending on the infecting organism, the level of inflammatory response and joint destruction varies.', 'Most commonly, septic arthritis occurs in connection with a prosthetic joint replacement. Prosthetic implant infection most often results from local infection, and may enter the joint during the joint replacement procedure. Bacteria may also enter the bloodstream at another site and travel to the joint, which may be more susceptible to infection as it heals.[6]', 'Risk factors', 'Risk factors for developing septic arthritis include:[2][7]', '\nAge of 80 or above: 45 percent of those affected are older than 65\nProsthetic implant, such as artificial knee or hip, or other recent joint surgery\nDiabetes\nPrior joint damage, particularly from rheumatoid arthritis or gout\nLiver cirrhosis: liver scarring due to conditions such as hepatitis and chronic alcoholism\nHIV and AIDS or otherwise compromised immune system\nRecent blood infection\nIntravenous drug use\nGonorrhea infection\nA bone infection near to a joint\n', 'Good to know: People with diabetes and weakened immune systems should seek prompt treatment for all infections, including urinary tract infections and skin infections.']","['There are five main aspects of septic arthritis treatment:[10][11]', 'Antibiotics: Septic arthritis infection must be cleared with antibiotics delivered into a vein', 'Draining the joint: This may be done to clear any infected fluid from the joint. This will either be done using a needle and syringe or by arthroscopy, in which a thin, metal tube is inserted through a small cut made near the affected joint.', 'Pain relief: This is important to retain joint mobility', 'Physiotherapy: Most people will require a lot of physiotherapy to maximize functioning of the joint after infection has cleared, to promote healing and prevent permanent muscle shortening', 'In some cases, surgery: Occasionally, this may be done to clean the joints. If the septic arthritis followed a joint replacement surgery, the joint replacement itself may need removal.', 'Good to know: Treatment normally involves a hospital stay of two weeks or more, followed by further antibiotics taken orally at home, normally for at least four more weeks.']"
['Sickle Cell Disease'],"['Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an umbrella term for a group of genetic disorders affecting the body’s red blood cells.', 'People with SCD have atypical hemoglobin, a protein within red blood cells that helps circulate oxygen throughout the body – known as hemoglobin S or sickle hemoglobin – which causes their red blood cells to become misshapen. As a result, these red blood cells break down more quickly than usual and can block small blood vessels, cutting off the oxygen supply to certain tissues and causing complications.[1]', 'SCD is typically a serious and lifelong condition, requiring long-term treatment and management. The disorder is most common in people of African, Caribbean, Middle Eastern, Eastern Mediterranean and Asian origin.[2]']","['The symptoms of SCD are typically intermittent, meaning they are experienced in episodes that come and go. Symptoms also tend to vary in frequency and severity from person to person and may change over time. They can occur in conditions that cause hypoxia, such as intense physical exertion.', 'Symptoms of SCD may include:[5][6][7]', 'Painful episodes', 'Episodes of pain – also known as sickle cell crises – are one of the most common symptoms of SCD. The pain can vary in severity and may come on suddenly. Most often it is felt in the bones and joints, though it may also occur in other locations, such as the hands, feet, arms, legs or abdomen. Any area with both sensory nerves and blood supply can be affected during a painful episode. Many people with SCD experience chronic, low-level pain, often in bones and joints.', 'Painful episodes are caused by sickle-shaped cells blocking blood vessels and cutting off the oxygen supply to tissues. Although it is not clear what brings on these episodes, it is thought that changes in the weather, dehydration, stress and strenuous exercise can all act as triggers.', 'Acute chest syndrome', 'Acute chest syndrome occurs when blood vessels in the lungs become blocked, typically causing chest pain, a high temperature, coughing and shortness of breath. It should be treated as a medical emergency requiring urgent treatment. Symptoms of acute chest syndrome are:', '\nChest pain, most common in adults\nCoughing\nShortness of breath, most common in adults\nFever, more common in children\n', 'The cause of acute chest syndrome may be multifactorial and may include factors, such as:', '\nInfection\nBlocked blood vessels\nShallow inhalation, which can lead to poor ventilation in the lung\nObstruction of blood supply (infarction) to the ribs\n', 'Infections', 'People with SCD are susceptible to severe infection from certain types of bacteria. Common types of infection include:', '\nBlood infection, also known as septicemia\nLung infection, also known as pneumonia\nInfection of the surroundings of the brain and the spine, also known as bacterial meningitis\nBone infection, also known as osteomyelitis\n', 'Good to know: Infection, particularly in infants, should be treated as a medical emergency requiring urgent treatment.', 'Severe anemia', 'People with SCD will normally also experience mild to moderate anemia, a lack of hemoglobin. Periodically, however, this anemia can become severe and require urgent medical attention. This may occur suddenly or more gradually.', 'Signs and symptoms of the onset of severe anemia include:', '\nTiredness\nShortness of breath\nDizziness\nNausea\nPaleness, particularly in the eyelids, lips, tongue and fingernails\n', 'Read more about Anemia »', 'Signs and symptoms of sickle cell disease in infants', 'As a genetic disorder, SCD is present from birth, but will not generally begin to display symptoms until an infant is 5 to 6 months old.

Hemoglobin S behaves differently to normal hemoglobin, typically changing the shape of red blood cells from their usual spherical, donut-like shape, into a crescent or sickle-like shape.', 'These deformed red blood cells tend to deplete faster than usual, causing anemia, and can block blood vessels, leading to a reduced supply of oxygen to the body’s tissues.[5]', 'How is sickle cell disease inherited?', 'If an individual inherits two hemoglobin S genes from their parents, that person may develop SCD. This may also be the case if an individual inherits one hemoglobin S gene plus another type of abnormal hemoglobin gene, such as thalassemia, hemoglobin C, hemoglobin D or hemoglobin E.[8]', 'If an individual inherits one hemoglobin S gene and one normal hemoglobin gene from their parents, they will have something known as sickle cell trait and become a carrier of sickle cell disease. People with sickle cell trait, however, will generally be healthy and only rarely display signs or symptoms associated with SCD. These symptoms can occur during intense exercise or physical exertion.']","['A number of treatment methods are available to manage the symptoms of SCD and prevent complications. However, in most cases, the **disorder cannot be cured and will **require lifelong management.', 'People with SCD will be treated by a specialist and will be required to attend check-ups at regular intervals. They will also be taught how to recognise the condition’s symptoms, so that treatment can be given as soon as possible after they appear.', 'Staying healthy is an important principle of managing SCD. This will often involve:[5]', '\nAntibiotics. Taking daily doses of antibiotics, usually penicillin, is often recommended by doctors, particularly for children of five years of age or younger. This is aimed at preventing infection.\nVaccinations. People with SCD, especially children, should ensure they keep up-to-date with all recommended vaccinations, including those against meningitis, influenza and hepatitis B.\nVitamin supplements. Extra folic acid supplements are commonly recommended for people with SCD to aid the body in its production of red blood cells. A daily supplement containing zinc, Vitamins D, E, C and A, magnesium, selenium, carotenoids and flavonoids, but not iron, may also be useful.\n', 'Treating painful episodes', 'Most mild to moderate painful episodes (sickle cell crises) will not require a visit to the hospital and can be treated at home. This may involve:', '\nPainkillers, usually paracetamol or ibuprofen\nStaying hydrated by drinking plenty of water\nAntibiotics. These are strongly recommended for children of younger than five, but are optional for older individuals. Should a fever develop, the individual should receive prompt medical attention regardless of whether or not they are on antibiotics\n', 'If a painful episode is severe, professional medical attention should be sought as soon as possible. If fever appears, medical attention should be sought right away: fever is a medical emergency in people with SCD.', 'Hydroxyurea therapy', 'In people with frequent and severe pain resulting from SCD, hydroxyurea treatment is currently the standard. Hydroxyurea increases the concentration of functioning hemoglobin. This in turn reduces painful episodes and acute chest syndrome, as well as the need for hospitalization and the number of blood transfusions a person with SCD may need.[11]', 'Blood transfusions', 'A blood transfusion can be used to treat acute chest syndrome or severe anemia, as well as to prevent or treat certain complications. Blood transfusions, however, are not considered routine due to the complications they can cause, meaning they are only carried out when considered absolutely necessary.', 'Treatment to prevent clotting is recommended for all adults with SCD admitted to hospital.', 'Stem cell transplant', 'A stem cell transplant is the only known way to cure SCD. It does, however, come with the risk of severe complications, and its success is not guaranteed. It is generally reserved for very severe cases of SCD.', 'Erythrocytapheresis', 'Erythrocytapheresis is a method of reducing hemoglobin concentration to less than 30%. In this procedure, red blood cells are removed from a blood sample, and the rest of the blood is introduced to circulation.[12]', 'In this way, it cuts down the risk of stroke in adults and children from SBC. The treatment has relatively few side effects, all of which can be managed.']"

However, they have different causes. The cause of rheumatoid arthritis is not completely understood, though it is known to be an autoimmune, inflammatory condition, in which the body attacks its own tissue. Gout is caused by too much uric acid in the blood, a chemical found in certain foods, which forms urate crystal deposits in the joint, leading to a painful, inflammatory immune reaction, usually starting in the foot, when it is known as podagra. It is important to seek prompt and accurate diagnosis of which type of arthritis is present, as the treatments for each type are very different.

['Signs of Burnout'],"['As a medical term, burnout was coined in 1974 by the psychologist Herbert Freudenberger whilst he was working a job as an unpaid volunteer at a free clinic catering to people experiencing problems with addiction. He used the word burnout to describe the psychological and physiological impact which the stressors of his workplace were having on himself and his coworkers.[1]', 'Stimulated by continuous stressors related to work at the clinic, which they found to be not only emotionally and physically wearing but often unrewarding, they became burned out and began clearly showing signs and symptoms of being adversely affected in the long-term by this work-related stress, such as fatigue and low morale.', 'Burnout has since become the go-to term to describe people who are suffering from depression-like symptoms, such as anxiety, headaches, lack of sleep, fatigue and cynicism, which are specifically caused by feeling physically, mentally and emotionally exhausted as a result of stress from one’s job or workplace.', 'Burnout has been recognized as a possible psychosocial hazard of work; particularly work in high-stress environments; by the World Health Organisation (WHO).[2] However, some doctors and researchers contest the idea that the symptoms of being burned out from work-related stress are unique enough for it to be regarded as a fully-fledged medical condition in its own right, arguing that it is merely a subtype of depression.[3] See this resource for more information about the signs of depression.', 'Doctors[4] and teachers[5] are among the types of employees who are most commonly experience work-related stress, leading to being diagnosed with burnout. However, experiencing work-related stress, becoming burned out and feeling overwhelmed to the point of ill-health due to the demands of one’s job or work environment can happen to anyone at any age.']","['Spotting the signs of burnout in a coworker, employee, family member or friend can be difficult, as the condition can develop over weeks or months as their response to work-related stress evolves.

There are some key differences between the signs and symptoms of stress and burnout, as described in Harvard’s Helpguide:[9]', 'Stress causes an employee to overengage with their work environment. Feeling anxiety that their productivity levels are not high enough, they will display symptoms like hyperactive, urgent behaviour, perhaps standing out from their coworkers.[10] In contrast, an employee who has experienced work-related stress to the point of becoming burned out will exhibit symptoms like disengagement and a lack of productivity, due to feeling detached from their work environment.', 'The damage to the health of an employee, from stress, is primarily physical; an employee who is experiencing stress continually is at increased risk of neurological and physical changes, due to having elevated levels of stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline. Symptoms of stress which an employee may display and experience include a decreased sex drive, insomnia and muscle tension.[9]', 'An employee who has burned out has already been affected by these stress levels for weeks or months, during which time they will increasingly lose their energy. They are unlikely to experience new physical symptoms related to the ongoing work-related stressors that have caused them to burn out, and the physical symptoms of burnout are those of ongoing stress. Instead, the symptoms a person who is burned out will experience are primarily psychological, related to feeling increasingly listless and unmotivated in the workplace.[9]', 'In general, becoming burned out follows on from experiencing a prolonged period of work-related stress. This means that both the physical symptoms of burnout, such as gastrointestinal disorders, and the psychological symptoms, such as cynicism, are likely to build up gradually over time, before a person, or their coworkers, family and friends, begin to realise that they have become burned out.[9][10]', 'Subtypes of burnout', 'Every individual’s experience of burnout is unique, and treatment may require a specially tailored approach, taking into account a person’s life circumstances and medical and professional history. However, researchers have categorised the way people respond to chronic work-related stress into three main types: frenetic, underchallenged and worn-out.[11]', '\nFrenetic burnout occurs when people channel so much energy into their work, often as a result of anxiety, that the rewards of the role must eventually begin to seem negatively disproportionate to the effort they invest. Disregarding the concept of a work/life balance in order to channel maximum energy one’s work is common. Burnout occurs when a person works at an intensity to the point of exhaustion.[11]\nUnderchallenged burnout occurs when a person feels trapped in a monotonous and unstimulating work environment, performing a role which does not provide job satisfaction. This contributes to an overall lowering of their mood.[11]\nWorn-out burnout occurs when people give up after experiencing a period in which their work environment is consistently a source of intense stress, or which yields negligible rewards.[11]\n', 'These distinct types of burnout have been established as a prelude to the development of specific intervention strategies which can be employed in recovery from each kind of burnout.']","['According to the doctors who classify burnout as a stand-alone medical condition, the key criterion for being diagnosed is simply that one’s daily occupation must be directly related to the deterioration of one’s mental and/or physical health. This can encompass one’s real or perceived inability to cope with the demands of the role itself, a problematic response to stressors associated with the work environment, or a combination of the two.', 'It is also possible for burnout to affect people who are experiencing a stressor in their personal life which is affecting their ability to perform their job, such as going through a breakup, caring for a family member with an illness, or coping with the loss of a loved one.', 'Traditional possible causes of burnout include one or more of the following factors:', '\nHaving a heavy workload: Jobs which require long hours can often inspire a feeling that one is working continually to finish an insurmountable workload. Particularly in professions where producing high-quality work is constantly required, such as being a lawyer, doctor or teacher, a constantly heavy workload can become overwhelming, leading to burnout.\nExperiencing vicarious trauma: Working with people experiencing or processing traumatic events is an emotionally intense experience, which can inspire anxiety. Social workers, therapists and others who work in close contact with those experiencing stressors of a sensitive or triggering nature, are at risk of becoming emotionally affected by the ideas they encounter at work, and this may extend to feeling stressed, helpless, disturbed or unhappy outside of work hours. Periods of time spent processing emotions related to one’s job after hours constitute interruptions to one’s work/life balance.[12]People who encounter disturbing material as a result of their job, such as forensic analysts, are also at risk of experiencing vicarious trauma. Over time, living at this heightened pitch of emotion can lead to the feelings of distress and exhaustion associated with burnout.\nLacking autonomy: Administrative and service jobs are associated with long hours and hard work, but mostly involve following set processes, with no possibility for innovation on the part of the person performing the role. Environments where this is the case for most employees generally have low morale, overall. This is because working within a structured system over which one has no control, in order to perform duties that do not vary on a day-to-day basis, can become monotonous. Jobs of this nature are often associated with a lack of motivation and feelings of boredom and/or frustration.\nPerceiving one’s work to be futile: The sensation that the duties one performs at work are failing to have the desired effect, can cause a person to develop burnout, particularly if this occurs for a prolonged period of time. Not being given credit for one’s achievements, having one’s suggestions ignored, experiencing continual interruptions throughout the working day or having one’s work discarded rather than incorporated into projects can all be factors which engender a sense of futility, ultimately causing burnout.\nNot being sufficiently rewarded: It is widely accepted that one’s job will be more rewarding in some capacities than in others. For example, an accountant may not find their role emotionally rewarding, but would expect to be financially well-compensated for their efforts. In contrast, academics often accept that they will not earn a significant amount of money, but will expect their work to be intellectually stimulating and emotionally rewarding. Feeling that one’s job is insufficiently rewarding in any capacity, however, can be a significant causal factor in burnout.\nWorking in an unsupportive environment: This constitutes any kind of professional environment in which one feels either personally unhappy or unable to work effectively, or both. This can involve having unproductive or negative interpersonal dynamics with one’s colleagues, feeling the strain of working in a fast-paced environment without a culture of caring for one another, such as a financial trading floor, or trying to perform one’s role in an unsuitable or unstructured set-up where there are no protocols to follow when one encounters problems and/or needs guidance. These kinds of environments are also associated with having a poor work/life balance, another catalyst for becoming stressed, and eventually, burned out.Creative professionals, like artists and musicians and other kinds of freelancers who structure their own working environment, are also at risk of burnout. This is due to experiencing isolation resulting from the lack of a support structure that often typifies this way of working.\nExperiencing unfairness or discrimination: Negative emotions and the increased stress associated with being treated unfairly by one’s coworkers and/or experiencing discrimination are both directly linked to burnout in many studies.[13][14][15]\nNot sharing the values of one’s workplace or colleagues: Most people spend the majority of their time at work. When a person has different values to the coworkers that they are surrounded by throughout the working day, even if one does not experience outright discrimination, this can lead to feeling alienated, which can cause stress, and burnout.\n']","['There is no set treatment course for burnout. Many people find it helpful to leave their workplace either temporarily or permanently. However, others find it possible – through proactive decision making and/or with therapeutic support – to alter their work environment and their attitudes to it, in ways that remove or reduce the factors responsible for causing burnout.']"

Generally, it is thought that the likelihood of this happening is higher if a close relative developed the condition earlier in life and less likely if it was later (over the age of 80).\nOther factors: Smoking, high blood pressure and diabetes are thought to increase an individual’s chances of developing dementia. It is thought that lifestyle factors, such as mental and physical activity and social engagement,also play a role.\n', 'Diagnosing dementia', 'Diagnosing dementia typically involves a range of evaluations and tests.

These tests typically focus on evaluating memory, concentration, communication and awareness, among other factors. Although these tests cannot definitively diagnose dementia, they do play an important role in the wider assessment.', 'Blood tests', 'A doctor will also typically carry out a blood test as part of the diagnostic process. The purpose of a blood test is to rule out other conditions that may be causing the symptoms or signs of dementia, like severe hypothyroidism. Again, a blood test cannot definitively diagnose dementia, but may help doctors to move closer to an accurate diagnosis.', 'Brain scans', 'Brain scans may not always be carried out if doctors are confident in their diagnosis of dementia from other tests. If used, scans can be useful in helping doctors to identify the type of dementia being experienced, as well as to see if any other conditions, brain tumor or stroke, for example, may be causing the signs and symptoms.', 'Dementia treatment', 'Treatment options for dementia generally depend on the type being experienced.

Age seems to be the biggest risk factor for the condition.\nFamily history: There is a genetic component to dementia, meaning those with a family history of the condition are more likely to develop it at some point in their lives. Generally, it is thought that the likelihood of this happening is higher if a close relative developed the condition earlier in life and less likely if it was later (over the age of 80).\nOther factors: Smoking, high blood pressure and diabetes are thought to increase an individual’s chances of developing dementia.

These include depression experienced as part of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) and perimenopausal depression. Perinatal depression, including postpartum depression, is strongly associated with women, though new parents of any gender can experience it. Women experiencing symptoms of depression are advised to consult a medical practitioner about treatment options, including psychotherapy and medication.[8]', 'Signs of PMDD', 'It is estimated that between three and five percent of women experience a severe form of premenstrual syndrome called premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).

If a person thinks that they may be experiencing a depressive phase, it is recommended that they speak to a healthcare provider.', 'Q: Is sleeping too much a sign of depression?\nA: In some cases, sleeping too much can be a sign of depression. Also known as excessive sleeping or hypersomnia, a person may experience it as part of a depressive disorder. However, sleeping too much can also be caused by a number of other conditions, including hormonal conditions like hypothyroidism, neurological conditions like narcolepsy, as well as certain medications. If you are concerned about sleeping too much, it is recommended that you consult a doctor.[23][24]', 'Q: Is there a signs of depression test?\nA: There are a number of self-assessment tests, checklists and quizzes available on the internet, varying in length and complexity. While some of these tests may help a person to assess how they have been feeling, they cannot replace a consultation with a GP or other healthcare professional. If an individual has any concerns or questions about signs of depression, it is important that they seek advice from a qualified medical practitioner. They can print out or take a screenshot of the quiz results and take them along to their appointment.[25][26][27]', 'Q: What if a partner, relative or friend has signs of depression?\nA: If you become aware that your husband, wife, girlfriend, boyfriend or loved one has signs of depression, you might be wondering how to help. It is important to broach the subject very carefully and tactfully, and encourage the person to talk about how they are feeling. Listening may be helpful, and, if it seems appropriate, the person could be encouraged to speak to their GP or another medical practitioner, or join a local support group.[28] In addition, they could be encouraged to take small steps to help themselves, such as exercising and eating a balanced diet. It is important to be patient when interacting with someone who is depressed.[29] If a person shows signs of crisis – obvious indicators that they are strongly affected by depression or at risk of suicide – it is important to call a doctor, emergency services provider or suicide prevention helpline without delay.[10]', 'Q: Is it normal to develop signs of depression after the death of a loved one?\nA: After the loss of a partner, friend or family member, it is normal to experience intense sadness and grief. While grief and depression can seem similar, they are not the same thing. As is the case with depression, a person experiencing bereavement-related grief may have difficulty sleeping and eating, and lose interest in activities they normally enjoy.', 'However, the symptoms of grief tend to fluctuate, while the symptoms of depression are typically present almost constantly. In some cases, grief can trigger or worsen a depressive episode, but it is important to remember that not everyone who is grieving will develop clinical depression. If a person who has lost a loved one finds that their symptoms are severe, they have difficulty functioning in daily life, or they have thoughts of suicide, it is recommended that they speak with a healthcare practitioner.[30][31][32]', 'Q: Can preschoolers be depressed?\nA: Many psychiatrists and psychologists now believe that children as young as two or three can present with preschool depression, also known as early-onset depression. Parents and caregivers may notice excessive and long-lasting sadness and irritability in the child, as well as excessive guilt, a negative and pessimistic self-image, and a loss of pleasure in play and normal activities. If these signs are evident, it is advisable to seek the advice of a pediatrician, or a child psychologist or psychiatrist.[33][34]', '', '\n\nUptoDate. “Patient education: Depression in adults (Beyond the Basics).” June 13, 2017.

Type 2 diabetes is by far the most common form, accounting for 90 percent of all cases of diabetes in North America and Europe.[1]', 'Diabetes is a chronic condition, typically requiring lifelong monitoring, management and treatment. This will usually involve a mixture of lifestyle changes and medications, though the exact methods will depend on the type of diabetes experienced. Though complications are possible, the majority of people with diabetes are able to manage the condition successfully and lead normal lives.[1]', 'The signs and symptoms of type 1 and type 2 diabetes are largely the same. The onset of type 1 diabetes, however, tends to be far more rapid than type 2 diabetes, which generally presents over a number of months or years.

This can lead to dehydration and/or drowsiness and can be life-threatening.', 'Although type 1 diabetes cannot be cured, it can be managed effectively. Treatment involves daily monitoring of blood glucose levels, typically using a monitor at home. On average, two to four measurements will need to be taken daily, normally prior to meals, one to two hours after meals and before bed. When glucose levels are too high, insulin injections will be necessary.[2]', 'Doctors and specialists will provide advice on how to properly administer insulin. Most people with type 1 diabetes will need between two and four insulin injections per day, with the amount of insulin necessary dependent on factors such as the person’s level of activity and diet.', 'People displaying possible signs of type 1 diabetes should see a doctor for evaluation. In addition, the free Ada app can be used to carry out a symptom assessment.', 'Signs of type 2 diabetes', 'Type 2 diabetes develops when the body ceases to make enough insulin; the body’s cells do not use insulin as they should – something called insulin resistance – or a combination of the two.

['Signs of Ear Infection'],"['An ear infection is a viral or bacterial infection of the outer, inner or middle ear. The condition is common, particularly in children, and is generally considered to be non-serious.', 'An ear infection can cause painful inflammation, as well as a buildup of fluid in the ear, among other symptoms. The condition may in some cases clear up without treatment, however, treatment options – including antibiotics and pain-relief medication – are available.[1]', 'If you are concerned that you may have an ear infection, try using the Ada app to find out what the problem may be.', 'Signs of otitis media (middle ear infection)', 'Otitis media, or middle ear infection, is the most common type of ear infection. It is an infection of the cavity behind the eardrum, which is connected to the rear of the throat by the Eustachian tube.', 'Usually, this cavity is filled with air. As a result of a cold or a similar condition, the cavity may be filled with mucus. When this mucus becomes infected, otitis media results.', 'Signs and symptoms of otitis media typically include:[2]', '\nPain in the ear (earache)\nImpaired hearing\nHigh temperature\nDischarge from the ear (clear, yellowish or bloody)\n', 'Pain in the ear can occur as a result of an ear infection, but it can also indicate a variety of other conditions.

Most cases are caused by bacteria.', 'Signs and symptoms can include:[2][3]', '\nItchiness of the ear\nDischarge from the ear\nImpaired hearing\nEar pain (especially if the ear is pulled or moved)\nEnlarged or painful lymph nodes (may only be discovered upon examination, typically not by the person experiencing the infection directly)\n', 'Read more about Otitis Externa »', 'If you are concerned that you may have an outer ear infection, try using the Ada app to find out what the problem may be.', 'Signs of labyrinthitis and vestibular neuritis (inner ear infection)', 'Labyrinthitis is an inflammation of the inner ear, or the labyrinth. The condition is typically caused by a virus, and is commonly experienced at the same time as or following viral illnesses, such as a viral sore throat, cold or flu.[4] Vestibular neuritis, another type of inner ear infection, is an infection of the vestibular nerve in the inner ear.', 'Signs and symptoms of both labyrinthitis and vestibular neuritis may include:[5]', '\nVertigo (dizziness or a feeling that one’s surroundings are spinning or moving)\nNausea\n', 'Labyrinthitis may also cause some mild hearing loss, as well as some of the signs and symptoms common to other types of ear infection. These include:', '\nEarache\nHeadaches\nRinging in the ear (tinnitus)\nDischarge from the ear\nBlurred or double vision\n', 'The above symptoms may also be experienced in cases of vestibular neuritis, though they are generally a lot more common with labyrinthitis, especially hearing loss and tinnitus.', 'If you are concerned that you may have an inner ear infection, try using the Ada app to find out what the problem may be.', 'Signs of ear infection in babies and toddlers', 'Ear infections, particularly middle ear infections, are especially common in babies and toddlers due to the relative narrowness of their Eustachian tube.', 'Signs and symptoms of an ear infection in babies and toddlers may include:[6]', '\nHigh temperature (above 100.4 F or 38 °C)\nDischarge from the ear\nIncreased irritability and crying\nLoss of appetite\nPulling or touching the ear\nSluggishness\nVomiting\nDiarrhea\n', 'Ear infections in babies and toddlers will usually clear up on their own, without specific treatment. However, for babies and toddlers experiencing recurrent infections that do not respond well to antibiotics, a doctor may recommend a minor surgical procedure known as a myringotomy.', 'The procedure involves making a small incision in the eardrum to allow fluids to drain out; a small ventilation tube, often called grommets, may also be inserted. This ear tube will typically fall out on its own in around 6 to 18 months.', 'Although a myringotomy and grommets are generally effective at reducing the number of ear infections experienced by young children, they can still occur. The main sign of an ear infection after tubes have been inserted is the discharge of yellowish fluid from the ear, which will commonly not be accompanied by pain or fever. Antibiotics will typically be prescribed to treat the ear infection.', 'If you are concerned that your child may have an ear infection, try using the Ada app to find out what the problem may be.', 'Signs of ear infection complications', 'An ear infection is generally a non-serious condition, with complications being rare. In some cases, however, minor complications can occur. These may include:[7]', '\nRupture of the eardrum: Also known as a tympanic membrane rupture, this is one of the most common ear infection complications. The rupture does not hurt and may lead to relief from earache. The rupture will usually heal quickly, but antibiotics (if not already prescribed) may be necessary.\nHearing loss: The fluid buildup (effusion) that may occur as a result of infection can persist after the infection itself has resolved. This can cause short-term, but also prolonged hearing loss. Generally, the fluid will disappear naturally, though surgical treatment is available if it persists for longer than roughly three months.\n', 'If you are concerned that you may be experiencing a complication of an ear infection, try using the Ada app to find out what the problem may be.', 'Causes of ear infection', 'Ear infections (inner, outer and middle) are typically caused by viral or bacterial infections, often as a result of other conditions such as a cold or flu. In the case of otitis media, these illnesses can result in a blockage of the Eustachian tubes. This blockage creates a vacuum which allows bacteria to enter the middle ear.', 'In the case of outer ear infections, certain factors make the occurrence more likely. These include:[7]', '\nSubstances in the ear: Water or other substances in the ear may create an environment where an accumulation of bacteria becomes more likely. This can cause infection. The subsequent itching after infection can cause skin irritation, which may make an infection worse. As otitis externa is common in people who swim regularly, the condition is sometimes referred to as swimmer’s ear.\nWarm weather: The condition is more common in warmer countries.\nSkin issues: Irritated skin, as a result of skin problems such as eczema, may make otitis externa more likely.\nOtitis media: Ear discharge as a result of otitis media can sometimes become lodged in the ear and cause otitis externa.\n', 'Inner ear infections (labyrinthitis and vestibular neuritis), in most cases, follow a viral infection, such as a cold or the flu. Less commonly, labyrinthitis can be caused by an infection that affects the rest of the body, such as measles, mumps and glandular fever. In rare cases, both labyrinthitis and vestibular neuritis can be caused by a bacterial infection.', 'Diagnosing an ear infection', 'A doctor will generally be able to diagnose an ear infection based on the symptoms and a physical examination. This will usually involve the use of an otoscope – a lighted, wand-like instrument – which can be used to check the ears, throat and nose for signs of infection.', 'Ear infection treatment', 'In most cases, an ear infection will pass within a few days without treatment. At this stage, over-the-counter painkillers such as paracetamol and ibuprofen can be taken (in people over 16) to manage any pain.[8]', 'If the signs or symptoms of infection are particularly severe or do not begin to improve in two to three days, a doctor’s visit is recommended. A doctor will be able to recommend an appropriate treatment route, which will typically involve a course of antibiotics, as well as (in the case of inner ear infections) medication to lessen nausea and the urge to vomit (antiemetic) or something to calm the central nervous system (benzodiazepine).', 'If antibiotics are prescribed, it can take between a week and 15 days for the infection to clear up. The symptoms may disappear before this time, but it is important to take the antibiotics for the entire prescribed course to ensure the infection is eradicated completely.[9] If the symptoms of an ear infection do not begin to clear up after two to three days of beginning a course of antibiotics, medical attention should be sought as a different variety of antibiotics may be necessary.[10]', 'Ear infection prevention', 'It is not always possible to prevent ear infections, as they often occur as a result of a cold or the flu. However, the chances of children developing otitis media can be reduced by:', '\nNot being exposed to tobacco smoke\nKeeping up to date with vaccinations\nAvoiding the use of a pacifier (especially after six months of age)\n', 'The likelihood of developing otitis externa can be reduced by taking steps such as the following:', '\nAvoiding putting things (fingers, cotton buds, etc) in the ears\nUsing earplugs when swimming\nAvoiding getting water in the ears when bathing or showering\n', 'Signs of ear infection FAQs', 'Q: How do I know if I have a ruptured eardrum?\nA: A ruptured eardrum is one of the most common complications of an ear infection. Its symptoms (hearing loss, earache, discharge, fever, etc) also mirror those of an ear infection, meaning it may be difficult to differentiate between the two. In some cases, however, a ruptured eardrum may result in no symptoms at all. Upon examination, a doctor will be able to identify a ruptured eardrum and advise on appropriate treatment methods. Generally, a ruptured eardrum is considered non-serious and will in most instances heal naturally without the need for medication.[11]', 'Q: What is the Eustachian tube?\nA: The Eustachian tube is a narrow canal that connects the middle ear to the throat (pharynx). Its main function is to ventilate the middle ear and to ensure that the air pressure in both sides of the eardrum remains equalized.[12] When the Eustachian tube becomes blocked as a result of an upper respiratory tract infection (such as a cold or the flu), this can create a vacuum in which bacteria can collect and enter the middle ear. This can cause a middle ear infection.', 'Q: Is earache always a sign of ear infection?\nA: Although earache is a common symptom of ear infection (particularly middle ear infection), earache can also be connected to other conditions such as cold, flu, a buildup of earwax or teething in children.[13] Following an examination, a doctor will be able to identify the root cause of earache and outline treatment options.', 'Q: Are there any home remedies for an ear infection?\nA: Ear infections will in most cases clear up naturally without treatment. However, there are a number of ways that the symptoms of an ear infection can be managed at home. Over-the-counter medications such as paracetamol and ibuprofen can be used to manage the pain associated with an ear infection, for example. A warm or cold compress may also be useful in managing pain, as can the application of warm oil (olive or vegetable) in cases where there is no perforation of the eardrum.[9]', 'Q: Should I be worried about an ear infection during pregnancy?\nA: In the vast majority of cases, an ear infection during pregnancy poses no harm to your baby and – just as with an ear infection when you’re not pregnant – will normally remedy itself naturally. However, if the symptoms do not desist within two or three days it is a good idea to seek the advice of a medical professional.[14]', 'Q: What are the signs of an infection around an ear piercing?\nA: The signs of an ear piercing infection include:[15]', '\nRed, swollen skin around the piercing\nPain or tenderness around the piercing\nDischarge from the piercing\nHigh temperature\n', 'If there is a suspicion that a piercing has become infected, seek medical attention urgently to prevent serious infection.', 'Q: Ear infection or teething in infants?\nA: Although an ear infection and teething may share some signs and symptoms, such as increased irritability, it should be relatively straightforward to distinguish between the two. An ear infection is identifiable through signs specifically focused on the ear, such as fluid discharge and the pulling or touching of the ear, as well as more general signs, such as a high fever, vomiting and diarrhea.', '', ""\n\nCDC. “Ear Infection.” January 27, 2017.

['Signs of Herpes'],"['The signs of herpes are the observable manifestations of the herpes simplex virus.[1]', 'Herpes, also referred to as herpes simplex and HSV, is a viral infection caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV) and generally transmitted through interpersonal contact. There are two types of the herpes simplex virus: HSV-1 and HSV-2, both of which can cause oral and/or genital herpes.', 'Herpes is a common condition in both men and women and highly contagious. Although there is currently no way to cure the condition completely, it is possible to effectively manage the signs and symptoms.', '\nIn oral herpes, most signs and symptoms present in and around the mouth.\nIn genital herpes, most signs and symptoms present around the genital region of both sexes.\n', 'Herpes should generally be thought of as a non-serious condition, in which complications are rare.[2] If you are concerned that you may have herpes, try using the Ada app to find out what the problem is.', 'Signs of oral herpes', 'The majority of people infected with oral herpes, or herpes labialis, will present no signs or symptoms and may thus be unaware of the condition. When oral herpes does present itself, the most common sign is the presence of blisters and ulcers in and around the mouth and lips – sometimes referred to as cold sores.', 'These ulcers will typically be red in color and sometimes bleed or weep puss; they may also be highly itchy and cause pain or discomfort. Although the mouth and lips are the most typical locations for ulcers to appear, they may also present themselves on the tongue, face or any other area of skin on the body.[3]', 'In babies and toddlers, a first infection may be symptomless. If symptoms are present, these usually include a high fever and painful, ulcerating blisters in the mouth and pharynx, i.e. the cavity behind the nose and mouth. In babies, herpes simplex infection is also called herpetic gingivostomatitis or aphthous stomatitis. Refusal to eat or drink may be a sign that a baby or toddler is experiencing the pain associated with the infection.', 'Babies and toddlers who are affected should be treated with local anaesthetic medications, i.e. creams and gels, rather than antiviral medications. Always consult a doctor and check the instructions on the packet to ensure that the type medication is suitable for a child and to find out the appropriate dose.', 'After the initial outbreak, the herpes infection may become dormant and lead to recurrent outbreaks later in life. If you are concerned that you may have oral herpes, try using the Ada app to find out what the problem is.', 'Signs of genital herpes', 'Like oral herpes, the majority of people infected with genital herpes will be unaware of the condition. When signs and symptoms do appear, this can be weeks, months or years after the initial infection, though it is most common for them to appear after four to seven days.[4]', 'Primary infection', 'When signs of genital herpes appear for the first time, they may include:', '\nBlisters around the genitals, rectum, thighs and buttocks. Commonly, these blisters will burst, becoming red and sometimes painful.\nIn women, blisters and ulcers may appear on the cervix\n', 'Symptoms which may also be present include:', '\nPain when urinating\nGeneral illness, including aches, pains and flu-like symptoms\n', 'Blisters and ulcers will typically last for up to 20 days.', 'Recurrent infection', 'After the initial outbreak, the herpes simplex virus will remain dormant in the body. In some cases, no further outbreaks will occur, while in others, recurrent outbreaks are possible. Recurrent infections are generally less severe and last for a shorter period than the initial outbreak.', 'Signs of genital herpes in recurrent outbreaks include:', '\nSmall blisters around the genitals, rectum, thighs and buttocks\nIn women, blisters may also appear on the cervix\n', 'People may also experience a sensation of burning or itching around the genital area or legs, often before blisters appear.', 'In rare cases, herpes labialis can also cause blisters or ulcers to appear in and around the mouth and face.', 'If you are concerned that you may have genital herpes, try using the Ada app to find out what the problem is.', 'Signs of herpes esophagitis (herpes in the throat)', 'The herpes simplex virus (HSV-1 or HSV-2) can also affect the throat, leading to a condition known as herpes esophagitis. In these cases, the condition will typically cause no outward signs but will lead to symptoms such as a sore throat, chest pain and irritation when swallowing.[5]', 'Herpes esophagitis can sometimes indicate that an individual has a weakened immune system, which may be caused by a serious condition such as diabetes, cancer or HIV. For this reason, it is important to consult a doctor if there is any suspicion of herpes in the throat.', 'If you are concerned that you may have herpes in the throat, try using the Ada app to find out what the problem is.', 'Signs of herpes simplex eye infection', 'The herpes simplex virus (usually HSV-1) can, in some cases, spread to the eye, causing an eye infection. This will often occur when the virus reactivates itself after an initial infection, which may happen randomly or as a result of an illness, eye injury or stress, among other factors.[6]', 'Signs that the herpes simplex virus has spread to the eye include:', '\nA red eye\nSwelling around the eye\nWatering of the eye\nPain in the eye\nSensitivity to light\nBlurred vision\n', 'The infection will usually affect only one eye, though it is possible for it to occur in both.', 'If any signs of herpes in the eye occur, it is important to seek the advice of a medical professional urgently. If left untreated, the following complications are possible:', '\nScarring of the cornea\nGlaucoma, leading to optic nerve damage which may result in blindness\nLoss of vision, though this is rare\n', 'If you are concerned that you may have a herpes simplex eye infection, try using the Ada app to find out what the problem is.', 'Signs of herpes in men and signs of herpes in women – is there a difference?', 'In general, the signs of herpes in men and women are the same. However, in regard to genital herpes, the exact location in which blisters and ulcers appear can differ.', 'Both men and women may develop blisters and ulcers around the buttocks, thighs and anus. Men, however, may also develop symptoms on the penis or scrotum, while women may develop them on the vagina and vulva, as well as on the cervix, which is the lower section of the uterus (womb).[7] In rare cases, if an ulcer on the cervix becomes infected, this can cause cervicitis, a condition involving inflammation of the cervix.', 'Signs of maternal and neonatal herpes', 'If a woman is infected with the HSV during pregnancy, it is possible for the virus to be passed on to the newborn baby, normally during delivery. Although this is rare, the resulting neonatal herpes can pose serious risks to newborns.', 'Signs that a pregnant woman is infected with the herpes simplex virus are the same as those in non-pregnant people. The risk of neonatal herpes is highest in cases where the pregnant woman develops herpes for the first time in the late stages of pregnancy, as the body is unlikely to have the necessary antibodies for combatting the virus. Women with HSV in a latent form, i.e.who have had the virus previously without recurrence, have a very low risk of passing the virus onto the newborn baby.[8]', 'Good to know: When acute/florid HSV infection is present around the time of the expected date of delivery, a Cesarean birth (C-section) will usually be recommended before the waters break to avoid the transmission of infection from mother to child.', 'Signs that a newborn baby has neonatal herpes include:[9]', '\nLack of energy\nTiredness\nFloppiness (limp limbs)\nHigh temperature\nHigh-pitched cry\nBreathing difficulties or grunting\nRapid breathing\nBlue skin and tongue\nSkin rash\n', 'If there is a suspicion of neonatal herpes, a doctor or midwife should be contacted as a matter of urgency. Treatment will typically involve the use of antiviral drugs administered intravenously over several weeks.', 'Causes of herpes', 'Herpes is caused by the herpes simplex virus, which typically enters the body through the skin around the mouth, genitals and anus. It is also possible for the virus to be passed on through other areas of skin on the body as well as the eyes, though this is less common.[10]', 'Oral herpes is commonly passed on through activities such as kissing and sharing eating utensils, while genital herpes is typically transmitted through activities such as:', '\nVaginal or anal sex; even with a condom, HSV can still be transmitted via skin-to-skin contact between a person with an active infection and others\nSharing sex toys\nClose genital contact\n', 'Diagnosing herpes', 'Herpes will typically be diagnosed through a physical examination, where a doctor will check for the signs and symptoms of the condition. This will generally be enough to diagnose herpes, to confirm the presence of the condition, however, laboratory tests, including blood tests, can also be ordered.', 'Herpes treatment', 'Treatment for herpes is aimed at managing the symptoms and controlling recurrent outbreaks. The most common treatment method is the use of antiviral creams and ointments, which will usually be applied at home. Antiviral drugs are also available to help manage herpes, though these are generally reserved for people experiencing recurrent outbreaks.[11]', 'When to see a doctor or visit a sexual health clinic', 'Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted infection (STI), meaning that the most appropriate place to seek treatment may be a sexual health clinic. Most sexual health clinics operate a walk-in service, avoiding the need for an appointment. In most cases, oral herpes and the other forms of the condition are not STIs, meaning a general doctor’s surgery is the most appropriate place to seek treatment.', 'Seek treatment when any of the signs or symptoms of herpes appear.', 'As genital herpes can take weeks, months or even years to present symptoms, it is important to be tested if you think you may have caught the infection and, if necessary, receive treatment – even if you have not recently been sexually active.', 'Herpes prevention', 'To prevent spreading herpes to other people, care should be taken to avoid skin to skin contact during an outbreak of the condition. Activities such as kissing, sharing utensils and sexual activity should be particularly avoided.', 'Good to know: A condom does not offer effective protection against the transmission of HSV. Avoiding all sexual activity is recommended during an outbreak of herpes, because HSV can spread via any form of genital contact between a person with an active infection and others.', 'Signs of herpes FAQs', 'Q: What are the signs of a herpes outbreak coming on?\nA: People who experience recurrent outbreaks of genital herpes may come to recognize the early signs of a herpes outbreak coming on. These may include localized pain in the genital area and/or tingling and/or a shooting pain in the legs, buttocks or hips. Early signs and symptoms may present hours or days before the appearance of ulcers or blisters.[12]', 'Q: What are the early signs of mouth and lip herpes?\nA: The early signs of mouth and lip herpes, otherwise known as oral herpes, typically manifest between 6 and 24 hours before the appearance of the first blister or ulcer. These early signs include tingling, pain and/or itching in and around the mouth or on the lips.[13]', 'Q: What are the signs of anal herpes?\nA: Anal herpes is not a form of herpes in itself; the term refers to the development of signs of genital herpes in the anal area. The most typical sign of anal herpes is blisters or ulcers in or around the anus, which may become painful.[13]', 'Q: What are the signs of herpes on the tongue?\nA: In some cases, oral herpes, or herpes labialis, can cause signs and symptoms to appear on the tongue. This will most likely be ulcers, which will typically be red in color and may cause some pain.', 'Q: What is the relationship between cold sores and herpes?\nA: Cold sores are an alternative name for the blisters and ulcers experienced as a symptom of oral herpes. Cold sores, therefore, are caused by the HSV virus, most typically HSV-1, but in rare cases HSV-2, the virus responsible for genital herpes. Most people will first experience cold sores in childhood.[14]', 'Q: Can oral herpes become genital herpes?\nA: Although it may be misleading to say that oral herpes can become genital herpes, it is the case that the virus that typically causes oral herpes, HSV-1, can also cause genital herpes, which is more usually caused by HSV-2. This means that a person with HSV-1 can cause genital herpes in another person through oral sex, even if they are not displaying symptoms of the condition.', '', '\n\nAmerican Academy of Dermatology. “Herpes Simplex.” Accessed October 16, 2017. ↩\n\nHerpes Viruses Association. “About Herpes.” Accessed October 16, 2017. ↩\n\nWorld Health Organization. “Herpes simplex virus.” January, 2017.

['Signs of High Blood Pressure'],"['Signs of high blood pressure are the observable manifestations of high blood pressure, also known by its medical name of hypertension or arterial hypertension.', 'High blood pressure occurs when the force of blood pressing against the artery walls is higher than normal. This puts extra strain on the heart and blood vessels, which in turn increases the risk of heart failure, heart attack, stroke and other serious conditions.[1][2]', 'High blood pressure is a common condition affecting roughly 46 percent of adults in the US. The condition is particularly common in older people, with roughly 82 percent of adults aged 75 and over experiencing the condition in the US.[2]', 'Lifestyle changes and medication can help to bring down high blood pressure and reduce the possibility of serious complications.

['Signs of Kidney Problems'],"['The kidneys form part of the urinary system, one of the body’s major filtration systems. Most people have two kidneys, situated in the upper abdominal area towards the muscles of the back and the edge of the ribs. The kidneys form part of the urinary system along with the two ureters, the bladder and urethra. Kidney problems affect the kidneys, but because the system works together, the effects of a kidney problem are sometimes felt throughout the system.', 'The kidneys themselves clean the blood by filtering it in the nephrons, which are made up of a renal tubule and a renal corpuscle. The corpuscle is made up of a glomerulus enclosed by the Bowman’s capsule. To filter the blood, it is passed through the glomeruli at higher pressure than the body’s usual blood pressure. Filtered waste products collect inside the Bowman’s capsule, while filtered, clean blood is passed back out of the glomeruli into the circulatory system. The tubule collects the waste products from the Bowman’s capsule while also working on further exchanging certain substances  and also reabsorbing water and certain minerals so they don’t go to waste. The final resulting liquid is then passed into the ureters as urine. Urine collects in the bladder, which stores it until it is released by the urethra.', 'Kidney problems in adults and teenagers are usually uncomfortable, but can typically be treated relatively easily by doctors. Kidney problems in pregnant women are of particular concern because of the effect they can have on both the pregnant woman and the baby.

It is the only type of skin cancer which develops from melanocyte cells, which are one of the three main types of skin cells in the epidermis (the top layer of skin).[2] When functioning normally, melanocytes produce the pigment melanin, which protects the skin from burning and gives the skin and hair their coloring.', 'The production of melanin causes the changes in the skin that typically occur after exposure to sunlight, such as tanning, freckles and patches where the skin lightens and/or darkens unevenly. However, even if the changes to one’s skin appear healthy (such as a tan), exposure to UV radiation can cause melanoma to develop later on.', 'If melanoma is identified early, before it has had a chance to develop or spread to other areas of the body, it is likely that it can be easily and completely cured.[3] Doctors do not screen for melanoma routinely, so it is important for people to examine the entirety of their own skin regularly and to consult a medical professional at the first signs of a potential case.

However, the severity of the pain and cramps is greater in a late miscarriage and is unlikely to respond to traditional pain-relieving techniques such as taking a hot bath, lying in certain positions or taking over-the-counter pain-relief medications suitable for pregnant people.', 'More severe back pain', 'Back pain can occur in both early and late miscarriage. It is possible to experience back pain throughout pregnancy without it relating to a miscarriage, as it is a normal side-effect of carrying a growing fetus in the womb. However, intense pain in the lower back is commonly a feature of late miscarriage. It results from the muscles in the lower back working to expel the unborn baby.', 'Loss of fetal movement', 'In many pregnancies, the movements of the developing fetus can be felt from around week 16 of pregnancy; for first-time mothers, fetal movement may be felt later than this, at around week 18-20. The unborn baby’s decreased or absent movement may indicate miscarriage. However, it can also indicate other possible problems with the pregnancy and does not necessarily mean that the fetus has died. If the fetus is moving less than normal, or appears to have stopped moving altogether, prompt medical investigation will be necessary to diagnose miscarriage or other possible problems.', 'After week 12 of pregnancy, the presence of symptoms like blood or bloody discharge coming from the vagina, abdominal pain or back pain is more likely to indicate a miscarriage than to relate to other factors associated with a healthy pregnancy. Medical attention should be sought promptly if these symptoms occur, especially if they are present after week 12 of pregnancy.', 'Bleeding from the vagina in combination with abdominal pain and/or cramps is more likely to be indicative of a miscarriage than the presence of any of these symptoms on their own. Many people become concerned that they are having a miscarriage, if any of its possible symptoms occur ‒ particularly the presence of blood ‒ so it is advisable to seek medical attention to check if there is a problem.', 'Other possible explanations for signs that could indicate miscarriage', 'A person who is miscarrying may experience some, all, or none of the common signs of miscarriage. However, their presence is not always a sign that a miscarriage is taking place.', 'Other causes for the symptoms of miscarriage include:[5]', '\nImplantation. Light bleeding or spotting is commonly experienced by pregnant people around the time the fertilized egg implants in the uterus.\nLight vaginal bleeding, due to early pregnancy. Aside from implantation bleeding, spotting is also commonly present at intervals during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. This does not always mean that one is having an early miscarriage.\nBlood flow to the pelvic area in pregnancy. Many people produce a greater quantity of discharge than usual during pregnancy as more blood flows to the pelvic area.\nNormal pain and cramps associated with pregnancy. Pain and cramps are features expected of a healthy pregnancy, to some extent. It is common to experience stomach aches and constipation, which may cause pain, especially back pain, and cramps. These symptoms of pregnancy will often worsen as the fetus develops.\n', 'Rather than meaning that a person is miscarrying, the loss of pregnancy symptoms could mean that their body is adapting well to the pregnancy. Many people experience bodily changes indicating their pregnancies, such as nausea, vomiting and breast tenderness. However, these generally lessen or become absent as most pregnancies progress ‒ particularly after the first 12 weeks ‒ and so experiencing a loss of pregnancy symptoms is not always a sign of miscarriage or a cause for concern.', 'Other complications of pregnancy, which may also produce some of the symptoms associated with miscarriage, include:[2]', '\nEctopic pregnancy. This occurs when the embryo attaches outside the uterus (womb), for example in one of the fallopian tubes; a common subtype known as a tube pregnancy. As with a miscarriage, abdominal pain and bleeding or spotting are two principal signs of ectopic pregnancy.\nMolar pregnancy. This occurs when a lump of abnormal cells grows in the womb, instead of a healthy embryo. As with miscarriage, vaginal bleeding can be a sign of molar pregnancy.\n', 'Read more about Molar Pregnancy »\nRead more about Ectopic Pregnancy »', 'Good to know: A person can undergo an early pregnancy ultrasound scan if they suspect a miscarriage. This can put their mind at ease and/or detect any complications with the pregnancy. It is always worth consulting a medical professional if a person is worried about any potential problems with their pregnancy; a medical professional is unlikely to turn a person away if they perceive any cause for concern.']",,"['There are a variety of treatment options available for miscarriage, depending on the type of miscarriage that a person is undergoing. Doctors will usually recommend or prescribe appropriate over-the-counter or prescription painkillers to help manage the pain and cramping. For people who have a complete miscarriage, where all pregnancy tissue and fetal matter pass out of the uterus naturally, no further medical treatment is typically needed, but psychological treatments such as counselling may be necessary to help a person process the experience.[2]', 'For people having an incomplete miscarriage, there are a range of possible treatment options including:[11][12][13][14]', 'Medically-induced miscarriage', 'This is a non-surgical treatment which involves taking a medication called misoprostol(Cytotec) in order to induce cramping in the uterus, which pushes out the remaining fetal matter and pregnancy tissue over the course of approximately 4-5 hours. One advantage of a medically-induced miscarriage is that the medication can be taken at home.', 'Manual vacuum aspiration', 'This procedure is usually recommended for early miscarriages or as a means of removing any remaining pregnancy tissue when the fetus has already passed out of the womb. A device is inserted into the cervix to empty the womb of the fetus and all pregnancy tissue using gentle suction. This procedure can be carried out under local anesthetic and takes around 10-15 minutes.', 'Surgery', 'There are two possible operations for surgically inducing miscarriage, both of which are usually performed under general anaesthetic as outpatient procedures.', 'Dilation and curettage (D&C)', 'D&C is usually performed in early miscarriages and involves using an instrument called a curette to scrape the pregnancy tissue and fetal matter out of the dilated uterus.', 'Dilation and extraction (D&E)', 'D&E is usually performed in late miscarriages and involves using a grasping instrument called forceps to take the fetus out of the dilated uterus.', 'After a miscarriage', 'After a medically- or surgically-induced miscarriage, cramps and bleeding or spotting may continue for up to two weeks, and a person should avoid sexual activity until their next menstrual period at around 4-6 weeks after the miscarriage completes, in order to reduce the risk of infection. Absorbent products, such as sanitary pads, will be needed to manage spotting for 2-3 weeks after treatment; a person’s doctor or midwife will be able to make appropriate recommendations.', 'Post-miscarriage psychological intervention such as one-on-one or group counseling may be recommended to help a person process the experience, and to avoid developing anxiety and depression in the aftermath of miscarriage. Doctors will be able to recommend a range of available support options.', 'Read about post-miscarriage psyhcological intervention »']"
['Signs of Postpartum Depression'],"['Also known as postnatal depression, postpartum depression (PPD) is a type of depression that can occur after having a child. PPD is much more than the mild “baby blues” that many new mothers experience for a few days or a couple of weeks after giving birth to their child. Postpartum depression is a serious medical condition that can interfere with a parent’s ability to care for themself and their baby, and often requires treatment by a doctor.[1][2][3][4][5]', 'Depression after the birth of a child is relatively common, and is thought to affect approximately one in every 10 women. However, it may be difficult to recognize. Signs and symptoms of postpartum depression may go unnoticed or be mistaken for other conditions, or may be hidden out of a fear of being judged or stigmatized for not being a good, happy parent.[6][2][3][5]', 'Postpartum depression can also affect the partners of women who have recently given birth, as well as people who have recently adopted a child. It can affect any new parent.[1][3]', 'Postpartum depression may occur together with a number of other conditions, e.g. an anxiety or depressive disorder, diabetes or thyroiditis. The relationship between depression and other conditions is complex.[7]', 'Though it is not classified as postpartum depression, many women may also experience intense emotional distress, depression and/or anxiety after a miscarriage.[8]', 'What are the signs of postpartum depression?', 'Signs of postpartum depression are generally present for more than two weeks. A parent with postnatal depression will often start to experience symptoms within the first month of having a child, but they can develop any time in the first 12 months, or even during the pregnancy itself.', 'While they may vary from person to person, as well as differ in form and severity, some of the more common signs and symptoms of postnatal depression, like other types of depression, include:[6][2][3][4][9][10]', '\nPersistent low mood; this may take the form of sadness, hopelessness, emptiness, irritability, frustration, anger, a feeling of being overwhelmed, or other negative emotions\nLoss of interest or pleasure in activities that used to be enjoyable, including sex\nStrong feelings of guilt or worthlessness\nTiredness and lack of energy and motivation\nTrouble concentrating and making decisions\nMemory problems\nOverwhelming worry or anxiety\nRestlessness or trouble sitting still\nWithdrawal from loved ones\nDisrupted sleep patterns, including difficulty falling asleep or sleeping too much\nChanges in appetite\nPersistent headaches, other pains, or digestive trouble without a clear physical trigger\n', 'It is important to keep in mind that some of the symptoms listed above, e.g. tiredness, disrupted sleep patterns and low sex drive, are normal after having a baby – and not necessarily indicators of PPD.', 'A parent with postpartum depression may also experience recurrent thoughts of harming their baby, as well as recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. In severe cases, there may be suicide attempts. If a person shows signs of crisis – obvious indicators that they are strongly affected by depression or at risk of suicide – it is important to call a doctor, emergency services provider or suicide prevention line without delay.', 'For more information on the diagnosis and treatment of depression, see our general resource on depression.', 'Risk factors for postpartum depression', 'It is not known exactly what causes PPD. Some articles suggest that postpartum depression may be caused by hormonal changes after birth, but there is not sufficient  evidence to support this idea. The strongest risk factors for developing postpartum depression are thought to include:[6][2][3][4]', '\nA personal or family history of mental health conditions, e.g. depression or bipolar disorder\nLack of social support, i.e. friends and family\nA poor relationship with one’s partner\nSignificant stress or major life events, e.g. death of a loved one or a move, during or after the pregnancy\n', 'Other risk factors may include:', '\nThe pregnancy being unplanned\nBeing unemployed\nNot breastfeeding\nA complicated birth\nThe baby having health challenges or special needs\nThyroid problems during pregnancy\nExperiencing other health challenges during or after the pregnancy\nOne’s partner being depressed\nSubstance abuse\n', 'Postpartum psychosis', 'Also known as postnatal or puerperal psychosis, this is a relatively rare mental health condition that affects approximately 1 in 1000 women after childbirth. It is not the same as postpartum depression. Postpartum psychosis can be extremely serious, and is considered to be a psychiatric emergency that typically requires urgent hospital treatment. With appropriate treatment, most women make a full recovery.[2][11]', 'Postnatal psychosis typically develops in the first weeks after childbirth. Symptoms include:[2][11]', '\nUnusually low mood (depression) or high mood (mania); moods may swing between the two\nAgitation\nConfusion\nSleep disturbances\nLoss of inhibition\nParanoia\nDelusions\nHallucinations, e.g. hearing voices\nLoss of contact with reality\n', 'If signs of postnatal psychosis are present, emergency medical care should be sought.', 'Risk factors that may increase the likelihood of developing postpartum psychosis include:[2][11]', '\nA personal or family history of postpartum psychosis\nBipolar disorder\nSchizophrenia\nLess commonly, severe depression\n', 'Signs of postpartum depression FAQs', 'Q: Are there any signs of postpartum depression before birth?\nA: Postnatal depression often develops within the first four weeks after giving birth, but symptoms can also develop during the pregnancy itself and continue after birth, or appear any time in the first 12 months after the child is born.[4][9]', 'Q: What are the signs of postpartum depression in males?\nA: Postpartum depression can also affect partners of women who have recently given birth, and a father may develop similar symptoms and signs of depression in the first few weeks or months after his child is born. The condition can affect any parents, including those who adopt.[1][3]', 'Q: Postpartum depression vs. depression – what is the difference?\nA: Postpartum depression is a type of depression that occurs in new parents, within 12 months of having a child.[12]', 'Q: What if my partner, relative or friend has signs of postpartum depression?\nA: It is important to broach the subject very carefully and tactfully, and encourage the person to talk about how they are feeling. Listening without judgment may be helpful, and, if it seems appropriate, the person could be encouraged to speak to their GP or another medical practitioner. In addition, they could be encouraged to take small steps to help themselves, such as taking breaks and eating a balanced diet. It is important to be reassuring and patient with the person at all times.[13] If a person shows signs of crisis – obvious indicators that they are strongly affected by depression or at risk of suicide – it is important to call a doctor, emergency services provider or suicide prevention line without delay.', '', '\n\nCanadian Mental Health Association. “Postpartum Depression.” Accessed June 21, 2018. ↩ ↩ ↩\n\nPatient. “Postnatal Depression.” February 23, 2015.

['Signs of Shingles: Herpes Zoster'],"['Shingles is an infection that usually produces a painful skin rash, but the painful tingling sensations which characterize the condition can also occur when no rash is present. Shingles is caused by the varicella zoster virus (VZV).[1]', 'VZV is the same virus that causes chickenpox, a very common childhood infection.[2] After a person has had chickenpox, VZV remains dormant in their body for the rest of their lifetime. If the virus reactivates, which can happen decades later, most often due to a weakened immune system, the resulting condition is called shingles. Although anybody who has already had chickenpox can develop shingles, the condition most commonly affects adults, typically those over 60 years of age.', 'The early signs of shingles are typically sensations of itching, numbness or a burning pain on the skin of the face, chest or back; in most cases this develops into the condition’s characteristic rash.', 'The rash develops into blisters on one side of the body, most commonly in one the following areas:', '\nNeck\nTorso\nFace\n', 'A shingles outbreak typically lasts for three to four weeks.[3] Many people experience only one outbreak of shingles in their lifetime, although the condition can recur.', 'Good to know: Shingles is also known as herpes zoster, but it is important to note that this condition is not caused by the same virus, called herpes simplex, that results in genital or oral herpes.', 'Read more about Genital Herpes »\nRead more about Herpes Labialis »']","['The principal symptom of shingles is a painful skin rash. This looks like red or discolored skin at first and eventually features weeping blisters.', 'Signs of shingles before the rash appears', 'Before the rash appears, early warning signs of shingles, which may be present, include:', '\nItching, burning pain, numbness, tingling in the place where the rash will develop\nFlu-like symptoms such as chills, fever, headache, feeling fatigued or overly tired\nUpset stomach\n', 'After the initial skin complaints develop into the shingles rash, the condition typically lasts for two to four weeks. The pain typically worsens as the rash develops and alleviates as it heals.', 'What does the shingles rash look like?', 'The varicella zoster virus which causes shingles lies dormant in the nervous system, so the rash will appear in a dermatomal pattern; a band or area of skin on the body corresponding to a particular set of nerves.[4] The shingles rash usually appears on the face, neck or one side of the torso.', 'Good to know: If the relevant nerves are affected, it is also possible to experience shingles on the leg. It is relatively unusual, but also possible, to develop the shingles rash in more than one area of the body, i.e. in relation to more than one set of nerves. Even more rarely and especially in people with a compromised immune system, three or more dermatomes may be affected. This is a form of the condition known as disseminated zoster.', 'As the condition progresses, the rash site develops blisters which fill with clear fluid. Because shingles interacts with a person’s nervous system, the rash is often accompanied by an intense, stabbing pain which worsens as it develops. The area affected by the rash may be hypersensitive to touch, which can render it difficult to dress or to sleep in certain positions.', 'A person with shingles is contagious to others in the period when their rash is blistering. During this period, a person should avoid physical contact with others, in particular, certain population groups, including:', '\nElderly people\nPregnant people\nPeople with a weakened immune system\nPeople who have not had chickenpox in the past\n', 'The blistering phase of the rash usually lasts for seven to ten days, and the lesions should then reduce in size as they heal, eventually disappearing.']","['All people who have been affected by chickenpox and, rarely, people who have been vaccinated against chickenpox and thereby carry VZV ‒ the virus which causes herpes zoster/shingles ‒ in their body, are at risk of developing shingles.', 'Good to know: If a person who has been vaccinated against chickenpox develops shingles, the infection tends to be significantly less severe than the condition can be when it affects people who do not carry any form of VZV in their body. It is therefore, in general, worthwhile for a person, who has not experienced chickenpox, to be vaccinated against it, even though this is an attenuated vaccine (containing a weakened version of the virus that does not cause the illness), and therefore does not offer total protection against related conditions such as shingles.', 'Shingles will affect around one in three people in the U.S. during their lifetime. After a person has recovered from chickenpox, VZV remains dormant in their body. It is stored in the nervous system and can reactivate as shingles when a person’s immune system is compromised by aging, illness or stress.', 'Is shingles (herpes zoster) contagious?', 'Shingles is only contagious at the point when the rash is blistering. At this time, VZV can be passed from a person with shingles to others via direct bodily contact, passing on traces of infected blister fluids and the sharing of towels, bedding and utensils.', 'It is only possible to catch the varicella zoster virus, rather than shingles itself: If a person who has never had chickenpox before is infected with VZV by somebody with shingles, they will develop chickenpox ‒ the first infection which VZV causes when it enters the body ‒ as opposed to shingles.[9]']","['There is no cure for shingles, but by diagnosing the condition early, it is possible to:', '\nPrevent the spread and severity of shingles\nReduce associated health complications\nEase the pain\nLessen the duration of the outbreak\n', 'Following a diagnosis of shingles, a physician will generally advise on a recovery plan designed to alleviate the discomfort associated with the shingles rash.', 'Recovery plan', 'Activities which are usually recommended for a swift recovery from shingles may include:', '\nResting and relaxing\nWearing loose-fitting clothes\nKeeping the rash clean and dry in order to dry out the blisters\nKeeping the rash uncovered so that the blisters can progress into the scabbing stage as quickly as possible\nUsing cool compresses to alleviate the burning sensation on the skin\nAvoiding sharing bedding, clothing or towels, as this can facilitate the spread of infection to others\n', 'Medications to aid recovery', 'Medications which may be prescribed for alleviating the physical discomfort of shingles and combating the flare-up of the varicella zoster virus may include:[12]', '\nPainkilling medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), paracetamol or opioids in cases of severe pain.

['Signs of a Concussion'],"['Concussion is a condition that occurs as a result of a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). It involves the short suspension of the brain’s normal function as it responds to the impact of an injury to the head – such as a knock or fall.', 'Concussion can result from any injury in which the brain is jolted from its usual position to the extent that it hits the inner wall of the skull. This trauma can stretch or damage brain cells.[1] This means that, after trauma, it becomes increasingly likely that the normal movements of the brain inside the skull, which would normally not cause any damage to the brain, could go on to result in bruising and bleeding.', 'It is sometimes possible to see the outward signs of concussion, such as dizziness, nausea or confusion. In the immediate aftermath of the causal injury, concussion itself is initially a microscopic injury to the brain which will not be visually evident if the brain is scanned, e.g. by doing a CT scan of the head. For this reason, many cases of concussion go unnoticed or undiagnosed.', 'People do not always exhibit or notice the physical or behavioral symptoms of concussion, so it is important to look out for signs of concussion in all cases where a person has sustained an injury to the head. Although people experiencing concussion may display perceptible symptoms such as nausea, headaches and slurred speech, these may only begin to occur several hours or days after the injury itself.', 'It is important to see a doctor following any injury to the head in order to assess the likelihood of concussion and devise a recovery plan.[2] Recovery techniques will focus on resting sufficiently and avoiding strenuous physical and mental activity, so as to allow the brain to recuperate, thereby limiting the likelihood of any possible concussion developing into a long-term condition.', 'Signs of concussion in adults and teenagers', 'Concussion can cause a person to experience a temporary loss of consciousness, lasting for seconds, or minutes. Not everybody who experiences concussion loses consciousness, but, in cases where loss of consciousness does occur, the longer a person who has sustained a head injury remains unconscious, the more severe their concussion is likely to be.[3] Medical attention should be sought in all cases where an injury to the head has resulted in loss of consciousness.', 'In addition to a possible loss of consciousness, a person with concussion may experience one or more of the symptoms from this checklist:[4]', '\nFeeling confused\nFeeling as though one is in a blur or fog\nForgetfulness, often extending to the circumstances which caused the concussion\nHeadache\nFeeling pressure in the head\nRinging in the ears\nSeeing stars\nSlurred speech\nNausea\nDizziness\n', 'Many people recover from concussion unaided, without necessarily noticing that they have experienced the condition. However, it is possible to develop post-concussion syndrome, where the symptoms of concussion persist for weeks, months or years after the injury took place. To ensure a full recovery from concussion and prevent this outcome with appropriate aftercare, it is important to look out for signs of concussion in anybody who has experienced a head injury.', 'Read more about concussion »', 'How long after a head injury do signs of concussion appear?', 'It is very common for additional symptoms of concussion to appear in the hours or days after the causal injury. The time it takes for the signs of concussion to be present after a head injury varies considerably between people. One may be able to see some symptoms, such as a temporary loss of consciousness, in the immediate time period after the primary injury. Further signs of concussion, such as nausea or dizziness, can begin to appear within minutes, or can be delayed, or go unnoticed, for hours or days after the causal injury.', 'Symptoms of concussion which may appear later on include:[5]', '\nIrritable mood and changes in personality\nSensitivity to light, noise and other external stimuli\nReduced ability to concentrate\nPoor memory\nDifficulty sleeping\nChanges to the senses of taste and smell\nDepression\n', 'If you’re unsure whether you, or somebody else, is showing signs of concussion after a recent head injury, try downloading the Ada app for a free symptom assessment.', 'Signs of concussion in children', 'While adults and teenagers tend to experience some or all of the symptoms of concussion listed above, it can be difficult to spot the signs of concussion in children, toddlers and babies, especially as they may not be able to verbalize how they are feeling.', 'It is therefore vital that caregivers remain alert to the possibility that any children or infants who have experienced an injury to the head could be at risk of concussion.

It occurs as the result of a knock or jolt to the head, which causes the brain to move from its normal position inside the skull, damaging the cells in the affected area. Activities which may result in head injuries, such as driving motor vehicles and playing sports, increase one’s chances of experiencing concussion. Knocking one’s head as a result of falling over can also result in concussion and is a principal cause of concussion in infants and the elderly.', 'The leading causes of concussion recorded by emergency departments are:[2]', '\nFalling\nInjuries related to motor vehicles\nAccidentally being struck by or against an object\nAssaults\nPlaying sports\n', 'According to the Journal of Athletic Training, approximately 300,\u200a000 sport-related traumatic brain injuries occur in the United States annually, of which the majority are concussions.

It is a myth that it is dangerous to fall asleep following a concussion. It was once believed that falling asleep after becoming concussed could result in slipping into a coma, but this idea has been discredited by medical research.[12]', 'In fact, getting plenty of rest is of principal importance in recovering from concussion and allowing the trauma to the brain to heal. Consulting a doctor, followed by sleeping and/or resting is the best course of action for anyone affected by concussion, unless the doctor has advised that the concussed person needs to undergo further treatment related to the TBI.', 'Q: Is it possible to tell whether a person has a mild or a severe concussion?\nA: Symptoms such as loss of consciousness, slurred or altered speech, or confusion, persistent nausea and vomiting in the immediate aftermath of a concussion, may be signs that a person has been severely concussed, or has another, more serious form of head injury.', 'In diagnosing concussion, doctors once used grading systems to establish whether a person’s condition was slight or severe, particularly in sports medicine. The grading system would typically be used with the end goal of determining how much recovery time an injured player would need before returning to play.', 'The use of grading systems is now less common, but a popular and scientifically proven means of assessing concussion is the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). The GCS is a practical test for assessing how greatly a person’s consciousness is impaired. It can be used for all patients that have any kind of impairment of consciousness, including concussion. It is routinely used to screen a person’s neurological state if any kind of trauma to the head is suspected, for example, after an accident.', 'The GCS can help monitor the course of a person’s symptoms over time and can help doctors in selecting appropriate treatment for a person to make a full recovery, for example, whether they will need emergency care or a breathing tube (intubation). As standard practice, doctors will evaluate concussion and advise on a recovery program on a case-by-case basis, taking all of a person’s symptoms and case-history into account.', 'Q: What changes to the pupils in the eyes could be signs of a concussion?\nA: Dilated pupils or pupils of unequal sizes could indicate that a person is affected by a severe concussion or a more serious form of TBI than concussion. However, this only applies if the difference in size between the pupils is greater than one millimeter. Differences in size between pupils of between half a millimeter and one millimeter are completely normal and quite common.', 'Concussion and other forms of TBI can prevent the eyes from focussing easily on relevant objects, and/or working as a pair. To identify this, eye movement tracking tests are sometimes performed in the diagnosis of a concussion. These are activities, such as watching moving objects on a screen, which test the reflexes of the pupils.[13]', 'Q: How long do the signs of concussion last?\nA: In most people, perceptible symptoms of concussion resolve within around two weeks. A recent study on the effect of cognitive activity level on the duration of post-concussion symptoms has revealed that the more one rests one’s brain ‒ including refraining from activities such as using computers and smartphones ‒ during the period after concussion, the more quickly normal brain function will be restored.', 'When post-concussion syndrome is not present, full recovery from concussion ‒ including the physical recovery of the brain from the injury, which will be imperceptible to the affected person ‒ can take as long as up to 100 days.

For other people, signs of concussion may not appear straight away, and may develop in the days or weeks following the primary injury. It is therefore important to be aware that any symptoms experienced later on may be signs of concussion, and to have them investigated by a doctor.', 'Q: What is post-concussion syndrome (PCS)?\nA: Post-concussion syndrome (PCS) is a rare condition in which people continue to experience symptoms related to their concussion for weeks, months or even years, if left untreated after the injury that led to their concussion.

It occurs as the result of a knock or jolt to the head, which causes the brain to move from its normal position inside the skull, damaging the cells in the affected area. Activities which may result in head injuries, such as driving motor vehicles and playing sports, increase one’s chances of experiencing concussion. Knocking one’s head as a result of falling over can also result in concussion and is a principal cause of concussion in infants and the elderly.', 'The leading causes of concussion recorded by emergency departments are:[2]', '\nFalling\nInjuries related to motor vehicles\nAccidentally being struck by or against an object\nAssaults\nPlaying sports\n', 'According to the Journal of Athletic Training, approximately 300,\u200a000 sport-related traumatic brain injuries occur in the United States annually, of which the majority are concussions. Motor vehicle crashes are the second most common cause of traumatic brain injury among people aged 15 to 24 years, and the most common cause of concussion across all age groups.[3]', 'When to seek medical attention after a head injury', 'Many people make a rapid and full recovery from concussion. Nevertheless, it is important to consult a doctor in all cases where the condition is suspected.

It is a myth that it is dangerous to fall asleep following a concussion. It was once believed that falling asleep after becoming concussed could result in slipping into a coma, but this idea has been discredited by medical research.[12]', 'In fact, getting plenty of rest is of principal importance in recovering from concussion and allowing the trauma to the brain to heal. Consulting a doctor, followed by sleeping and/or resting is the best course of action for anyone affected by concussion, unless the doctor has advised that the concussed person needs to undergo further treatment related to the TBI.', 'Q: Is it possible to tell whether a person has a mild or a severe concussion?\nA: Symptoms such as loss of consciousness, slurred or altered speech, or confusion, persistent nausea and vomiting in the immediate aftermath of a concussion, may be signs that a person has been severely concussed, or has another, more serious form of head injury.', 'In diagnosing concussion, doctors once used grading systems to establish whether a person’s condition was slight or severe, particularly in sports medicine. The grading system would typically be used with the end goal of determining how much recovery time an injured player would need before returning to play.', 'The use of grading systems is now less common, but a popular and scientifically proven means of assessing concussion is the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). The GCS is a practical test for assessing how greatly a person’s consciousness is impaired. It can be used for all patients that have any kind of impairment of consciousness, including concussion. It is routinely used to screen a person’s neurological state if any kind of trauma to the head is suspected, for example, after an accident.', 'The GCS can help monitor the course of a person’s symptoms over time and can help doctors in selecting appropriate treatment for a person to make a full recovery, for example, whether they will need emergency care or a breathing tube (intubation). As standard practice, doctors will evaluate concussion and advise on a recovery program on a case-by-case basis, taking all of a person’s symptoms and case-history into account.', 'Q: What changes to the pupils in the eyes could be signs of a concussion?\nA: Dilated pupils or pupils of unequal sizes could indicate that a person is affected by a severe concussion or a more serious form of TBI than concussion. However, this only applies if the difference in size between the pupils is greater than one millimeter. Differences in size between pupils of between half a millimeter and one millimeter are completely normal and quite common.', 'Concussion and other forms of TBI can prevent the eyes from focussing easily on relevant objects, and/or working as a pair.

Smoke inhalation is a leading cause of mortality due to fire, causing approximately 5000 to 10,000 deaths per year in the USA alone.[1]', 'Smoke contains a mixture of harmful chemicals and irritants, though the exact composition depends on factors such as what is being burned, the temperature of the fire and the amount of oxygen feeding the fire. Inhaling smoke can cause the airways and lungs to become irritated, swollen and blocked, and may prevent oxygen from entering the bloodstream. If this happens, respiratory failure can occur.[2] Smoke inhalation requires immediate treatment to prevent complications.', 'The damage to the body inflicted as a consequence of smoke inhalation is often referred to as smoke inhalation injury.']","['The symptoms of smoke inhalation will depend on what exactly has been inhaled (the composition of the smoke), and the duration of smoke inhalation. General symptoms, however, include:[2][4]', '\nCoughing and hoarseness\nIrritated sinuses\nShortness of breath, which may lead to total respiratory failure\nChest pain\nHeadache\nStinging eyes or vision problems\nRunny nose\nLoss of consciousness\nCardiovascular abnormalities, including cardiac arrest\n', 'Symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning', 'If carbon monoxide is contained within the smoke, carbon monoxide poisoning may result.

In most cases, it causes damage through asphyxiation (lack of oxygen) and irritation of the lungs and airways.[3]', 'Asphyxiation', 'Fire can use up a significant amount of oxygen from the air, leaving less available to breathe. When this happens, asphyxiation can result. The presence of carbon monoxide in the smoke can make this particularly pronounced, as carbon monoxide takes up far more room than oxygen. Carbon monoxide is contained within carbon-containing fuels such as gas, wood, coal and oil.', 'Oxygen combines with the hemoglobin inside red blood cells to create oxyhemoglobin. As the red blood cells circulate around the body, oxyhemoglobin provides the body’s tissues with the oxygen they need to survive.', 'Carbon monoxide can also bind with hemoglobin to create carboxyhemoglobin. As smoke containing carbon monoxide is inhaled, carboxyhemoglobin begins to circulate around the body, causing the tissues to become increasingly starved of oxygen. As carbon monoxide binds roughly 200 times more tightly to hemoglobin than oxygen, this can happen even if there is only a small amount of carbon monoxide present.[3]', 'Irritation of the lungs and airways', 'A fire can create smoke containing a variety of chemical irritants and particles, i.e. unburned or partially burned materials small enough to enter the body, with the potential to cause significant damage to the lungs and airways. Such irritants include sulfur dioxide, ammonia, hydrogen chloride and chlorine. Breathing in these irritants and particles can cause blockage of the airways, inflammation and respiratory failure.']","['The person experiencing smoke inhalation should be removed from the scene and taken to a location with fresh air as soon as possible.[3] This will usually be the responsibility of firefighters. Following this, oxygen at a high flow rate should be administered via a facemask. This will help to quickly increase the amount of oxygen dissolved into the bloodstream and prevent asphyxiation.', 'Once the individual has been removed from the scene and taken to a hospital, a number of treatment methods may be used. These include:[1][3][6][10]', '\nBronchoscopy: A bronchoscopy is used for both diagnostic and treatment purposes. Using a bronchoscope, a tube mounted with a light and camera, doctors are able to identify and remove particles and secretions lodged in the airways and lungs. Pain relievers or sedatives may be administered to the individual before the procedure takes place.\nHyperbaric oxygenation: If the individual has been exposed to high levels of carbon monoxide, hyperbaric oxygenation may be used. This involves the individual being exposed to increasingly high levels of oxygen over a period of 60 to 90 minutes from within a specially designed chamber. This will help to increase the level of oxygen in the blood.\nMedications: Various medications, including antidotes, antibiotics to help prevent infection, steroids to open the airways and medications used to manage pain, swelling and fever may also be administered.\n']"
['Stomach Cancer'],"['Stomach cancer, sometimes called gastric cancer, is a slowly progressing cancer that arises from the stomach.

['Subarachnoid Hemorrhage'],"['Subarachnoid hemorrhage is a condition where there is bleeding in the head. The bleeding occurs in a space between the layers of tissues that cover the brain, in an area called the subarachnoid space. It is commonly due to a burst blood vessel in the brain, due to weakness of the vessel walls or a malformation. The most common symptom is a sudden, severe headache, often with nausea and vomiting. The diagnosis is confirmed either by doing a scan of the head or by taking a sample of the fluid from around the spinal cord and testing it for the presence of blood.

Likewise, muscle relaxation exercises can help to reduce tension and pressure in the head and neck area. Doctors will be able to recommend a variety of techniques to practice during a headache.\nLight exercise: For tension headaches, non-intensive exercise activities, such as yoga, walking or relaxed cycling can help alleviate the headache symptoms. If the weather is fine, these gentle exercise activities, can ideally be carried out outdoors, in order to breathe in fresh air.\n']"
['Testicular Cancer'],"['Testicular cancer is a rare cancer that arises from the testicles. The testicles are male reproductive organs within the scrotum (scrotal sac) that produce sperm and the male hormone, testosterone. It is the most common cancer in young men between ages 15 and 35. The most common symptoms of testicular cancer are a painless lump or swelling in either testicle and a feeling of heaviness in the scrotum. However the cancer may show no symptoms. Surgical removal of the cancer is the primary treatment. Other treatment options are generally based on the stage of testicular cancer. Many people recover well after treatment for testicular cancer.']","['The most common symptoms is a painless lump or swelling affecting the testicle. Other symptoms include a feeling of heaviness, pain or swelling of the scrotum (the muscular bag which holds the testicles). Some people feel the pain and heaviness in the lower part of their abdomen. Some men may develop breast tissue, but this is uncommon.']",,"['Treatment depends on the size of the cancer, the specific type of cancer, and whether it has spread elsewhere in the body. This determines the stage of the cancer. In most cases, the cancer and affected testicle will be surgically removed. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy are chosen depending on the stage and type of testicular cancer. The treating doctor can give the best advice in individual cases. These treatments can cause infertility. If the man would like to have children in the future, sperm banking before treatment is an option. Emotional support via individual counseling or a support group is helpful in coming to terms with the diagnosis and while undergoing treatment.']"
['Testicular Torsion'],"['Testicular torsion describes a condition in which the testicle becomes twisted in the scrotum. This causes the blood supply to the testicle to become blocked, and is an emergency because the testicle can die due to a lack of oxygen. Newborns, children and adolescents are most commonly affected. The most common symptom is sudden groin pain, often accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The diagnosis may be based on an ultrasound of the scrotum. The treatment is surgery to untwist the testicle and to re-position it in the scrotum. Surgery should take place as soon as possible to prevent damage to the testicle. With early diagnosis and surgery, most people recover very well.']","['The most common symptom is sudden groin and scrotum pain. This may be accompanied by nausea and vomiting.

['Testosterone'],"['Testosterone is a predominantly male sex hormone, belonging to a group of androgens (steroids) that are central to sexual and reproductive development. Females also produce testosterone, although in smaller quantities.', 'In males, testosterone is produced primarily in the testes, by the Leydig cells. In females, testosterone is mainly produced in the ovaries, which also produce estrogen. In both sexes, a small amount of testosterone is also produced in the adrenal glands.', 'Testosterone levels can fluctuate greatly, even over the course of a single day. The overall level of testosterone in the body tends to decrease as a result of aging. A deficiency of the hormone can also occur prenatally and during puberty. Some individuals may experience unusually high levels of testosterone. This is most common in children and young adults and also occurs in some females, as a result of a variety of underlying medical conditions.', 'Testosterone therapy, a treatment method involving an artificial form of the hormone, may be necessary for those experiencing low levels of testosterone. There are, however, possible side-effects, such as a lowered sperm count and acne, as well as cardiovascular problems.[1]', 'What does testosterone do?', 'Given its role in several bodily processes, testosterone is considered highly important to the overall health of males and females.', 'During the gestation of a fetus, testosterone is critical to the development of the internal and external male sex organs. The hormone also plays an important role during puberty, helping to enact many of the bodily changes that take place as the body matures.', 'Changes that occur during puberty include:', '\nGrowing taller\nDeveloping pubic and body hair\nIn males, the enlargement of the penis and testes\nBehavioral changes\n', 'During and after puberty – in males and females – testosterone also helps to enhance the libido and, in males, to produce sperm.[2]', 'By encouraging the production of red blood cells, testosterone also helps to maintain healthy bones and muscle.', 'How is testosterone controlled?', 'The human male and female reproductive cycles are controlled by the interaction of hormones from the brain’s hypothalamus and anterior pituitary[3] with hormones from reproductive tissues and organs. In both sexes, the hypothalamus monitors and causes the release of hormones from the pituitary gland.', 'Low levels of testosterone', 'Low testosterone, or a testosterone deficiency, can occur prenatally, during puberty and develop in adult males and sometimes females, too.', 'If the deficiency occurs prenatally (during pregnancy), the sexual development and process of masculinization may be affected as a male child matures. A male child with low levels of testosterone may experience delayed puberty, which will typically involve slow or no growth and a failure to develop the characteristics associated with puberty, including penis and testes enlargement, voice deepening and pubic and body hair growth. Those with a testosterone deficiency may also struggle to develop normal muscle mass and have lesser endurance capabilities.[2]', 'A testosterone deficiency can also develop as a result of aging, as well as being associated with conditions including obesity, type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure. The symptoms of a testosterone deficiency may be physical and psychological in nature.[4]', 'Testosterone deficiency in males may include the following symptoms:', 'Physical', '\nChange in sleep patterns - insomnia or sleep disturbances\nIncreased body fat and reduced muscle mass\nReduced sexual desire, sexual dysfunction or infertility\n', 'Psychological', '\nDecreased motivation\nDepression\n', 'A decreased libido and general fatigue are the most common symptoms of a testosterone deficiency. However, some males with low levels of testosterone may experience no symptoms at all, or only some of the symptoms listed above.', 'Females can also experience testosterone deficiency. Symptoms of testosterone deficiency in females may include:', 'Physical', '\nLoss of muscle mass and strength\nLoss of libido\n', 'Psychological', '\nLethargy\nLack of motivation\nLow levels of wellbeing\nLow mood\n', 'High levels of testosterone', 'The effects of high levels of testosterone in males and females largely depends on age. In children with high testosterone levels, it may lead to different presentation of the secondary sexual characteristics, typically more evident ones, and may include premature signs of puberty and growth spurts. This may result in a condition known as precocious puberty, wherein puberty occurs at an unusually early age, generally considered to be before the age of eight in girls and nine in boys. Precocious puberty can lead to less positive outcomes in physical development, as well as psychological changes, such as increased anger, which have been linked to higher testosterone production. However, this can generally be managed with treatment.[5]', 'Unusually high levels of testosterone in a female may be diagnosed as hyperandrogenism, a condition involving an excess of androgens (male sex hormones, including testosterone) in the body. Symptoms of hyperandrogenism can include acne, hirsutism (excessive body hair), virilization (typical masculine traits) and reproductive problems when presenting in females of reproductive age.[6][7] In most cases, the condition develops as a result of an underlying medical condition, including various diseases of the ovaries, adrenal gland and pituitary gland. Treatment will generally involve treating the underlying cause of the condition and possible hormone therapy.[8]', 'Testosterone replacement therapy', 'In people with unusually low levels of testosterone, testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) may be recommended by a doctor. While more commonly prescribed for males, TRT is sometimes prescribed for females, too.[9]', 'Testosterone replacement therapy comes in a variety of forms, including:[10]', '\nSkin patches (transdermal patches): A patch worn on the arms or upper body.\nMouth patch: A patch applied twice a day, that sticks to the gum above the incisor tooth.\nGels: Applied directly to the skin.\nInjections: Injected directly into the muscle and absorbed into the bloodstream.\n', 'TRT should not be undertaken by anyone with normal testosterone levels to enhance sexual performance, for the purposes of bodybuilding or to prevent the natural results of aging. Before recommending TRT, a doctor will typically perform a full physical examination and carry out blood tests to accurately diagnose a testosterone deficiency.[11]', 'Side-effects of testosterone replacement therapy', 'Before advising TRT, a doctor will explain the possible side-effects of the treatment method. These may include:[12]', '\nReduced sperm count and possible infertility\nReduction in testicle size\nAcne\nBreast swelling or soreness in females\nHigh red blood cell count\nSwelling of the ankles or feet\n', 'Testosterone supplements can have serious side-effects, and the long-term risks are not yet fully known. There seems to be a direct correlation with an increase in cardiovascular problems. Testosterone supplements should only be prescribed by a doctor, after confirming that a person’s testosterone levels are low enough to need treatment.[13]', 'Testosterone FAQs', 'Q: What are normal levels of testosterone?\nA: Testosterone levels vary according to the age and sex of a person. For adult males, the range considered to be normal in blood tests, is approximately 270 to 1100 nanograms per deciliter. For adult females, it is considered to be approximately 6-86 nanograms per deciliter.[14] However, the ranges used tend to differ by laboratory. If a person’s testosterone levels appear to be low, testosterone replacement therapy will typically only be recommended where symptoms are also present.[15][16][17][18]', 'Q: Is it possible to increase one’s testosterone levels naturally?\nA: A number of over-the-counter supplements claim to use natural ingredients to increase a person’s testosterone levels. However, the effects and safety of these supplements has not been widely studied.

Tetanus is sometimes called lockjaw, because the jaw muscles are commonly affected in the early stages. This bacteria lives in soil and can enter the body through breaks in the skin. This is a rare condition that can affect any person who is not vaccinated against tetanus, and tends to most commonly occur in older people who have not kept up with booster vaccinations. The typical symptoms of this condition are muscle stiffness, fever, sweating and painful muscular spasms. The diagnosis can be made based on the symptoms and physical exam in a person who is at risk.

Symptoms include depression, tiredness, weight gain, constipation and dry skin, among the others listed under symptoms of hypothyroidism above.[19]', 'As some of the symptoms are characteristic of the condition known as postpartum blues (the fatigue, lethargy and moodiness that can be experienced after delivery) or postpartum depression, the hypothyroidism can be difficult to recognize. If any symptoms present, it is important to consult with a healthcare practitioner.[2][5] You can also use the Ada app for a free assessment.', 'If the hypothyroidism is mild, treatment may not be necessary, but in more severe cases levothyroxine may be prescribed for six to 12 months. Thereafter, the medication will usually be tapered to assess whether it is still needed.[5][18] In most cases, thyroid function will return to normal within 12-18 months. However, in some people the hypothyroidism will be permanent, and lifelong treatment with levothyroxine may be necessary.[2][19]', 'In general, people who have had postpartum thyroiditis will typically be screened once a year to check that their thyroid hormone levels are normal, as they are at an increased risk of developing permanent hypothyroidism later.[5]', ""If a person who has been pregnant presents with symptoms of hyperthyroidism after delivery, a doctor will typically run tests to make sure that they do not have Graves' disease or another condition that requires different treatment to postpartum thyroiditis.[5][12]"", 'Thyroid and pregnancy FAQs', 'Q: Can thyroid problems affect fertility?\nA: Yes. An undiagnosed or poorly-controlled thyroid condition can make it difficult to conceive. This is the case with both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. However, a well-managed thyroid condition will not usually cause difficulties.[4]', 'Q: Is it safe to take thyroid medication during pregnancy?\nA: Yes, as long as it is taken as prescribed by a doctor. Medications used to treat hyperthyroidism need to be prescribed carefully to minimize the risk of side-effects to the mother and baby. Doctors will often prescribe propylthiouracil, if it is available, during the first trimester of pregnancy. This medication is less likely to cause birth defects than the other major antithyroid medication, methimazole, but may have more side-effects and, in rare cases, result in liver damage in the mother. To reduce this risk, doctors often switch to methimazole, if medication is still needed, from the second trimester onwards (when it is considered safe to do so). However, birth defects are rare with either medication. In all cases, the lowest possible dose of antithyroid medication is prescribed to avoid the baby’s thyroid function being impaired. Levothyroxine, the medication most commonly used to treat hypothyroidism, is safe provided it is taken as indicated.[2][21]', 'Q: Can one breastfeed one’s baby while taking thyroid medication?\nA:  Yes, provided that they consult with a doctor. Levothyroxine is typically safe for use during breastfeeding, as long as it is taken as prescribed.[4] Antithyroid medication is also generally considered safe for use during breastfeeding, as very little is excreted in the breast milk.[11] However, it may be necessary to adjust the time that the medication is taken, as well as the dose. It may also be necessary for the baby’s thyroid function to be tested from time to time to make sure that thyroid hormone levels are normal.[4]', 'Q: Should a pregnant person who is generally healthy take an iodine supplement?\nA: In many cases, yes. The American Thyroid Association recommends iodine supplementation during pregnancy and lactation for people in the United States and Canada.[22] Supplementation is also recommended in Germany by the German Society of Internal Medicine, and by a number of other health authorities in other parts of the world. Iodine is found in many prenatal vitamin and mineral supplements. Before taking any such supplements, however, it is advisable to consult with a healthcare practitioner.[23]', 'Q: Should a pregnant person with a thyroid condition take iodine supplements?\nA: Not without consulting a healthcare practitioner. While iodine is important for the healthy functioning of the thyroid gland, it is possible that supplementation may worsen existing thyroid conditions. Before taking any supplements containing iodine, it is recommended that pregnant people with thyroid conditions always speak to a doctor.[2]', '', '\n\nNHS Choices. “Thyroiditis.” September 19, 2017.

['Thyroiditis'],"['The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland found in the lower neck, just beneath the Adam’s apple. The hormones this gland releases control the body’s growth and metabolism. They affect processes like heart rate, digestion and temperature. Thyroid hormones are also essential for healthy mental and physical development.[1][2]', 'When the levels of thyroid hormone are too high, symptoms of hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) may present, such as increased heart rate, weight loss and anxiety. Conversely, when the levels are abnormally low, there may be symptoms of hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid), like fatigue, weight gain and depression.', 'What is thyroiditis?', 'Thyroiditis is a term for inflammation of the thyroid gland, a condition which causes the levels of thyroid hormone in the body to go beyond the normal range.', 'Thyroiditis can be caused by several clinical disorders that present in different ways and require different courses of treatment, ranging from medication to surgery. The most common types of thyroiditis include Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, postpartum thyroiditis and De Quervain’s thyroiditis.', 'Women are far more likely than men to experience thyroid problems.[3] Thyroiditis can be a serious condition, and requires management by a doctor.', 'What are the symptoms of thyroiditis?', 'The symptoms of thyroiditis depend on whether the levels of thyroid hormone in the blood are too high (hyperthyroidism or thyrotoxicosis) or too low (hypothyroidism).', 'Good to know: Some of the symptoms may occur in both hyper- and hypothyroidism. If you think that you might have signs of a thyroid disorder, try using the Ada app to find out more about your symptoms.', 'Symptoms of hyperthyroidism (thyrotoxicosis) include:', '\nAnxiety or nervousness\nIrritability\nIncreased sweating\nHeat intolerance\nWeight loss or difficulty gaining weight, despite a good appetite\nInsomnia (sleeplessness or sleep disturbances)\nRacing heart or palpitations (pronounced awareness of one’s heartbeat)[4]\nHigh blood pressure[5]\nIncreased frequency of bowel movements\nNausea and vomiting[6]\nFatigue (generally feeling tired or weak)\nTremors (shaky hands)\nFeeling of weakness in the muscles (particularly in the upper arms and thighs)\nDifficulty exercising\nEye bulging and irritation\nLight or no menstruation\n', 'Some people may experience weight gain due to increased appetite in hyperthyroidism.[7][8][9][10][11][12]', 'Symptoms of hypothyroidism include:', '\nFatigue (generally feeling tired or weak)\nDepression\nForgetfulness\nSensitivity to cold\nDry skin\nPoor exercise tolerance\nConstipation\nUnexplained weight gain\nBrittle nails\nHair loss\nTongue enlargement (swelling)\n', 'In addition, there may be menstrual irregularities.[13][14][15]', 'Thyroid goiter', 'People affected by thyroiditis may present with a goiter – the medical term for an enlarged thyroid gland. There may be noticeable swelling in the lower part of the neck. Goiters can be related to hyper or hypothyroidism, as well as thyroid nodules and a number of other conditions that affect the thyroid.', 'Thyroid goiters are usually painless, but can cause a tight feeling in the throat, hoarseness, coughing, and difficulty swallowing and breathing (if they are very large). A goiter does not necessarily indicate that thyroid function has been compromised, and small thyroid goiters may not require medical treatment.[16]', 'Types of thyroiditis', 'There are a number of different types of thyroiditis. Many of these thyroid problems seem to run in families, and they tend to affect a higher number of women than men.[3]', 'Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (Hashimoto’s disease)', 'Also known as chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis or disease - sometimes written as Hashimoto thyroiditis - is the most common type of thyroiditis. It is an autoimmune condition in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the thyroid gland, causing inflammation and gradual damage that can lead to hypothyroidism over time. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is more prevalent among women than men, and is commonly associated with a family history of thyroid disease.[17]', 'Hashimoto’s thyroiditis tends to progress slowly and can take months or even years to be detected.[1] Those affected may present with a painless goiter, symptoms of hypothyroidism and high levels of thyroid antibodies. Though less common, there may also be symptoms of hyperthyroidism. In some cases, the disease may begin with a period of hyperthyroidism, which leads to hypothyroidism as the thyroid gland becomes damaged. The hypothyroidism, which is often lifelong, is treated with thyroid hormone replacement. Sometimes, periods of thyroid over- and underactivity may alternate over the course of the disease. Regular monitoring and blood tests can help a person manage any thyroid hormone fluctuations that occur.[17]', 'Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is sometimes associated with other autoimmune conditions, including Addison’s disease, type 1 diabetes, pernicious anemia, celiac disease and connective tissue disorders like rheumatoid arthritis. For more information, see the dedicated page on Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.', 'Ord’s thyroiditis', 'Also known as Ord’s disease, this autoimmune condition is characterized by atrophy of the thyroid gland and hypothyroidism. It is very similar to Hashimoto’s disease, apart from the shrinking of the thyroid gland instead of the development of a goiter. Ord’s disease and Hashimoto’s disease have historically been classified as separate disorders, but research suggests that they may instead be different manifestations of autoimmune thyroiditis, with some medical practitioners calling for the combined term Ord-Hashimoto’s disease to be used.[18]', 'Silent thyroiditis', 'Also known as painless thyroiditis or subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis, this is an autoimmune disease (autoimmune meaning that the immune system attacks healthy cells) that presents with an initial period of hyperthyroidism (three months or less), followed by temporary hypothyroidism.', 'Silent thyroiditis generally resolves on its own within 12-18 months,[1] though in some cases the hypothyroidism may occasionally be permanent. Treatment may include beta-blockers to relieve the symptoms of hyperthyroidism and thyroid hormone replacement, when necessary, in the hypothyroid phase.', 'Postpartum thyroiditis', 'Sometimes classified as a type of silent thyroiditis, postpartum thyroiditis is a type of thyroiditis after pregnancy that affects people who have recently (within the last 12 months) given birth, or had a miscarriage, or medical abortion.[19] The condition is autoimmune in nature and typically manifests with an initial period of hyperthyroidism, followed by hypothyroidism that may be temporary or permanent. Not all people experience both phases.[1] Postpartum thyroiditis most often affects people with a prior history of thyroid dysfunction, and resembles Hashimoto’s thyroiditis – as does regular silent thyroiditis. They are considered variants of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.[20]', 'Drug-induced thyroiditis', 'Some medications may cause hypothyroidism or, more rarely, hyperthyroidism. Treatment with lithium is known to cause hypothyroidism in 5-15 percent of people and goiter in up to 37 percent.[21] Iodine and iodine-containing medications, such as amiodarone, interleukin-2 (IL-2) or interferon, can also affect thyroid function.[22] Drugs used to treat hyperthyroidism can result in a hypothyroid state, and vice versa, if dosages are incorrect for a particular person. Treatment requires management of medications and dosages with a doctor.', 'Riedel’s thyroiditis', 'Sometimes also called Riedel’s struma or invasive fibrous thyroiditis, this is an extremely rare type of thyroiditis. The cause is unclear, though it is thought to be either an autoimmune or primary fibrotic (referring to an excessive build-up of connective tissue) disorder. Riedel’s thyroiditis typically presents with a hard, painless mass in the front of the neck. As the disease progresses, affected people may experience hoarseness, difficulty swallowing and breathing, as well as choking. There may also be hypothyroidism and hypoparathyroidism. Treatment may involve corticosteroids, thyroid hormone replacement and surgery.[23][24]', 'De Quervain’s thyroiditis (subacute thyroiditis)', 'Also known as painful subacute thyroiditis, subacute nonsuppurative thyroiditis, giant cell thyroiditis and subacute granulomatous thyroiditis, this is a relatively rare condition that mostly affects middle-aged women who have recently had a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract. Overall, De Quervain’s thyroiditis is the most common cause of a painful thyroid gland.', 'The main symptoms of De Quervain’s thyroiditis are fever, pain in the throat and thyroid region of the neck (which may radiate to the jaw and ears) and an enlarged thyroid gland. Initially, a person with De Quervain’s may present with symptoms of hyperthyroidism, as the condition causes the release of high levels of thyroid hormone. This is sometimes followed by a temporary (transient) phase of hypothyroidism.', 'De Quervain’s thyroiditis is usually self-limiting, with the condition clearing on its own within a few months. Treatment is aimed at minimizing pain and discomfort, and aspirin or another NSAID (Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug), such as ibuprofen may be recommended. In severe cases, a corticosteroid may be prescribed as a potent anti-inflammatory measure. A beta-blocker may be given to ease some of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, like a racing heart, high blood pressure, feeling agitated or having tremors. Antithyroid medication is not usually necessary. The temporary hypothyroidism that is often the last stage of the condition, before patients recover, may necessitate short-term treatment with thyroid hormone replacement.', 'Thyroid function generally returns to normal (a euthyroid state), though in a few cases De Quervain’s can recur and result in permanent hypothyroidism.[25]', 'Radiation-induced thyroiditis', 'A number of people who undergo radioactive iodine therapy for hyperthyroidism, develop radiation-induced thyroiditis after the procedure. Radiation therapy for certain cancers, such as lymphoma, head and neck cancers, can also trigger thyroiditis.[26] Those affected may present with symptoms of hyper or hypothyroidism,[1] as well as tenderness in the thyroid area. Treatment may involve beta-blockers to alleviate symptoms of temporary (transient) hyperthyroidism, painkillers[26] and thyroid hormone replacement where necessary.[27]', 'Acute infectious thyroiditis', ""This very rare type of thyroiditis, also known as suppurative thyroiditis or acute thyroiditis (to be distinguished from subacute thyroiditis), is caused by an infection of the thyroid gland with bacteria or other microbes. The disease is associated with a weakened immune system that may be caused by any number of reasons or, in the case of children, an abnormality in the development of the thyroid gland.[1] Most people affected by acute infectious thyroiditis have a pre-existing thyroid disorder such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis or thyroid cancer.[28]"", 'Symptoms include pain in the front of the neck, soreness in the throat, fever and a rapid heart rate. Thyroid hormone levels tend to be within the normal range. The cause of infection is typically determined using fine-needle aspiration (a type of biopsy), after which a treatment option will be prescribed. Most likely, this will require antibiotics or other antimicrobial agents and, in the case of an abscess, surgical drainage. Without effective and timely treatment, the condition can potentially be life-threatening.[29]', 'Diagnosis of thyroiditis (thyroid tests)', 'A number of diagnostic methods may be used to confirm that thyroiditis or another thyroid condition is present, including blood tests and ultrasound scans.', 'Blood tests', 'Thyroiditis is typically diagnosed with a thyroid function test. This is a laboratory blood test that looks at levels of the following:[30]', '\nTSH (thyroid stimulating hormone)\nFT4 (free thyroxine)\nFT3 (free triiodothyronine) – only occasionally\n', 'The amount of thyroxine (the thyroid’s main hormone) secreted by the thyroid gland is regulated by the pituitary gland (also called the hypophysis, a small hormone gland located at the base of the brain). The pituitary gland secretes TSH according to the amount of T4 (thyroxine) that is needed. T4 is converted into T3 (triiodothyronine), which is the biologically active form of thyroid hormone.[30]', 'If the level of TSH is high and the FT4 low in a thyroid blood test, it indicates hypothyroidism. Conversely, if the level of TSH is low and the FT4 high, hyperthyroidism is indicated. The ranges used vary slightly by country and lab.[30]', 'Where the TSH level is slightly elevated, but the FT4 level is normal, subclinical or mild hypothyroidism is indicated. Because this may progress to full-blown hypothyroidism, follow-up tests may be recommended.[30]', 'When autoimmune thyroiditis is suspected, a doctor may order further blood tests to see whether thyroid antibodies are present at levels above the reference range. These include thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) and thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb) to confirm Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, and thyroid stimulating hormone receptor antibodies (TSHR Ab), which are also called TSH receptor antibodies (TRAbs), in the case of Graves’ disease.[30]', 'Thyroid ultrasound', 'This non-invasive test may be ordered to check the thyroid gland for swelling and nodules, and blood circulation pattern. An ultrasound is also used to check the parathyroid glands (four glands that are situated on the back of the thyroid and produce parathyroid hormone, which affects the body’s calcium metabolism).[31]', 'Radioactive iodine uptake test', 'In some cases (particularly when hyperthyroidism is present), a radioactive iodine uptake test may be recommended – often together with a thyroid scan (a specialized imaging procedure). In both of these tests, a small amount of a weak radioactive substance is administered.[32]\nA radioactive iodine uptake test allows the medical practitioner to determine whether the thyroid gland, which naturally takes up iodine,[33] is functioning normally, and why thyroid hormone levels may be out of range. A scan can detect thyroid nodules and inflammation.[32]', 'Fine needle aspiration', 'If a suspicious thyroid nodule is detected, a fine needle aspiration biopsy may be performed to determine whether it is benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous).[34]', 'Thyroiditis treatments', 'Treatment depends on the type of thyroiditis, as well as its progression. Pain and inflammation caused by thyroiditis may be treated with aspirin, ibuprofen or other anti-inflammatory painkillers (NSAIDs), with the addition of corticosteroids where necessary.', 'Hypothyroidism', 'An underactive thyroid is treated with thyroid hormone replacement. This usually takes the form of levothyroxine (a synthetic/lab-created form of T4), with the dosage determined by the severity of the hypothyroidism, as well as the weight and age of the affected person. Regular thyroid blood tests are necessary to ensure that the levels of thyroid hormone do not become too high (thyrotoxicosis)[35] or remain too low.[36]', 'Hyperthyroidism', 'An overactive thyroid can be treated in a number of ways. There is no single preferred method – the chosen option usually depends on the type and severity of hyperthyroidism, as well as the age and general health of the affected person.', 'Treatment methods include antithyroid drugs like methimazole, which block the ability of the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormone, radioactive iodine, which destroys the thyroid cells that produce thyroid hormone and thyroid surgery (thyroidectomy), where most of the thyroid gland is removed, and the resultant hypothyroidism is treated with levothyroxine. Beta-blockers may be prescribed to lessen the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, mainly fast heart rate and high blood pressure, while treatments are taking effect.[7]', 'Because treatment will depend on the type of thyroiditis experienced, consultation with a medical professional is very important. Taking over-the-counter medication without advice from a healthcare provider is not recommended.', 'Other thyroid conditions', 'Graves’ disease', 'Also known as diffuse toxic goiter and Basedow’s disease, Graves’ disease is an autoimmune condition in which the thyroid gland is stimulated to produce too much thyroid hormone, causing hyperthyroidism or thyrotoxicosis. Like Hashimoto’s disease, it seems to have a genetic component and is more prevalent among women than men. Graves’ disease is one of the most common causes of hyperthyroidism.[35]', 'People affected by Graves’ disease may present with painless enlargement of the thyroid gland, symptoms of hyperthyroidism and high levels of thyroid antibodies. In addition, there may be symptoms of Graves’ ophthalmopathy, where the eyes are affected by a gritty sensation, pain or pressure. There may also be swollen eyelids, light sensitivity, double vision or bulging eyes, among other symptoms. Graves’ ophthalmopathy is seen in approximately 30 percent of people affected by Graves’ disease. There may also be reddening and thickening of the skin, most often on the shins or tops of the feet. This is called Graves’ dermopathy[37] or pretibial myxedema,[38] and is rare.', 'The hyperthyroidism is treated with antithyroid medication, radioactive iodine or thyroid surgery. Where permanent hypothyroidism results, levothyroxine is prescribed to replace the thyroid hormone and is typically taken for life.[35]', 'Thyroid nodules', 'Thyroid nodules are lumps in the thyroid gland. They may be solid or filled with fluid. Nodules may be too small to detect without a physical examination, thyroid ultrasound or thyroid scan, or large enough that they are visible and, in rare cases, even obstruct breathing or swallowing.[39]', 'The majority of thyroid nodules do not cause any symptoms. However, some produce extra thyroxine, which can cause symptoms of hyperthyroidism as thyroid hormone levels go out of range.', 'Thyroid nodules may be associated with iodine deficiency (rare in the United States, more common in many regions of Europe), overgrowth of normal thyroid tissue (thyroid adenomas) or Hashimoto’s disease, among other conditions.[40][41]', 'A thyroid nodule may also be a sign of thyroid cancer. However, most thyroid nodules are benign (non-cancerous growths). It is estimated that only two to three out of 20 thyroid nodules are cancerous.[42]', 'If a thyroid nodule is non-cancerous (benign) and not causing any symptoms, treatment may not be necessary. A doctor may simply opt to perform regular examinations and thyroid function tests to monitor its progress. Large nodules, and those that cause symptoms, may be removed surgically or treated with radioactive iodine (if they are producing thyroxine).[43]', 'Thyroid cancer', 'Thyroid cancer is relatively rare, but rates seem to be increasing. It is thought that this is due to advances in technology which allow medical practitioners to detect small thyroid cancers that may previously have gone unnoticed. Most cases of thyroid cancer are treatable and can be cured, allowing those affected to live a normal life.[44][45]', 'Early symptoms of thyroid cancer are rarely noticeable. However, in some cases, firm, painless nodules may be noted. Later symptoms may include rapid growth of a goiter, throat hoarseness or pain that does not go away, difficulty swallowing or breathing, pain in the front of the neck and an unexplained cough.[45][46][47]', 'There are four main types of thyroid cancer:', '\nPapillary (the most common type)\nFollicular (the second most common type)\nMedullary (rare, may run in families)\nAnaplastic (rare, an aggressive type of thyroid cancer)\n', 'Treatment depends on the type of thyroid cancer and may involve full (or, in rare cases, partial) removal of the thyroid gland during thyroid surgery, radioactive iodine therapy, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Levothyroxine is prescribed to prevent hypothyroidism after treatment, and is taken for life.[45]', 'Thyroiditis FAQs', 'Q: Is there a special thyroid diet?\nA: There is no specific thyroid diet that is recommended for people affected by thyroid disorders. A healthy, balanced diet is generally sufficient. It is not advisable to take special supplements, including iodine preparations, without first consulting a doctor.', 'Some foods and supplements can, however, interfere with the absorption of levothyroxine, so those taking this medication should keep in mind the following:', '\nAfter taking calcium-rich foods or supplements, wait four hours before taking levothyroxine\nAfter taking iron tablets, wait two hours before taking levothyroxine\nWait as long as possible after taking levothyroxine before eating soya or soy products\n', 'In addition, kelp and iodine supplements should be avoided unless otherwise recommended by a healthcare provider, as they can potentially aggravate thyroid disorders. A healthy, varied diet usually provides sufficient amounts of iodine. In many countries, where the normal diet contains too little iodine, table salt is iodized, meaning it has iodine added to it, to help prevent iodine deficiency from occurring.', 'Vegetables of the Brassica family, such as cabbage, broccoli and kale, may be implicated in the development of a goiter in some people, but only in very rare cases where consumption is extremely high. It is not a problem under normal dietary conditions.[48]', 'Q: What is thyroid hair loss?\nA: This is the phrase used to describe the loss of hair that may occur in severe, prolonged hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. The hair loss tends to affect the entire scalp, as opposed to small areas, and the hair may appear sparse. There may also be loss of eyebrow hair. Thyroid hair loss is unusual in mild thyroid disorders.', 'The hair typically grows back once the thyroid disorder has been successfully treated. However, this may take a few months, and regrowth is not always complete.[49] Partial hair loss is listed as a possibility during the first few months of treatment with levothyroxine.[50] In rare cases, antithyroid drugs may also be associated with hair loss.[49]', 'Q: What precautions need to be taken with the thyroid in pregnancy?\nA: Normal levels of thyroid hormone in an expectant mother are essential for the healthy development of the baby. People with pre-existing thyroid conditions may need to adjust the dosage of their medication during pregnancy, with regular thyroid function tests to ensure that their thyroid hormone levels are within the optimal range.', 'In some parts of the world, such as Germany, pregnant women may be encouraged to take iodine supplements to compensate for deficiencies in the soil and the lack of fortification of food products. A doctor will be able to advise on whether supplementation is necessary. For more information, see the thyroid and pregnancy resource.', 'People who develop symptoms of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism while pregnant need to seek immediate medical care. If symptoms of postpartum thyroiditis are present after the delivery of the baby, the mother should consult with a doctor. Postpartum thyroiditis may be mistaken for postpartum depression.[9]', 'Q: Can thyroiditis cause cancer?\nA: While thyroiditis itself does not cause cancer, some types of thyroiditis, e.g. Hashimoto’s disease, may be associated with an increase in a person’s risk of developing thyroid cancer and certain other types of cancer.[51][52] It is advisable to speak to a doctor about any cancer concerns you may have.', 'Q: Can thyroiditis recur?\nA: Yes, thyroiditis can come back or return, meaning that the condition can occur more than once. A person may also experience repeat episodes of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism as a result of some types of thyroiditis.', 'Q: Can thyroiditis cause a sore throat?\nA: Yes, a sore throat can be a sign of some types of thyroiditis, such as subacute thyroiditis and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. See the dedicated sections above for more information.[53][54]', 'Q: Can thyroiditis cause swollen lymph nodes?\nA: Swollen lymph nodes in the neck can be a sign of thyroiditis that is autoimmune in nature, e.g. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, as well as in acute infectious thyroiditis. However, swollen lymph glands can also be a sign of many other conditions. If you have swollen lymph nodes and other signs of a thyroid problem, it is advisable to consult a doctor.[55][56]', 'Q: Can a thyroid nodule cause weight gain?\nA: Most thyroid nodules themselves do not affect a person’s weight. However, a thyroid nodule can be associated with Hashimoto’s disease, which is a thyroid condition that can lead to weight gain and other symptoms of hypothyroidism.', 'Q: Do I have thyroiditis?\nA: If you think that you might have thyroiditis, try using the Ada app to find out more about your symptoms, and consult a doctor.', '', '\n\nNHS Choices. “Thyroiditis.” 26 September, 2014.

There may be noticeable swelling in the lower part of the neck. Goiters can be related to hyper or hypothyroidism, as well as thyroid nodules and a number of other conditions that affect the thyroid.', 'Thyroid goiters are usually painless, but can cause a tight feeling in the throat, hoarseness, coughing, and difficulty swallowing and breathing (if they are very large). A goiter does not necessarily indicate that thyroid function has been compromised, and small thyroid goiters may not require medical treatment.[16]']",,"['Treatment depends on the type of thyroiditis, as well as its progression. Pain and inflammation caused by thyroiditis may be treated with aspirin, ibuprofen or other anti-inflammatory painkillers (NSAIDs), with the addition of corticosteroids where necessary.', 'Hypothyroidism', 'An underactive thyroid is treated with thyroid hormone replacement. This usually takes the form of levothyroxine (a synthetic/lab-created form of T4), with the dosage determined by the severity of the hypothyroidism, as well as the weight and age of the affected person. Regular thyroid blood tests are necessary to ensure that the levels of thyroid hormone do not become too high (thyrotoxicosis)[35] or remain too low.[36]', 'Hyperthyroidism', 'An overactive thyroid can be treated in a number of ways. There is no single preferred method – the chosen option usually depends on the type and severity of hyperthyroidism, as well as the age and general health of the affected person.', 'Treatment methods include antithyroid drugs like methimazole, which block the ability of the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormone, radioactive iodine, which destroys the thyroid cells that produce thyroid hormone and thyroid surgery (thyroidectomy), where most of the thyroid gland is removed, and the resultant hypothyroidism is treated with levothyroxine. Beta-blockers may be prescribed to lessen the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, mainly fast heart rate and high blood pressure, while treatments are taking effect.[7]', 'Because treatment will depend on the type of thyroiditis experienced, consultation with a medical professional is very important. Taking over-the-counter medication without advice from a healthcare provider is not recommended.', 'Other thyroid conditions', 'Graves’ disease', 'Also known as diffuse toxic goiter and Basedow’s disease, Graves’ disease is an autoimmune condition in which the thyroid gland is stimulated to produce too much thyroid hormone, causing hyperthyroidism or thyrotoxicosis. Like Hashimoto’s disease, it seems to have a genetic component and is more prevalent among women than men. Graves’ disease is one of the most common causes of hyperthyroidism.[35]', 'People affected by Graves’ disease may present with painless enlargement of the thyroid gland, symptoms of hyperthyroidism and high levels of thyroid antibodies. In addition, there may be symptoms of Graves’ ophthalmopathy, where the eyes are affected by a gritty sensation, pain or pressure. There may also be swollen eyelids, light sensitivity, double vision or bulging eyes, among other symptoms. Graves’ ophthalmopathy is seen in approximately 30 percent of people affected by Graves’ disease. There may also be reddening and thickening of the skin, most often on the shins or tops of the feet. This is called Graves’ dermopathy[37] or pretibial myxedema,[38] and is rare.', 'The hyperthyroidism is treated with antithyroid medication, radioactive iodine or thyroid surgery. Where permanent hypothyroidism results, levothyroxine is prescribed to replace the thyroid hormone and is typically taken for life.[35]', 'Thyroid nodules', 'Thyroid nodules are lumps in the thyroid gland. They may be solid or filled with fluid. Nodules may be too small to detect without a physical examination, thyroid ultrasound or thyroid scan, or large enough that they are visible and, in rare cases, even obstruct breathing or swallowing.[39]', 'The majority of thyroid nodules do not cause any symptoms. However, some produce extra thyroxine, which can cause symptoms of hyperthyroidism as thyroid hormone levels go out of range.', 'Thyroid nodules may be associated with iodine deficiency (rare in the United States, more common in many regions of Europe), overgrowth of normal thyroid tissue (thyroid adenomas) or Hashimoto’s disease, among other conditions.[40][41]', 'A thyroid nodule may also be a sign of thyroid cancer. However, most thyroid nodules are benign (non-cancerous growths). It is estimated that only two to three out of 20 thyroid nodules are cancerous.[42]', 'If a thyroid nodule is non-cancerous (benign) and not causing any symptoms, treatment may not be necessary. A doctor may simply opt to perform regular examinations and thyroid function tests to monitor its progress. Large nodules, and those that cause symptoms, may be removed surgically or treated with radioactive iodine (if they are producing thyroxine).[43]', 'Thyroid cancer', 'Thyroid cancer is relatively rare, but rates seem to be increasing. It is thought that this is due to advances in technology which allow medical practitioners to detect small thyroid cancers that may previously have gone unnoticed. Most cases of thyroid cancer are treatable and can be cured, allowing those affected to live a normal life.[44][45]', 'Early symptoms of thyroid cancer are rarely noticeable. However, in some cases, firm, painless nodules may be noted. Later symptoms may include rapid growth of a goiter, throat hoarseness or pain that does not go away, difficulty swallowing or breathing, pain in the front of the neck and an unexplained cough.[45][46][47]', 'There are four main types of thyroid cancer:', '\nPapillary (the most common type)\nFollicular (the second most common type)\nMedullary (rare, may run in families)\nAnaplastic (rare, an aggressive type of thyroid cancer)\n', 'Treatment depends on the type of thyroid cancer and may involve full (or, in rare cases, partial) removal of the thyroid gland during thyroid surgery, radioactive iodine therapy, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Levothyroxine is prescribed to prevent hypothyroidism after treatment, and is taken for life.[45]', 'Thyroiditis FAQs', 'Q: Is there a special thyroid diet?\nA: There is no specific thyroid diet that is recommended for people affected by thyroid disorders. A healthy, balanced diet is generally sufficient. It is not advisable to take special supplements, including iodine preparations, without first consulting a doctor.', 'Some foods and supplements can, however, interfere with the absorption of levothyroxine, so those taking this medication should keep in mind the following:', '\nAfter taking calcium-rich foods or supplements, wait four hours before taking levothyroxine\nAfter taking iron tablets, wait two hours before taking levothyroxine\nWait as long as possible after taking levothyroxine before eating soya or soy products\n', 'In addition, kelp and iodine supplements should be avoided unless otherwise recommended by a healthcare provider, as they can potentially aggravate thyroid disorders. A healthy, varied diet usually provides sufficient amounts of iodine. In many countries, where the normal diet contains too little iodine, table salt is iodized, meaning it has iodine added to it, to help prevent iodine deficiency from occurring.', 'Vegetables of the Brassica family, such as cabbage, broccoli and kale, may be implicated in the development of a goiter in some people, but only in very rare cases where consumption is extremely high. It is not a problem under normal dietary conditions.[48]', 'Q: What is thyroid hair loss?\nA: This is the phrase used to describe the loss of hair that may occur in severe, prolonged hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. The hair loss tends to affect the entire scalp, as opposed to small areas, and the hair may appear sparse. There may also be loss of eyebrow hair. Thyroid hair loss is unusual in mild thyroid disorders.', 'The hair typically grows back once the thyroid disorder has been successfully treated. However, this may take a few months, and regrowth is not always complete.[49] Partial hair loss is listed as a possibility during the first few months of treatment with levothyroxine.[50] In rare cases, antithyroid drugs may also be associated with hair loss.[49]', 'Q: What precautions need to be taken with the thyroid in pregnancy?\nA: Normal levels of thyroid hormone in an expectant mother are essential for the healthy development of the baby. People with pre-existing thyroid conditions may need to adjust the dosage of their medication during pregnancy, with regular thyroid function tests to ensure that their thyroid hormone levels are within the optimal range.', 'In some parts of the world, such as Germany, pregnant women may be encouraged to take iodine supplements to compensate for deficiencies in the soil and the lack of fortification of food products. A doctor will be able to advise on whether supplementation is necessary. For more information, see the thyroid and pregnancy resource.', 'People who develop symptoms of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism while pregnant need to seek immediate medical care. If symptoms of postpartum thyroiditis are present after the delivery of the baby, the mother should consult with a doctor. Postpartum thyroiditis may be mistaken for postpartum depression.[9]', 'Q: Can thyroiditis cause cancer?\nA: While thyroiditis itself does not cause cancer, some types of thyroiditis, e.g. Hashimoto’s disease, may be associated with an increase in a person’s risk of developing thyroid cancer and certain other types of cancer.[51][52] It is advisable to speak to a doctor about any cancer concerns you may have.', 'Q: Can thyroiditis recur?\nA: Yes, thyroiditis can come back or return, meaning that the condition can occur more than once. A person may also experience repeat episodes of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism as a result of some types of thyroiditis.', 'Q: Can thyroiditis cause a sore throat?\nA: Yes, a sore throat can be a sign of some types of thyroiditis, such as subacute thyroiditis and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. See the dedicated sections above for more information.[53][54]', 'Q: Can thyroiditis cause swollen lymph nodes?\nA: Swollen lymph nodes in the neck can be a sign of thyroiditis that is autoimmune in nature, e.g. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, as well as in acute infectious thyroiditis. However, swollen lymph glands can also be a sign of many other conditions. If you have swollen lymph nodes and other signs of a thyroid problem, it is advisable to consult a doctor.[55][56]', 'Q: Can a thyroid nodule cause weight gain?\nA: Most thyroid nodules themselves do not affect a person’s weight. However, a thyroid nodule can be associated with Hashimoto’s disease, which is a thyroid condition that can lead to weight gain and other symptoms of hypothyroidism.', 'Q: Do I have thyroiditis?\nA: If you think that you might have thyroiditis, try using the Ada app to find out more about your symptoms, and consult a doctor.', '', '\n\nNHS Choices. “Thyroiditis.” 26 September, 2014.

['Tonsillitis'],"['Tonsillitis is an inflammatory condition of the tonsils. It can be either caused by infection with bacteria or viruses. A sore throat and swallowing difficulties are among the main symptoms. Usually, tonsillitis is a temporary condition which lasts for about a week. Anti-inflammatory medicines (such as ibuprofen) are helpful in reducing pain and swelling. Bacterial infections might need treatment with antibiotics. Proper treatment usually leads to total recovery, but can take up to 10 days.']","['Typical symptoms are a sore throat, swelling and pain when swallowing. The lining of the throat may be red with yellow or white patches. Some people also develop headache and a fever. Some people may develop also a rash, muscle pain or belly pain. These symptoms should be reviewed by a doctor. Rare but serious symptoms include drooling, difficulty breathing and swelling of the neck. These symptoms are signs of a complication and should be reviewed urgently by a doctor.']",,"['The choice of treatment mostly depends on the cause (i.e. whether bacterial or viral). Anti-inflammatory medicines (such as ibuprofen) are helpful in reducing pain and swelling. Many people also eat cold, soft food to reduce their symptoms. If the condition is caused by bacteria, the treatment may involve antibiotics. Surgical removal of the tonsils may be required if the infections are persistent or recurrent.']"
['Trachelectomy'],"['A trachelectomy, sometimes called a cervicectomy, is a surgical procedure used to treat early-stage cervical cancer. The definition of a radical trachelectomy – the most common form of this procedure – is the removal of the cervix and part of the vagina. The ovaries and the uterus are left in place, with the uterus connected to the vagina by an artificial band.[1] The doctor may also remove the lymph nodes near the cervix. A simple trachelectomy, which is less often performed, removes only the cervix.', 'Trachelectomy compared to other surgeries', 'A trachelectomy is one of several common surgical procedures used to treat cervical cancer. The method selected depends on multiple factors, including a woman’s age, desire to maintain fertility and the cancer’s stage of development. Non-surgical treatments include radiation and chemotherapy, both of which include a risk of possible side-effects.', 'Trachelectomy vs. hysterectomy', 'A trachelectomy is an alternative to a hysterectomy, which removes both the uterine body and the cervix. In some cases, a hysterectomy will also remove the fallopian tubes, ovaries, some surrounding tissue, the nearby lymph nodes or part of the vaginal canal. A person cannot become pregnant following a hysterectomy.[2] While a hysterectomy is the most common surgical procedure used to treat cervical cancer, a trachelectomy may be more appropriate in the early stages of the cancer, as it is able to preserve a person’s fertility.[3]', 'Trachelectomy vs. conization (cone biopsy)', 'Both of these procedures can help treat early-stage cervical cancer, but a radical trachelectomy is more extensive. A radical trachelectomy removes the entire cervix and part of the vagina, whereas a conization (cone biopsy) removes only a cone-shaped portion of the cervix containing the cancer cells. A loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) is similar to a cone biopsy, and is performed with an electrified wire loop.[4] A simple trachelectomy removes only the cervix, and in some ways is more similar to a large conization.[5]', 'Trachelectomy vs. pelvic exenteration', 'During a pelvic exenteration, the cervix, ovaries, vagina, lymph nodes, lower colon, bladder and rectum are removed.[4] This major surgical procedure is typically reserved for recurrent or very advanced cancers in the pelvic area. These may include cancers of the female reproductive organs and colorectal cancer, if it has spread.[6]', 'Non-surgical alternatives to a trachelectomy', 'Radiotherapy is a very common non-surgical treatment option. It can be used to treat cervical cancer of different stages, with the decision hinging on factors, such as the desire to retain fertility and the likelihood of complications. In some cases, radiotherapy will be used in combination with chemotherapy – which is known as chemoradiotherapy – or in combination with surgery.', 'Trachelectomy vs. radiotherapy', 'Radiotherapy uses high-energy X-rays to destroy cancerous cells. It can be delivered either externally, using a large, specially designed machine which beams X-rays into the pelvis, or internally, whereby a radioactive tube is placed inside the vagina, adjacent to the tumor.[7] Generally, a combination of the two methods is used. Radiotherapy may involve a variety of side-effects, including the risk of infertility. For this reason, a trachelectomy may be preferred by women for whom fertility is a concern. Radiotherapy is rarely used alone; in most cases, it is used in combination with chemotherapy.', 'Trachelectomy vs. chemoradiotherapy', 'Chemoradiotherapy is radiotherapy and chemotherapy used in combination. This treatment method can help to remove the cancer and lessen the chances of it recurring.[8] Radiotherapy is administered in the manner described above, while chemotherapy uses cytotoxic drugs administered intravenously to destroy cancer cells.', 'Trachelectomy and fertility', 'Women who wish to preserve their fertility may opt for a trachelectomy over a hysterectomy. Since the uterus remains intact after a trachelectomy, pregnancy can still occur. Roughly 97 percent of people who have undergone trachelectomy surgery, eventually return to a normal menstrual cycle. However, doctors may advise delaying any attempt to conceive for approximately two years.[9]', 'Conception may be difficult. The risk of miscarriage among people who have had a trachelectomy is significantly higher than the norm, and any fetus carried to term must be delivered by caesarian section (C-section).', 'Trachelectomy procedures', 'Trachelectomy surgery is carried out in a hospital, under general anesthetic. It may be performed either vaginally or abdominally: vaginal surgery is the most commonly performed method, though abdominal surgery may be more appropriate for people with larger cancerous lesions.[10]', 'Abdominal trachelectomy may be performed by hand, or be laparoscopic or robotically assisted. Laparoscopic surgery is less painful, with a shorter recovery time and a lower risk of infection, though it also increases the risk of damage to the surrounding organs and the urinary tract. Robotically-assisted trachelectomy takes longer to perform, but has a shorter recovery time, with less potential for blood loss and fewer possible complications. As a trachelectomy is not a common surgical procedure, it is often performed at specialized gynecological centers.[11]', 'Trachelectomy recovery', 'Recovery time and the potential for side-effects depend on the method used in performing the trachelectomy. Most people recover in a hospital at first, and most take medications for pain management and the avoidance of infection or blood clots.', 'In general, people are advised to get plenty of rest and avoid heavy exertion. They should not have sexual intercourse or place anything in the vagina, such as a tampon. They should also avoid bathing while seated, and avoid excessive strain during a bowel movement. After several weeks – and when they are no longer taking pain medication – they may resume driving a car.', 'It is important that people avoid taking aspirin while recovering from a trachelectomy, as it may increase the risk of bleeding.[12]', 'Depending on the type of surgery performed, people will receive different recommendations for taking care of the wound. In all cases, they should inspect the wound regularly for any signs of infection such as redness, separation, swelling or drainage.', 'After returning home from the hospital, individuals may need another person to assist them with their daily activities. Loose clothes and underwear, as well as sanitary pads for bleeding and discharge may also be advised.', 'If a person experiences a high fever (above 100.4°F/38°C), excessive bleeding, abdominal or chest pain, foul-smelling vaginal discharge, fainting, or difficulty breathing or urinating, they should contact a doctor.[12] People experiencing any symptoms that may be linked to a trachelectomy can also carry out a symptom assessment using the free Ada app.', 'Risks and side-effects of trachelectomy', 'A trachelectomy is a major surgical procedure that comes with inherent risks. Though it offers a way to preserve a person’s fertility during cervical cancer treatment, pregnancy will have a higher risk of miscarriage and other complications. Other risks or side-effects may include:[12]', '\nInfection or bleeding\nScar tissue, which may increase the risk of infertility or uterine infection[13]\nBlood clotting\nDamage to the urinary tract or nearby organs\nHernia or blocked bowel\nDifficulty urinating or urinary incontinence\nVaginal discharge\nPainful intercourse\nIrregular or painful menstrual cycle\nSwelling of the vulva or exterior genitals\nNumbness of the thighs\nLymphedema (when lymph fluid collects in the limbs) or lymphocele (when it collects in the abdomen) due to lymph node removal\n', 'Women are advised to talk to a doctor about any complications of a trachelectomy they may be experiencing. Additionally, the Ada app can be used to carry out a symptom assessment.', 'Trachelectomy FAQs', 'Q: Is a trachelectomy painful?\nA: A trachelectomy is performed under general anesthetic, while a person is unconscious. As a result, the procedure itself will not be painful, but there may be some pain or tenderness around the location of the wound after the procedure, as well as a general feeling of achiness or exhaustion. While still in hospital, pain relief will normally be supplied.[14] Pain during intercourse and a painful menstrual cycle are also possible complications of a trachelectomy. Talk to a doctor if these complications occur.', 'Q: Is it possible to have a trachelectomy after a hysterectomy?\nA: Yes, it is possible to have a trachelectomy after a hysterectomy. This is usually necessary when the retained cervix, sometimes termed the cervical stump, is at risk of symptoms or disease following the initial hysterectomy. It is estimated that new cervical symptoms will arise in around one quarter of women who undergo a hysterectomy.[15]', 'Q: What is the difference between a simple trachelectomy and a radical trachelectomy?\nA: A radical trachelectomy is the most commonly performed type of the procedure, involving the removal of the cervix and a portion of the vagina. A simple trachelectomy, on the other hand, removes only the cervix.', '', '\n\n“Cervical Cancer Treatments.” Healthline. Accessed: August 1, 2017 ↩\n\n“Cervical Cancer – Surgery.” WebMD.

It is caused by a small, temporary blockage in a blood vessel in the brain. The symptoms last less than a hour in most cases, but can last up to 24 hours. Common symptoms include a loss of vision, slurred speech and weakness of the face, arm or legs. Treatment aims to prevent a further TIA and stroke by thinning the blood and managing conditions which increase the risk of having a stroke. Although a TIA itself does not cause permanent damage to the brain, it is a warning sign that a stroke may occur in the near future. People who have had a TIA should discuss steps to prevent strokes with a doctor.']","['The symptoms of a transient ischemic attack may be slightly different from person to person, but are always short-lived.

Women older than 40 years of age are most commonly affected by this condition. The condition is characterized by attacks of sudden, sharp, shooting pain in some parts of the face. It is most commonly one-sided, around the eye, cheek, jaws or the lower parts of the face and triggered by movements like smiling, chewing and more. The diagnosis is mostly made based on the symptoms and physical examination. Treatment involves medication to reduce the pain, and, if applicable, surgery. Although the pain can be difficult to control, many people find relief with a combination of therapies.']","[""The typical symptom is a very strong, sharp and electric pain of the face. This typically comes from the ear and spreads around the eye, and over the cheek, jaw and chin. This pain is usually only present on one side of the face, though it can occur on both sides in some cases. The pain tends to come in short-lived, 'electric shock'-like bursts. Talking, smiling, chewing, light touch on the face, swallowing and kissing can trigger the pain, though some people have pain without any trigger at all.

['Ulcerative Colitis (UC)'],"['Ulcerative colitis (UC) is one of the two main forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The other is Crohn’s disease. Ulcerative colitis is a fairly common condition: approximately 907,000 people in the U.S. are believed to be affected.[1]', 'The term colitis refers specifically to inflammation in the colon, or large intestine. In UC, inflammation occurring in the colon and/or rectum causes small ulcers to develop on the lining of the affected area, which may bleed and produce pus. Over time, the inflammation can permanently damage the mucosal (top) and submucosal (second) layers of intestinal tissue that line the colorectal area. This results in a variety of intestinal symptoms, including diarrhea and cramping. In addition, UC may also lead to problems in other body systems, either as a direct result of intestinal dysfunction, or due to more widespread effects of inflammation.', 'Ulcerative colitis is a lifelong (chronic) condition which requires regular medical attention. After diagnosis, a person may need to adapt their lifestyle to accommodate their treatment needs, which will vary according to a number of factors, including the individual’s age, the severity of their condition, and any other medical conditions they may have.']","['A person who is affected by ulcerative colitis may experience a wide range of possible symptoms, to varying degrees of severity, including:', 'Intestinal symptoms', 'Symptoms which are directly related to one’s intestinal health, such as:', '\nDiarrhea; possibly featuring blood, mucus or pus\nRectal pain\nAbdominal pain and cramping\nUrgency to defecate\n', 'Extraintestinal manifestations', 'Symptoms related to a person’s overall level of health and/or symptoms which affect other areas of the body.

The scope of symptoms depends on what section of the colon the inflammation reaches. For this reason UC can be divided into the following subtypes:[2]', 'Proctitis', 'This type of UC only affects the rectum. This is the mildest type of UC, as the colon itself is generally able to function as normal. Symptoms are usually directly related to defecation, including diarrhea, tenesmus (a sensation of urgency without defecation) or, in some cases, constipation. Most people with proctitis will pass blood or blood stained mucus from the rectum.', 'Proctosigmoiditis', 'Inflammation occurs in the rectum as well as the sigmoid colon - the final section of the colon which adjoins the rectum. The symptoms are similar to those of proctitis, although constipation is much less likely. Further health complications are significantly less likely to develop from proctosigmoiditis, compared to cases where a greater intestinal area is affected.[3]', 'Distal colitis', 'Also known as left-sided colitis, distal colitis affects the the left side of the colon, the sigmoid colon and the rectum. This is the most common form of UC, and recent treatment approaches have focused on devising medications that target the distal portion of the colorectal area.[4] Distal colitis can cause pain on the left side of the abdomen, as well as the symptoms listed above.', 'Pancolitis', 'Also known as total colitis or universal colitis, pancolitis affects the entire colorectal area. Symptoms may include severe abdominal pain and cramping, as well as frequent episodes of diarrhea, often accompanied by blood, mucus and pus. Fever, weight loss and other systemic health complications may also be present, as pancolitis can impact the colon’s ability to take in nutrients, compromising a person’s overall health.[5]', 'Extensive colitis', 'This is a form of UC in which the majority of the colon is affected, but not the entire colon; the part of the colon directly adjoining the small intestine is not affected. The symptoms, treatment and outlook for extensive colitis are almost identical to those of pancolitis.', 'Fulminant colitis (rare)', 'UC can also be classified according to its severity, with fulminant colitis being one of the rarest and most severe forms. Fulminant colitis usually affects people who have already been diagnosed with another, less severe form of UC.[6] Symptoms include severe pain and cramping, intense and protracted episodes of diarrhea, and bleeding.', 'Immediate medical attention is needed if fulminant colitis occurs, as life-threatening complications like toxic megacolon can occur if it is left untreated.[7]', 'Symptoms: flare-ups', 'Not everybody will experience all of the possible symptoms of UC. People with ulcerative colitis often find their symptoms vary over time, and that they experience periods of:', '\nFlare-ups, in which the inflammation is active, new damage occurs to the intestinal tissue and the individual experiences additional symptoms or a worsening of symptoms.\nRemission, in which the inflammation is inactive, their intestinal tissue can begin to heal and symptoms may be absent or mild enough not to interfere with day-to-day routine.\n', 'Flare ups can occur despite treatment for UC. The symptoms of a flare-up vary between people, depending on factors like the type and severity of UC, as well as how a person defines a period of remission.', 'Frequent or prolonged flare-ups of UC may increase one’s likelihood of developing related health complications. People who are in remission are usually advised to contact their healthcare professional if they suspect the beginnings of a flare-up, so that a specific treatment plan can be devised.', 'In severe flare ups the following additional symptoms may occur:', '\nShortness of breath\nFast or irregular heartbeat\nHigh temperature\n', 'These symptoms require immediate medical assessment.']","['UC is understood to result from an inappropriate immune response, although the exact cause for this response is not fully understood, and is likely to vary between individuals.

['Unstable Angina Pectoris'],"['Unstable angina, also known as unstable angina pectoris, is a medical emergency with sudden chest pain or tightness that worsens over a short period of time. Although it is not a heart attack, the symptoms are very similar, and is a warning that a person may have a heart attack in the near future. The symptoms are usually not predictable and often do not improve with rest. It occurs when the flow of blood and oxygen to the heart is reduced. Hardening and narrowing of the heart blood vessels due to atherosclerosis is the most common cause of stable angina. It is more common in older adults, smokers, and people with high blood pressure or high blood cholesterol levels. Treatment involves short term treatments to reduce pain and relax the blood vessels of the heart, and long-term medications and lifestyle changes to reduce the chance of having a heart attack in the future. With good management, many people learn to manage their symptoms. However, without treatment, the underlying cause may get worse and eventually cause a heart attack.']","[""The typical symptom of angina is a chest pressure or pain that radiates to the left arm, back, jaw or neck. There may also be sweating, shortness of breath and nausea and vomiting. The symptoms of unstable angina often come on quickly, and may have no predictable trigger.

Some people find that using GTN spray or tablets (glyceryl trinitrate) don't help to improve their symptoms.""]",,"['Treatment of unstable angina involves short-term measures to reduce pain and long-term measures to reduce the risk of a heart attack. People with chest pain should take GTN (spray, tablet or capsule) under the tongue. If the pain continues or gets worse, the person needs to urgently go to the emergency department. If there are warning signs that a person is at very high risk of a heart attack, emergency angiography could be needed, and a stent (a small wire tube) can be placed to open up any blockages in the blood vessels. Long-term treatment for unstable angina often involves medications to thin the blood, to control blood pressure and to reduce cholesterol levels. An exercise program (cardiac rehabilitation) may be helpful to improve heart function. Eventually, a procedure to open the narrowed heart blood vessels with a stent, or even bypass surgery may be needed to prevent a heart attack.']"
['Upper Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage'],"['Upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage is a medical condition in which heavy bleeding occurs in the upper parts of the digestive tract: the esophagus (tube between the mouth and stomach), the stomach or the small intestine. This is often a medical emergency. It occurs when the lining of these organs is damaged, for example by ulcers, tears, or if a blood vessel becomes weak and bursts. This condition is more common in elderly people and people with other medical conditions, such as liver conditions or blood clotting disorders. The symptoms might differ depending on the cause of the bleeding but often include vomiting blood and passing dark tarry stools. An endoscopy (camera through the mouth to look at the esophagus, stomach and small intestine) is done to confirm the diagnosis and stop the cause of the bleeding. Treatment involves replacing fluids and blood loss and controlling the bleeding. This condition can be prevented by treating the condition causing the bleed. The outcome after an upper gastrointestinal bleed depends on the amount of blood loss, and whether the bleeding can be controlled.']","['Common symptoms include vomiting blood or vomit which has a coffee-ground appearance. Some people may pass dark, tarry bowel motions. Additional symptoms depend on the amount of blood lost and may include bright red bowel motions, a loss of energy, paleness, fast pulse, dizziness, confusion or even loss of consciousness. Symptoms of the condition causing the bleeding may also be present.']",,"['The most important steps in treatment are to stabilize people who have symptoms due to severe blood loss and to find and stop the bleeding as soon as possible. This often includes blood transfusions, fluids and medicines through a drip (intravenously) to control blood pressure and replace lost blood. The bleeding can often be stopped through endoscopic methods. If that is not successful, surgery might be needed. Treatment of the underlying illness is necessary after the person is medically stable.']"
['Urinary Incontinence (UI)'],"['A person who is affected by urinary incontinence (UI), loses control of their urinary sphincter, the two muscles which control the passage of urine into the bladder, resulting in an involuntary leakage of urine.', 'UI is a symptom of other conditions, rather than a medical condition in its own right. People develop UI for a variety of reasons. It is generally associated with conditions which affect people in later life, such as prostate problems in men and the menopause in women.', 'Normal urinary function is controlled by the brain, which sends signals to the muscles that control the urine flow, in particular the pelvic floor muscles. Urine is produced by the kidneys. It contains the waste products from the body — including toxins, salts and water — that collect in the blood. Urine travels from the kidneys via the ureters (these are the connecting tubes between the kidneys and the bladder) to the bladder where it is stored until urination. In people with UI, the brain’s process of sending a signal to the bladder to release the urine can become compromised.', 'This causes a person to be mentally unprepared for a sudden leakage of urine. The muscles in the bladder may also lose their functionality. This renders the bladder physically unprepared to contract and relax as needed in order to store urine effectively.', 'People affected by UI often experience a poorer quality of life than continent people. This is because the condition usually impacts significantly upon an individual’s daily routine. In severe cases, UI can necessitate taking time off work and may cause physical sexual dysfunction due to an inability to control the timing of urination — as well as inspiring feelings of embarrassment and distress.[1]', 'However, in most cases, UI can be alleviated with correct management and/or treatment methods. Treatments include learning behavioral techniques and following an exercise program to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles, called Kegel exercises. In cases where an initial treatment plan does not alleviate UI, supplementary surgery may be considered. Alternatively, a long-term strategy for minimising the day-to-day impact of UI can be devised.']","['People affected by urinary incontinence (UI), experience loss of control over their urinary system. This can result in many different kinds of difficulties related to urinating, ranging from involuntary leakage to becoming unable to fully empty the bladder during urination.', 'UI can be transient:[2] a short-term or temporary problem which clears up on its own after the underlying cause, for example, a urinary tract infection, is resolved. However, UI can persist indefinitely.', 'Ongoing cases of UI are described as chronic[2] and can be the result of long-term conditions which affect the production of urine and/or the urinary system, such as diabetes. Chronic UI can last indefinitely if left untreated, so it is important for anyone affected by UI to seek medical guidance.', 'The most common types of UI are stress incontinence, i.e.placing stress on the bladder during involuntary physical activities, such as sneezing or laughing causes an involuntary release of urine, and urge incontinence, which is a sudden and uncontrollable need to urinate.

Doctors often use a mnemonic — DIAPERS[3] — to explore the possible causes of transient UI and rule out a diagnosis.', 'Transient UI may be triggered by:', '\nDelirium\nInfection\nAtrophy (when the pelvic floor muscles weaken due to underuse)\nPharmaceuticals\nExcess urine output\nRestricted mobility\nStool impaction\n', 'A person can be affected by several causes of transient UI simultaneously. In cases where UI may be caused by multiple factors, treating all the causes will maximise the chances of alleviating the UI. Pharmaceuticals which can cause UI principally do so by relaxing the bladder, increasing fluid retention, or inhibiting bladder contractions.[4] Medications which are often associated with the condition include anti-hypersensitives, pain relievers, psychotherapeutics (muscle relaxants) and others, such as antihistamine.', 'If none of the causes specified in the DIAPERS mnemonic are present, the doctor will begin to investigate other causes of UI, dependent on the specific symptoms of the individual.[2]', 'Stress urinary incontinence', 'Stress urinary incontinence is one of the two most common types of UI — the other being urge urinary incontinence. Stress incontinence is not related to feeling stressed. It occurs when the urethral sphincter, the pelvic muscles that support the bladder and control the progress of urine into the urethra, weakens. The urethral sphincter ceases to function to prevent the flow of urine into the bladder and when the bladder is put under sudden pressure, this results in involuntary leakages of urine.', 'Activities which may cause leakage of urine with stress incontinence include:', '\nCoughing\nSneezing\nLaughing\nExercise\nHeavy lifting\n', 'People with stress incontinence usually experience small amounts of urinary leakage at intervals over the course of the day.

UI associated with prostate surgery generally goes away with correct management and/or treatment, as the recovery period progresses.', 'For more information about the prostate and conditions that affect it, see this resource on enlarged prostate.']",
['Urinary Incontinence (UI) Treatment'],"['A person who is affected by urinary incontinence (UI) loses control of their urinary sphincter — made up of the two muscles, which control the passage of urine into the bladder — causing involuntary leakage of urine. UI is a symptom of other conditions rather than a medical condition in its own right. People develop UI for a variety of reasons. It is often associated with conditions which affect older people, such as prostate problems in males and menopause in females.', 'Normal urinary function is controlled by the brain, which sends signals to the muscles in the bladder to hold or release urine, in particular the pelvic floor muscles. Urine is produced by the kidneys. It contains waste products from the body — including toxins, salts and water — that are filtered from the blood. It is transported from the kidneys and excreted (expelled) from the body via the urinary system. Urine travels from the kidneys via the ureters - connecting tubes between the kidneys and the bladder - to the bladder, where it is stored until urination.', 'There are two principal circumstances which lead to a person developing UI:', '\nThe brain’s process of sending a signal to the bladder to release the urine can become compromised. This results in a person having limited control over the muscles in their urinary system.\nAlternatively, a local muscle fragility can cause UI. If the functionality of all, or part(s), of the muscles in the urinary system is compromised, the bladder may become unable to contract and relax as needed in order to store and release urine effectively, resulting in UI.\n', 'In most cases, UI can be treated effectively. Treatment options for UI are chosen based on the type of incontinence affecting the person and might range from exercises for strengthening the pelvic floor muscles to surgery, if necessary.', 'Read more about Urinary Incontinence »']",,,"['UI can be treated or managed successfully through a variety of treatment options, including:', '\nNon-surgical options, including using absorbent products, undertaking exercise programmes such as Kegel exercises, behavioral treatments and non-surgical procedures, such as botox injections or electrical nerve stimulation.\nMedications\nSurgery\n', 'The type of treatment and management guidelines for treating UI will depend on factors such as the type of UI a person has and whether they are biologically male or female.', 'Often, successful treatment of UI will involve a combination of treatment options. For example, treatment for stress incontinence may require medication, Kegel exercises and/or behavioral change therapy. In the event that these methods are not sufficient to treat the UI, surgery may be considered.', 'Non-surgical options', 'Non-surgical treatments for UI include:', 'Absorbent products', 'Absorbent products may be used in the treatment of all types of UI. During the period when appropriate treatment for UI is being planned and before it has had a chance to work, many people use them to manage involuntary leakages of urine.', 'Most absorbent products for UI are single-use, disposable items. Environmentally-friendly items such as cotton pads that can be laundered and reused are also available. The doctor will recommend suitable products for an individual, depending on the frequency and quantity of their urinary leakage.', 'Absorbent products for UI include:', '\nPads\nPanty-liners\nAdult diapers\nPlastic-coated underwear\nDrip-collectors that fit over the penis\n', 'Absorbent products alone are not sufficient to manage UI, and most people stop needing to use them as their treatment plan becomes effective. However, in cases where UI persists despite treatment or returns after surgery, the use of absorbent products may form part of a long-term strategy for the management of UI.', 'Physical exercise programs (such as Kegel exercises)', 'Kegel exercises are a commonly prescribed physical exercise program for treating urinary incontinence in women in particular and are recommended in the treatment of stress incontinence, urge incontinence and mixed incontinence.', 'The three primary areas which are strengthened by Kegel exercises are:', '\nThe bladder, which holds the urine\nThe pubococcygeus which supports the bladder and rectum\nThe sphincter, which helps open and close the urethra\n', 'Kegel exercises should be practiced as directed by a doctor in order to keep the pelvic floor muscles, which control the bladder and urine flow, operational. The movements generally involve tightening and relaxing the vaginal and rectal muscles.', 'It can take three to six weeks to feel the benefits of starting a program of Kegel exercises, with daily practice. After starting a program, it is advisable to demonstrate how one performs one’s exercises to a doctor or nurse during a check-up to ensure that the proper forms of the Kegel movements are being practiced.', 'Other forms of exercise which may be helpful in the treatment and prevention of UI include:', 'Pilates', 'Pilates is a form of exercise which can target specific areas of the body in order to improve physical strength and flexibility. Apparatus, like resistance bands and balls are often used in order to help ensure that the correct area of the body is being targeted during the routine.', 'When performing pilates to improve the pelvic floor muscles, a small pilates ball is often placed between the knees or thighs to ensure the attention is focused on the muscles in this area. Some people find it helpful to join a specialized pilates class, but it is also possible to practice the routines that help lessen UI using equipment at home.', 'Kyphosis exercises', 'Exercises that are designed to prevent an excessive curve of the lumbar region or mid-back, also called kyphosis or a dowager’s hump, have proven beneficial for alleviating the symptoms of UI in both women and men.', 'These exercises improve posture, which can relieve pressure on the urinary system and also strengthen the pelvic floor muscles. Exercises which involve squatting or stretching the mid-back over a foam roller are particularly helpful.', 'Behavioral treatment', 'Behavioral treatment can be particularly helpful in treating urge and/or stress incontinence and can be prescribed on its own or in combination with other options, such as medication and/or surgery. Behavioral treatment involves learning psychological techniques which can help prevent involuntary urinary leakage. It has been found to be significantly more effective than oral medication alone in overcoming UI.[1]', 'Behavioral techniques which can be helpful in the management of UI principally involve bladder training. The affected person will learn techniques aimed at emptying the bladder completely and lengthening the intervals between toilet trips. The training also involves scheduling toilet trips, rather than waiting until one feels a sense of urgency.', 'Other behavioral techniques include:', '\nRelaxation exercises\nBreathing exercises\nLimiting liquid intake before bed to avoid wetting the bed or waking up recurrently during the night. This needs to be discussed in detail with a doctor to ensure that dehydration does not occur.\nAvoiding alcohol\nAvoiding caffeine\nAvoiding acidic foods\nIncreasing exercise\n', 'Non-surgical procedures', 'There are several minimally invasive non-surgical treatments, such as stimulating the muscles in the bladder with electricity using a probe inserted into the vagina, or inserting bulking agents into the urethral wall. This means they are considered preferable to surgical treatments by some patients.', 'These techniques have a lower long-term efficacy rate than surgical methods. However, for people who are unable or unwilling to undergo surgery and for whom medications and/or behavioral therapies have not successfully treated UI, these options can provide a helpful alternative.', 'Interventional procedures for UI can involve:[2][3][4][5]', 'Bulking agents. Substances designed to provide structural reinforcement will be injected into the urethral wall in order to strengthen the urethra. This can help a person regain control of the operation of their urinary sphincter and their ability to hold urine in the bladder. Bulking agents are usually composed of synthetic materials, silicone particles or collagen.', 'Electrical nerve stimulation (ES). This treatment involves inserting a probe into the vagina and/or anus to deliver electrical stimulation to the muscles in the urinary system in order to strengthen them. ES is mostly prescribed for women with UI and has not been found to be as effective for men.', 'Laser treatment. This is a fairly new treatment for UI. It makes use of an erbium‐doped yttrium‐aluminum‐garnet (Er:YAG) laser, which has previously been used successfully in the field of plastic skin reconstruction. This technique has principally been used to treat UI in women. The Er:YAG laser is applied to the supportive tissues in the pelvic area to tighten them. This has been found to be an effective treatment for stress urinary incontinence only, with effects lasting up to one year. Laser treatment for UI has not been found effective for other types of urinary incontinence.', 'Botox. It is possible to strengthen and rejuvenate the muscles in the urinary system with the use of botox injections (intradetrusor botulinum toxin). Although this is not a first-line treatment for UI, it may be prescribed as an alternative if a person with urge incontinence does not find relief using oral medication.', 'Medications', 'This list includes the principal medications which are used in the treatment of UI:', 'Alpha blockers', 'These medications are usually prescribed specifically for men who are affected by overflow incontinence. They function to relax the muscles in the neck of the bladder and the muscle fibers in the prostate. This makes it easier to empty the bladder.', 'Anticholinergic drugs (muscarinic antagonists)', 'These medications target neurotransmitters, which send signals from the brain to the body, and function to block involuntary muscle movements. In people with UI, this can serve to calm an overactive bladder. Anticholinergics may be especially helpful in treating urge incontinence.', 'Topical estrogen', 'Women who are affected by urge incontinence may benefit from toning the tissues in the vaginal and urethral areas. Vaginal creams, rings or patches containing low-dose, topical estrogen can be helpful for this purpose. Taking the hormone orally, however, can worsen UI and is not recommended.', 'Beta-3 adrenergic agonists', 'These medications are primarily prescribed to treat urge incontinence. They work by relaxing the muscles in the bladder, which increases its capacity. In some cases, they can also help a person to empty their bladder increasingly effectively during urination.', 'Surgical treatment options', 'Surgery is very rarely considered as a first-line treatment for UI. It is typically only considered in cases where non-invasive methods such as Kegel exercises, behavioral therapies and/or medications and interventional therapies have been prescribed and have not been effective, or when other therapies would not be useful in targeting the underlying cause of UI.', 'Most surgery for UI is designed to treat stress incontinence. Most of the surgical procedures for UI have the same goal, which is bringing the bladder back to its original position.', 'For this reason, surgery for UI is mainly performed on women. Women are most often affected by UI that results from factors like hormonal changes, pregnancy and the anatomy of the pelvis changing with age. All of these factors are likely to damage the pelvic floor in a way which causes the bladder to sink and leave its original position.', 'There are several types of surgical procedure that can be performed to treat UI, most of which are carried out under general or local anesthetic as in-patient procedures by surgeons called urologists and who specialize in problems related to the urinary system. In cases when surgery for UI is to be performed on a woman, the urologist will work closely with a gynecologist.', 'The appropriate kind of surgery will be decided by the doctor on a case-by-case basis. The types of surgery with the best success rates are the sling procedure and bladder neck suspension surgery.', 'Sling procedure', 'This procedure is primarily carried out on women as a treatment for stress incontinence.', 'A mesh product called a urinary sling is inserted into the pelvic area to restore the urethra to its correct position and full functionality. One advantage of the sling procedure is that it can be performed under local or local anesthetic, although general anaesthetic will be required in some cases, depending on the extent to which the urethra has moved from its correct position.', 'During the procedure, a small incision will be made in the pelvic area, usually in the abdomen, where the pelvic area meets the top of the thigh or the vagina. The urinary sling will be inserted. The urinary sling works by providing support to the urethra, which it restores to its correct position. In the recovery period, the body’s tissues will begin to grow around the mesh, reinforcing the corrective effects of the procedure.', 'Men can also undergo the sling procedure. A variety of urinary sling products are specifically designed for men; these are called male urinary slings. Men often choose the sling procedure for UI where possible to avoid surgical options that involve the insertion of a mechanical device, like an artificial urinary sphincter.[6] (See the section on Artificial urinary sphincter.', 'A further advantage of the sling procedure is that correct urinary function is generally restored to the affected person within hours. Additionally, recovery times are usually short, minimizing the need to refrain from normal daily activities.', 'Bladder neck suspension', 'Bladder neck suspension surgery is solely used to relieve stress incontinence in men and women. The procedure involves restoring a deteriorated bladder to its previous position within the pelvis.', 'Bladder suspension surgery is used to treat UI arising from:', '\nMuscle deterioration\nChanges to the body caused by pregnancy and related internal damage\nMenopause and associated complications\n', 'Bladder neck suspension surgery is highly successful at relieving UI for a prolonged period of time in most cases, but the effects of the surgery are not always permanent, and UI eventually returns in a small number of cases.', 'Artificial urinary sphincter', 'This is primarily used to relieve stress incontinence in men and is rarely recommended for women.', 'The procedure involves the insertion of a device called an artificial urinary sphincter which consists of a reservoir which holds the urine securely in the abdomen, and a circular cuff which releases a flow of urine when the device is activated.', 'This is not a popular type of surgery for UI. In addition to experiencing pain and bleeding in the postoperative period, many people find that artificial urinary sphincters have a tendency to stop working. Further surgery is then needed to remove the device.', 'Prolapse surgery', 'In some women, a vaginal prolapse can put pressure on the bladder, causing UI. Prolapses occur when weakness in the vaginal walls causes the formation of a bulge which protrudes beyond the pelvic area. They can be triggered by activities and physical states which place exertion on the pelvic area, such as heavy lifting, pregnancy or straining repeatedly to pass a bowel movement. The protruding lump will usually come out of the vagina, and can contain the bladder, bowel, uterus or all three of these body parts.', 'Surgery to correct a vaginal prolapse can restore the prolapsed parts to their correct anatomical position, and can thereby relieve pressure on the bladder and restore normal urinary function.', 'However, vaginal prolapse surgery alone cannot treat any case of UI which is triggered by any additional or alternative causes to a vaginal prolapse. Furthermore, complications from the surgery, such as an infection at the surgery site where the wound is healing, can also trigger UI or cause it to return.[7]', 'Weight loss', 'It is very common for UI to co-occur with obesity. The risk of developing UI among those affected by obesity is greatly increased, the higher a person’s body mass index (BMI) is: each 5-unit increase in a person’s BMI correlates to an increased risk of developing UI, which can range from 20 to 70 percent. The link between UI and obesity is believed to relate to excess weight contributing to increased abdominal pressure, which can disrupt normal urinary function.[8]', 'In obese people, losing weight can be an effective way to reduce the impact of UI and should be considered before surgery as part of an initial treatment plan. Losing five to ten percent of one’s total body weight can have a similar effect to other non-surgical treatments for alleviating UI in obese people.', 'Treatment options for weight loss for treating UI in obese or overweight people may include:[9][10][11][12]', 'Lifestyle changes', 'Eating healthily and increasing the amount of physical activity can help a person to lose weight, which can reduce the symptoms of UI. Stopping smoking, staying hydrated, consuming increased quantities of fresh fruits and vegetables and reducing consumption of sugary foods can increase a person’s metabolic rate and also contribute to weight loss, which can help to treat UI.', 'Liquid-diet weight reduction program', 'A low-calorie liquid diet (of around 800 calories per day or less) with increased exercise has been found to be effective at inducing weight loss and reducing symptoms in women with UI. However, major changes to a person’s diet, especially a significantly reduced calorie intake, should only be carried out under the supervision of a nutritionist, in order to ensure that they are suitable and safe for the affected person.', 'Weight reduction surgery', 'Also called bariatric or metabolic surgery, weight loss surgery is a major surgical procedure which can help very overweight people to lose weight rapidly. It may involve having a gastric band, gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy: each of these options aims to shrink the capacity to of the stomach so that the affected person feels full sooner, reducing their food intake and ultimately losing weight. In UI caused by obesity, weight reduction surgery may help a person lose weight to the point where they are no longer affected by UI more quickly than is usually possible by means of diet or exercise alone.']"
['Urinary Tract Infection'],"['Urinary tract infection is an infection of the urinary system which is caused by bacteria infecting any part of the urinary system, which includes the urethra (the tube between the bladder and the skin), the bladder, ureters (tubes between the kidneys and the bladder) and the kidneys. Infection of the bladder is called cystitis. Infection of the kidneys is called pyelonephritis. The infection is non-transmittable. It usually develops when bacteria from the bowel or the genital region ascend through the urethra to the bladder or kidney. Symptoms include fever, pain in the lower abdomen, frequent urination in small portions and an odd smell to the urine. With antibiotic treatment, most people recover quickly.', 'Feeling unwell?

['Uveitis'],"['Uveitis is a broad term used to describe an inflammation of the uveal tract of the eye.', 'The uveal tract is composed of:', '\nThe iris: the part of the eye making up a person’s eye color\nThe ciliary body: a small muscle behind the iris\nThe choroid: a layer of tissue between the retina (a light sensitive inner coat of the eye), and the sclera (the dense connective tissue that forms the white of the eye)\n', 'The uveal tract is an area containing a large proportion of the eyes’ blood vessels.[^1]', 'Uveitis typically causes pain and blurred vision, but can, in the majority of cases, be successfully treated through the use of medication. However, if left untreated, the condition can lead to complications including glaucoma, cataracts and possible blindness.[1]', 'Uveitis is a relatively rare condition, affecting roughly 2-5 people in every 10,000. It can affect people of any age, though is most common in those aged 20 to 59.[2]', 'Types of uveitis', 'There are various types of uveitis, each classified according to the part of the uveal tract the inflammation affects:', '\nAnterior uveitis: Affecting the front section of the uveal tract. This is the most common form of the condition and is typically caused by infection, inflammatory diseases or trauma, e.g. blunt force to the eye.\nIntermediate uveitis: Affecting the middle section of the uveal tract. Typically caused by diseases such as sarcoidosis.\nPosterior uveitis: Affecting the rear of the uveal tract. This is a rare form of the condition.\nPanuveitis: When the condition affects the entirety of the uveal tract. This is the most severe form of the condition, which can lead to serious damage to the retina.\n', 'Each type of uveitis is also classified by the frequency at which it occurs.

An autoimmune disorder is characterized by the body’s immune system producing antibodies to attack its own tissues, with the result, in the case of uveitis, of causing inflammation. The exact reason as to why the immune systems of some people behave this way is unknown."", 'It is also believed that individuals with inflammatory diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis, sarcoidosis and inflammatory bowel diseases, e.g. ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease, are more likely to develop uveitis.', 'Infection', 'Bacterial, fungal or viral infection can cause uveitis in some cases. Possible infection types include toxoplasmosis, herpes simplex, herpes zoster, cytomegalovirus, gonorrhea, tuberculosis and Lyme disease.', 'Injury', 'If the eye suffers an injury, this can also lead to uveitis.']","['Treatment for uveitis is aimed at reducing pain and inflammation, repairing any loss of vision and attempting to treat any underlying causes. The chosen treatment route will depend upon the specific type of the condition being experienced and what is causing it.', 'In most cases, medication will be the primary treatment method, but in some cases surgery may also be required.', 'Treatment will usually include:[4]', 'Steroid medications', 'The use of steroid medications (glucocorticoids, hormones based on cholesterol) is common in the treatment of uveitis. Steroids can be administered in different ways, with the chosen method depending on what type of the condition is being experienced.', '\nSteroid eye-drops: Typically used in the initial treatment of anterior uveitis when it is not caused by an infection. The severity of the condition will decide the prescribed dose and how often the drops should be administered. It is important to continue using the eye drops even after symptoms have disappeared to prevent recurrence.\nSteroid injections: Typically used in cases of intermediate or posterior uveitis or if steroid eye drops have proven unsuccessful. The injection is administered to the outside of the eyeball (periocular). A doctor will administer the injection using local anesthetic to minimize any pain or discomfort as much as possible. Generally, only one injection will be needed when the symptoms are at their worst.\nSteroid tablets: The strongest form of steroid medication, usually administered if other options have not worked. Side-effects can be severe, so steroid tablets will generally only be used if there is a risk of permanent damage to the eyes. It is important to continue using the tablets as prescribed even after symptoms have disappeared to prevent recurrence. The severity of the condition will determine how long an individual’s steroid tablet course will have to last, which could be anywhere between a number of weeks and,  in much rarer cases, up to a number of years.\n', 'Mydriatic eye drops', 'Mydriatic eye drops may be prescribed in cases of anterior uveitis, in addition to steroid eye drops. This type of medication relaxes the muscles in the eye and thereby widens the pupil of the eye, helping to relieve pain and reduce the risk of glaucoma. They can, however, lead to a temporary blurring of vision.', 'Treating infection', 'If uveitis is being caused by an infection, this may be treated using either antibiotics, antiviral medication or antifungal medication. If the condition does not improve after using these medications, immunosuppressants may be prescribed.', 'Immunosuppressants work by suppressing immune system responses, thereby disrupting the process of inflammation. There is, however, a risk of side effects.

In addition, the free Ada app can be used to carry  out a symptom assessment.', 'Surgery', 'In rare cases, surgery may be required to treat uveitis. This will typically be the case if the condition recurs frequently or if it is particularly severe.', 'The surgical procedure used to treat uveitis is called a vitrectomy. During the procedure, the substance that fills the interior of the eye, the vitreous, is removed and temporarily replaced with air, gas or a liquid substitute. Eventually, the eye will naturally replace the substance by itself.[5]', 'A vitrectomy can be carried out using either local or general (patient is asleep during the procedure) anesthetic and – like any surgical procedure – comes with some risk of complications.', 'Immunotherapy', 'In cases where other medical treatment options have been ineffective, a relatively new form of treatment called immunotherapy or biologic therapy may be prescribed. This involves the use of medications containing biological agents, i.e.natural antibodies, which can specifically target the eye area, treating the pain and inflammation associated with uveitis.', 'The types of biologic medication most commonly used to treat uveitis are called infliximab and adalimumab. Biologic medications have the potential to improve an affected person’s quality of life. However, no long-term safety data has been collected about this form of treatment yet. Immunotherapy should therefore only be undertaken accompanied by close supervision from an experienced doctor.']"

Bleeding into the brain is particularly common with late-onset VKDB.', 'If bleeding is internal, it can be extremely difficult to notice and may lead to serious complications and even death. Signs are not always obvious and may be mistaken for other conditions.[4][6]', 'VKDB is classified as one of three types according to when it develops:[5][10]', '\nEarly-onset VKDB, which develops within 24 hours of the infant being born\nClassic-onset VKDB, which develops within 2-7 days of the infant being born\nLate-onset VKDB, which develops between two weeks and six months after birth, most commonly in babies who have not been given a vitamin K shot\n', 'In addition to the symptoms listed above, signs of VKDB in babies may include:[4][5][6][7][8]', '\nPoor feeding\nLow weight or difficulty gaining weight\n', 'Good to know: Brain bleeds may cause seizures and frequent vomiting in a baby. There may also be a lump on the head that was not there before.', 'If any unusual symptoms are present or vitamin K deficiency is suspected, a medical professional should be contacted immediately.', 'To help prevent VKDB and other potential complications of low vitamin K levels, vitamin K is routinely given by injection or orally to all infants at birth, in many parts of the world.', 'Risk factors for VKDB', 'Factors that increase an infant’s chances of developing VKDB include:[11]', '\nBreastfeeding. Children who are exclusively breastfed are roughly 20 times more likely to experience VKDB. This is due to the low levels of vitamin K in breast milk compared to formula milk, as well as the low levels of bacteria that help the body synthesize vitamin K. However, breastfeeding has many other benefits, and concern about vitamin K deficiency is no reason not to do it, as the routine administration of vitamin K to newborns significantly reduces the risk of VKDB.\nPharmaceuticals. Certain medication taken by the mother can increase the chances of an infant developing VKDB. These include rifampicin, isoniazid, anticoagulants and anticonvulsant agents.\nWarm environments. Extended exposure to a warm environment can make late-developing VKDB more likely. Late-developing VKDB usually peaks at around 3-8 weeks.\nLiver disease. There is increased risk if an infant has an unsuspected liver disease, especially alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency.\nMalabsorption. An inability to absorb vitamins due to factors and conditions such as cystic fibrosis, celiac disease and long-lasting diarrhea.\n', 'Prevention and treatment of VKDB in infants', 'A vitamin K supplement should be given to the infant as soon as VKDB is suspected. In severe cases, fresh frozen plasma, a blood product containing coagulating properties, may also be administered. If an infant has lost a large amount of blood, a blood transfusion may also be necessary.', 'To help prevent VKDB from occurring, a vitamin K supplement in the form of phytonadione is routinely given, with parental permission, to infants after birth in many parts of the world, including the United States and United Kingdom. It is sometimes called “the vitamin K shot”, but may be administered orally. The procedure is considered safe by healthcare professionals.[1][4][12][13][14]', 'Vitamin K deficiency causes and risk factors', 'A vitamin K deficiency can occur in people of any age, but newborn infants are particularly at risk. Vitamin K deficiency is most likely to result from a lack of vitamin K reaching the fetus before birth and the lack of vitamin K in breast milk.', 'Other risk factors for a vitamin K deficiency include:[1][15]', '\nLiver disease\nConditions that affect the body’s ability to absorb vitamin K, such as celiac disease, Crohn’s disease and tropical sprue\nBiliary tract disease\nMalnutrition\nCertain drugs, such as coumarin anticoagulants, cholestyramine, salicylates, rifampin and barbiturates\n', 'It should be emphasized that a vitamin K deficiency in healthy adults is rare due to the vitamin’s presence in a variety of food sources, notably green leafy vegetables, oils and grains.', 'Vitamin K deficiency diagnosis', 'Diagnosing a deficiency of vitamin K will typically begin with a physical examination by a doctor.', 'If a deficiency is suspected, the next stage of diagnosis will normally be blood tests. A blood test can reveal the level of prothrombin, a clotting agent in the blood, which will be lower than average in the case of a vitamin K deficiency.', 'However, as low levels of prothrombin can also be symptomatic of other conditions, the diagnosis will generally be confirmed with a vitamin K injection. If symptoms subside following the injection, the diagnosis of vitamin K deficiency can be confirmed.[16]', 'If you think that you or a loved one might have a vitamin K deficiency, start a free symptom assessment using the Ada app.', 'Vitamin K deficiency prevention', 'Most healthy adults are able to prevent a deficiency of vitamin K by maintaining a diet containing foodstuffs which are rich in the vitamin, such as:', '\nGreen leafy vegetables, such as kale, chard, watercress and spinach\nOils, such as olive, cottonseed and soya bean\nGrains, such as rye grain, spelt and buckwheat\n', 'In some cases, a vitamin K supplement may be recommended for those at risk of developing a vitamin K deficiency.', 'Vitamin K deficiency treatment', 'The appropriate treatment method for a vitamin K deficiency depends on the severity of the condition, particularly the severity of the associated bleeding, and its underlying cause.', 'If bleeding reaches life-threatening levels, fresh frozen plasma will be administered. In other cases, or after fresh frozen plasma has been administered, a vitamin K supplement will be administered to the person, usually intravenously or into the muscle.[1][17]', 'Vitamin K deficiency FAQs', 'Q: What does vitamin K do?\nA: Vitamin K plays an important role in keeping the bones, heart and brain healthy. It is also essential for normal blood clotting, known as coagulation; low levels of vitamin K can cause a person to bleed excessively. For this reason, it is sometimes called “the blood clotting vitamin”.[18]', 'Q: What is the most common cause of vitamin K deficiency?\nA: Vitamin K deficiency is most likely to occur in newborn infants, as a result of low levels of the vitamin being transferred from the mother to the baby during pregnancy, naturally low levels in breast milk, and the baby’s body experiencing difficulty making the vitamin on its own.', 'However, most newborns are given a vitamin K supplement after birth to avoid complications. Vitamin K deficiency is rare in adults, but can be caused by malnutrition, certain prescription medication and conditions that lead to malabsorption. For more information, see the section on causes above.[15]', 'Q: Why is vitamin K deficiency rare in adults?\nA: Low levels of vitamin K are rare in healthy adults because it is easy to obtain sufficient quantities of the vitamin by eating a balanced diet, and the body is able to produce some vitamin K on its own.[15]', 'Q: What foods are high in vitamin K?\nA: Examples of good sources of vitamin K include:[18]', '\nGreen leafy vegetables like spinach, kale and lettuce\nOther vegetables like brussels sprouts, cabbage and broccoli\n', 'Q: Does vitamin K deficiency cause bruising?\nA: Vitamin K deficiency can cause a person to bruise easily. However, there may be other causes of bruising. Vitamin K deficiency can also cause heavy bleeding.', 'If you think that you or a loved one might have signs of vitamin K deficiency, try using the Ada app to find out more about your symptoms.', 'Q: Can vitamin K deficiency cause anemia?\nA: Vitamin K deficiency in itself does not cause anemia. However, the heavy bleeding that can be a symptom of the deficiency, may sometimes be associated with anemia.

['White Blood Cell Count'],"['Healthy blood contains a certain percentage of white blood cells (WBCs, leukocytes or leucocytes) which, as part of the body’s immune system, help the body fight infection.[1] A white blood cell (WBC) count measures the amount of white blood cells in a sample of a person’s blood. The number of white blood cells in the body differs between individuals or at different ages in their lives. The normal range for a white blood cell count in a healthy adult is between 4,000 and 11,000 WBCs per microliter (μl or mcL) or cubic millimeter (mm3) of blood, though this may differ between males and females, and healthy children and young people usually have more.', 'To measure the number of white blood cells in a person’s body, a doctor will order a white blood cell count, often as part of a complete blood count (CBC) test. A low white blood cell count can indicate conditions including infections, inflammation, certain cancers, HIV/AIDS, and others, making it an important diagnostic test. Aside from these conditions, a person’s white blood cell count can indicate their immune system activity, response to cancer treatment and overall health.', 'White blood cells (WBCs)', 'There are several kinds of white blood cells (WBCs), including neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes and basophils. Each variety plays a different role in protecting the body from foreign pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites. White blood cells also defend the body from allergens, mutated cells, such as cancer, and foreign matter, such as splinters, and remove dead cells, old red blood cells and other debris.[1]', 'A white blood cell count checks both the overall levels of white blood cells in the blood, as well as the overall proportion of different types of white blood cells.', 'Low white blood cell (WBC) count', 'The threshold for a low white blood cell count (leukopenia) varies between individuals and cases, but is generally considered to be anything lower than 4,000 white blood cells per μl of blood in an adult.

Get a free symptom assessment with the Ada app.', 'Q: What is hematology?\nA: Hematology (alternatively spelled haematology) is the branch of medicine concerned with blood and the various disorders and conditions involving blood. This includes the study of problems with white blood cells (WBCs), red blood cells (RBCs), bone marrow and platelets, which may include conditions such as anemia, leukemia, myeloproliferative disorders and neutropenia.[4]', 'Q: Are there any types of cancer associated with white blood cells (WBCs)?\nA: Yes, there are two main types of cancer associated with WBCs: leukemia and lymphoma. Leukemia is a cancer found in the blood and bone marrow which is caused by the rapid production of abnormal WBCs. These abnormal cells impair the body’s ability to fight infection, as well as the ability of bone marrow to produce platelets and red blood cells.[9] There are four main types of leukemia: acute myeloid, chronic myeloid, acute lymphocytic and chronic lymphocytic. Lymphoma, the second type of cancer involving WBCs, occurs when lymphocytes (small leukocytes that are part of the immune system) behave abnormally and collect in certain areas of the body. Lymphocytes can collect anywhere in the body, most commonly in the lymph nodes in the neck, armpits and groin.[10] Treatment options are available for both types of cancer.', 'Q: What is the relationship between bone marrow and white blood cells (WBCs)?\nA: Bone marrow is the soft tissue inside the bones. It contains stem cells which can develop into WBCs, RBCs and platelets.[10]', '', '\n\n“Health Library: Facts About Blood.” Johns Hopkins Medicine.

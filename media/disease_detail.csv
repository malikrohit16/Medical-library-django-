,,,,,,,,,,What is Achilles tendonitis?
,,,,,,,,,,What is Achilles tendonitis?,"Achilles tendonitis, also known as Achilles tendinopathy or Achilles tendinitis, is a condition affecting the Achilles tendon. The Achilles tendon is a large tendon which attaches the calf muscles to the bony heel of the foot. When the tendon becomes inflamed or damaged, usually through overuse, a person has developed Achilles tendonitis and will experience pain.","This condition mostly affects athletic and active people, especially mature adults between the ages of 30 and 50. The incidence rate is around five to 10 people in 100,000.[1]","Treatment is usually simple and mainly involves resting from the specific exercises that cause the pain. This will often be supplemented by regenerative/rehabilitative stretching exercises, most often tailored to the person and taught by a physical therapist. Most people recover from Achilles tendonitis without any lasting effects.",Symptoms of Achilles tendonitis,The most common symptom of Achilles tendonitis is pain in the back of the foot and heel. The onset of pain may be sudden or gradual.[2],Symptoms of Achilles tendonitis include:[3][4],"
Pain at the back of the foot and heel when moving the ankle
Pain when pointing the toes, or pushing off from the toes
Pain which becomes worse after exercising
Stiffness along the back of the foot and heel, especially with the first steps in the morning
Swelling and tenderness in the back of the foot and heel
Thickening of the tendon
Bone spurs in cases of insertional tendonitis (see insertional Achilles tendonitis)
","People experiencing possible symptoms of Achilles tendonitis should consult a doctor. In addition, the free Ada app can be used to carry out a symptom assessment.",Causes of Achilles tendonitis,"The Achilles tendon is a large, thick tendon that attaches the calf muscles to the bony heel of the foot. This tendon bears the weight of the body when pushing off from the toes in the act of walking or running.",Achilles tendonitis most often occurs when the tendon becomes inflamed or damaged through overuse. Risk factors for developing Achilles tendonitis include:[3][4][5],"
Suddenly increasing the amount or intensity of exercise
Not stretching out the calf muscles properly after exercise
Running or exercising to excess
Running on hard surfaces
Jumping repeatedly during exercise or sports
Manual labour which puts stress on ankles and feet
Having bone spurs (osteophytes) which rub against the Achilles tendon
Not wearing sufficiently supportive shoes for exercise
Having flattened arches in the foot
","Although Achilles tendonitis is commonly referred to as tendonitis, the condition does not always involve inflammation of the tendon. Over time, tendons ‒ including the Achilles tendon ‒ degenerate. When this happens, they become damaged and lose elasticity. Pain which is caused by this progressive degeneration is called Achilles tendinosis, or sometimes Achilles tendinopathy; however tendinopathy is technically an umbrella term for tendonitis and tendinosis.[5]",Noninsertional Achilles tendonitis,"55 to 65 percent of Achilles tendonitis cases are classified as noninsertional Achilles tendonitis: the fibers in the center of the Achilles tendon begin to degenerate or become inflamed, swell and become thicker.[4][6]",Insertional Achilles tendonitis,"Insertional Achilles tendonitis occurs when the Achilles tendon degenerates or gets inflamed at the point where the tendon attaches, or inserts, to the heel bone. Bone spurs, projections that develop along bone edges, also known as osteophytes may form in cases of insertional Achilles tendonitis.[4][7]",Achilles tendon rupture,"A complication of Achilles tendonitis can be an Achilles tendon rupture. A rupture occurs when a tendon tears, partially or completely, after being stretched beyond its capacity. Achilles tendonitis can increase the chances of a rupture occurring.[8][9]",Around 80 percent of Achilles tendon ruptures occur during exercise and while playing sports. People most commonly develop the condition between the ages of 30 and 50.[1],"The antibiotic class fluoroquinolones which, among many others, includes ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin, may cause Achilles tendon rupture, even after a short course. Corticosteroid injections into the heel can also increase a person’s risk of developing Achilles tendon rupture.[10][11][7]",Diagnosis of Achilles tendonitis,"Achilles tendonitis can usually be diagnosed based on the symptoms, following a physical examination of the ankle and tendon. Other tests may be needed in more serious cases of Achilles tendonitis to establish the extent of the problem. These may include:[3][4]","
X-ray, which does not produce images of tendons but can reveal hardening (calcification) of tendons, as well as bone spurs
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, which uses magnets and radio waves to look inside the body to produce detailed images of tendons, muscles and other soft tissue and may be of use when planning surgery
",Treatment of Achilles tendonitis,Most people with Achilles tendonitis will be treated with non-surgical options.,"Rest is vital to allow the Achilles tendon to heal. Any exercise or activity that causes pain should be stopped until the pain subsides. Depending on the severity of the tendonitis, this could take six months or longer. In severe cases, an immobilization boot may be necessary for a few weeks to reduce stress on the foot. An immobilization boot, also known as a walking boot or walking cast, is a removable alternative to a plaster cast, often used to aid healing after fracturing a bone or bone surgery. A splint worn at night has also been shown to temporarily reduce pain.[4][5][12]","Physical therapy and exercises are recommended to help strengthen the calf muscles, which reduces stress on the Achilles tendon. Training programmes that focus on a particular type of muscle exercise, known as eccentric training, have been shown to help particularly well in cases of tendonitis. A common exercise is standing on a step and slowly lowering the heel, though a physical therapist can advise on the most appropriate exercises and demonstrate how to perform them. 60 to 90 percent of people who use eccentric exercises to strengthen their Achilles tendon report pain relief.[4][12][13][14]","Ice, in the form of ice in a bag or an ice pack, can be applied to the affected area which may help reduce swelling. However, recent studies suggest ice may be more effective at treating inflammatory conditions such as paratenonitis, a condition where the tendon sheath around a tendon becomes inflamed, than tendonitis itself.[3][5][14]","Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, can also help provide pain relief. If the tendon is not inflamed, painkillers such as paracetamol may be  effective at relieving pain, too. NSAIDs should not be taken for long periods of time, as this can result in the development of side effects, such as stomach upsets and damage to the tissue of the gastrointestinal system. If needed, doctors can recommend appropriate painkillers for long-term use.[4][15]","Studies have shown that glycerol trinitrate ointment, applied daily as a patch for six months, reduces pain and can help improve outcomes for people with Achilles tendonitis.[12]","Shock-wave therapy is a procedure that increases blood flow to an injured area, speeding up the healing process by using a device to pass low-energy sound waves into the body. Studies have shown the treatment to be promising for treating Achilles tendonitis.[14][16]","If Achilles tendonitis injuries take a long time to heal, a treatment where the person’s blood is taken from the arm vein and separated to extract platelet-rich plasma, which is then injected back into the tendon site, may be an option. However, while the evidence suggests few harmful side effects, there is still discussion around the treatment’s effectiveness.[13]","Good to know: Corticosteroid injections may help to reduce inflammation and pain on a short term basis, but are not generally recommended for Achilles tendonitis, because they make the tendon more likely to rupture, especially if multiple, recurrent injections are given.[7]",Surgical treatments for Achilles tendonitis,"Where Achilles tendonitis fails to respond to non-surgical methods after six months, surgery may be necessary. There are a number of surgical procedures available, depending on the nature and location of the injury. A surgeon will recommend the best option. Possible procedures include:[4][17]","
Debridement and repair, which removes damaged parts of the tendon. This may be performed if less than 50 percent of the tendon is damaged
Debridement with tendon transfer may be performed when more than 50 percent of the tendon is damaged. The remaining tendon is supported with other tendon tissue, often taken from the long tendon of the big toe
Gastrocnemius recession, which lengthens the calf muscle to place less stress on the Achilles tendon
Bone spur removal, in cases of insertional tendonitis. Artificial anchors may be implanted to attach the tendon to the bone
",Prevention of Achilles tendonitis,There are a number of ways to help prevent Achilles tendonitis:[5],"
Taking care to warm up the body gently but properly, with light exercise before running or sprinting, such as brisk walking for a few minutes
Gradually increase the duration and intensity of exercise
Cool down after exercise, such as by changing to (brisk) walking for a few minutes after running or sprinting
Stretching fully after exercising
Strengthen calf muscles to reduce stress on the Achilles tendon
Use supportive footwear while exercising or playing sports
","If pain does occur, it is wise to rest the foot until receiving a definitive diagnosis and treatment plan to prevent a more severe injury developing. If a person experiences Achilles pain for the first time or it persists, they should seek medical treatment.",FAQs for Achilles tendonitis,"Q: Can Achilles tendonitis cause foot pain?
A: Yes. Achilles tendonitis causes pain in the back of the foot and the heel. See the section on Symptoms of Achilles tendonitis.",Other ways to refer to Achilles tendonitis,"

,,,,,,,,,,What is acne vulgaris?
,,,,,,,,,,What is acne vulgaris?,"Acne is a skin condition in which oil (sebum) and dead skin cells clog the pores (hair follicles), causing pimples or spots to develop. Acne differs from regular pimples in that it tends to consist of multiple pimples at once and is usually recurrent. Acne is quite common, especially among males, with most people experiencing it at least once. It tends to affect people between the ages of 12 and 25, though is most typical during the teenage years. In most cases, it will improve later in adulthood. Acne may cause scarring of the skin, but generally causes no long-term health problems. If you think that you may be experiencing acne, a symptom assessment using the Ada app may be able to help. Download it for free or find out more now.",Causes of acne vulgaris,"Pimples occur when dead skin cells and oil clog the pores of the skin. As more oil builds up behind the blockage, the pore becomes inflamed, and the pimple becomes painful and swollen. Acne typically appears for the first time during adolescence, triggered by a group of hormones known as androgens which begin to circulate in the body during puberty.","Acne will often improve in early adulthood, but can persist longer. The condition affects teenage boys more often than girls, but, in adults, women develop it more commonly than men. There are a number of triggers that can make the development of acne more likely, including:[1]","
The use of the progesterone-only contraceptive pill
The hormonal changes triggered by menstrual periods
Some types of makeup
Picking or squeezing existing pimples
Sweating heavily
Humid weather
Tight clothing, headbands or collars, for example
Some medicines. Do not stop taking medication which is causing acne before talking to a doctor
Steroids, including anabolic steroids and steroid creams used to treat eczema
",Genetics may also play a role in the development of acne; a person’s family history is relevant when visiting a dermatologist.,Symptoms of acne vulgaris,"Typical symptoms of acne include skin pimples, cysts and nodules. The pimples are often on the face, although the shoulders, back, chest and other body parts can also be affected. The skin around and over these pimples is sometimes red and sore. With time, the affected skin may become darker or scarred. If you are experiencing possible symptoms of acne, the Ada app can help you to find out what the problem is with a symptom assessment. Download the free app or find out more about the how it works.",Types of pimples,There are six main types of pimples:[2],"
Blackheads: Small black or yellowish bumps.
Whiteheads: Small white or yellowish bumps, usually firmer than blackheads.
Papules: Small red bumps that can be sore.
Pustules: Similar to papules but will have a white spot in the center caused by a buildup of pus.
Nodules: Large hard bumps that are typically painful.
Cysts: Large lumps filled with pus that may be painful. A severe form of acne that may cause scarring.
",Acne vulgaris diagnosis,"A doctor or dermatologist will diagnose acne following a skin examination, taking note of where the acne is located and its severity. These factors are important in determining how the condition should be treated.",Professionals typically use a grading system to categorize acne:[2],"
Grade 1: Mild acne, probably limited to blackheads and whiteheads.
Grade 2: Moderate acne with papules and pustules, mostly confined to the face.
Grade 3: Moderately severe acne affecting the face, back and chest. Papules and pustules will be present, and inflamed nodules are possible.
Grade 4: Severe acne, with a large number of painful papules, pustules and nodules.
",Acne vulgaris treatment,"The treatment of acne depends on the severity of the condition. To treat very mild acne, simple steps such as washing the face and hair regularly, but not excessively, to remove excess oil, avoiding heavy, oily creams and cosmetics and maintaining a healthy diet may suffice.","If, however, the acne is severe, or mild acne does not improve after following the steps outlined above, a number of different topical and/or oral medications are available. Some are available over the counter whereas others may require a prescription.",Some of the most common topical acne medications include:[1][3],"
Retinoids: These medications are effective at unblocking pores and can help to reduce inflammation. They are often used early on in the treatment process and generally require a prescription. Types include adapalene, tretinoin and isotretinoin, which all come with various brand names.
Benzoyl peroxide: This is a topical treatment option which can be bought from pharmacies without a prescription. It is effective at clearing the skin of bacteria, unblocking pores and reducing inflammation. In some instances, this type of medication may be used in combination with antibiotics, which will typically require a prescription. Always read the enclosed information leaflet carefully before beginning treatment.
Topical antibiotics: These medications work by killing the bacteria growing inside the pores. They are therefore effective at reducing inflammation, but have limited effectiveness at unblocking pores, meaning they are generally ineffective at tackling blackheads or whiteheads. A prescription is necessary.
Selective aldosterone antagonists: Can be taken orally or applied topically. Examples include spironolactone.
",Some of the most common oral acne medications include:,"
Antibiotics are effective at reducing inflammation and killing the bacteria that can contribute to acne. Tetracycline-based antibiotics are the most commonly prescribed for treating acne.
The combined pill, which contains estrogen and progesterone, or substitutes, may be effective at treating acne in women whose acne seems to be caused by abrupt hormonal changes.
Isotretinoin, part of the retinoids group, can be very effective at treating even severe acne, though is generally only used once all other treatment options have been explored. This is due to the risk of disturbing embryo development in pregnancy and other possible side-effects that isotretinoin may cause, which include headaches, joint and muscle pain.
","Acne treatment can take a number of weeks to show results, with most treatments showing good results by roughly week six. It is therefore important to continue treatment, even if the acne is showing no signs of improvement.",Acne vulgaris prevention,"There are several ways to help prevent the development of acne. Not all preventive measures will work for all people, however, and no technique is guaranteed to be effective.",Techniques for helping to prevent acne include:[4][5],"
Keeping the face clean: The face should be cleaned roughly twice daily using warm water and a mild soap in order to remove impurities and dead skin cells form the surface. Avoid washing the face too often, however, and do not use a harsh soap or cleanser.
Moisturize: Moisturizing can help to keep the skin moist and prevent it from peeling. Products with “non-comedogenic” on the label should not block the pores and thus also not contribute to acne.
Diet and exercise: Eating a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, and low in fats and sugars may help to control acne. Similarly, getting plenty of exercise may also help to prevent acne outbreaks, as well as promoting general good health. After exercising, be sure to wash away any residual sweat, as this can contribute to acne.
Avoid makeup: Limiting makeup use may help to prevent an acne outbreak. Any makeup that is used should be oil-free and non-comedogenic.
Shampoo often: Wash the hair regularly with shampoo. If the hair is particularly oily, use shampoo daily.
Don’t touch: Avoid the temptation to touch the face throughout the day and be sure not to squeeze, pick or pop pimples; this will allow the acne to heal naturally.
Avoid excessive sunlight and tanning beds: Too much exposure to the sun and the use of tanning beds may damage the skin and is therefore not recommended.
Over-the-counter medication: Many anti-acne products are available over the counter from pharmacists and general stores. As well as controlling outbreaks after they have occurred, these products may help to prevent an outbreak from happening in the first place.
",Acne vulgaris FAQs,"Q: Will acne return after treatment?
A: Once treatment has been stopped, it is normal for acne to return. For this reason, many people choose to carry on with maintenance treatment, sometimes for as long as four or five years. This is usually done using a topical retinoid or benzoyl peroxide.[1]","Q: Can acne ever pose a serious risk to your health?
A: Acne does not pose a direct health risk, but can, in some cases, cause permanent scarring of the skin. If your acne does not respond to treatment, you may be referred to a hospital specialist to explore further options. If scarring has already occurred, laser treatment or a chemical peel, among other options, may be recommended.[1]","Q: Are acne scars permanent?
A: Scarring can result from any type of acne, though is most commonly associated with severe forms of the condition. If left untreated, acne scars are likely to be present for life. Treatment options, however, are available and include cosmetic surgery, laser treatment and dermabrasion. A doctor, specifically a skin specialist or dermatologist, will be able to help outline treatment options and advise on the most appropriate method for each individual.[6]","Q: What is cystic acne vulgaris?
A: Cystic acne vulgaris is a severe type of acne that involves the development of cysts: red, large and often painful lumps that form deep within the skin’s pores. Cystic acne is a severe form of acne that can, in some cases, lead to scarring. For this reason, it is important to visit a doctor or specifically a dermatologist if cystic acne occurs; they will be able to properly diagnose the condition and recommend treatment options.","Q: What is the difference between acne and rosacea?
A: Acne and rosacea are commonly confused conditions. Both can result in pimples, redness and swelling, and both tend to affect the face. They are, however, separate conditions that require different approaches to management and treatment. For more information on rosacea, take a look at this specialist resource from Ada.","Q: Can pregnancy make acne worse?
A: Pregnancy can trigger an acne outbreak or make existing acne worse. This is thought to be due to an increase in androgen hormones, which can make the skin oilier and lead to an increase in the size of the skin’s pores. This may not be the case for all pregnant women, however.[7]",Other names for acne vulgaris,"

,,,,,,,,,,What is acute appendicitis?
,,,,,,,,,,What is acute appendicitis?,"Acute appendicitis is an infection of the appendix – the 3 ½-inch-long pouch of tissue attached to the large intestine on the lower right side of the abdomen. This infection and the resulting inflammation can cause symptoms including pain, fever, loss of appetite and an upset stomach.","Acute appendicitis is a medical emergency because, if it is not treated, the appendix can burst and infected material can spread into the abdominal cavity. This is a life-threatening situation, and must be treated urgently with antibiotics, as well as by removing the infected appendix.","An appendectomy (surgery to remove the appendix), also known as an appendicectomy, is the most common treatment for acute appendicitis. While the appendix may play a role in young children’s immune system, it serves no known purpose in adults and can be removed via an appendectomy without harmful consequences.[1]",Acute appendicitis symptoms,"The signs and symptoms of appendicitis appear quickly, usually starting with abdominal (stomach) pain.","As acute appendicitis can lead to a burst appendix within 24 to 72 hours, it is important to seek medical attention as soon as symptoms begin to appear. The most ccommon initial symptoms include:[1]","
Pain in the upper abdomen or near the navel, starting dull and becoming sharper as it moves to the lower right-hand side. This location is most common, but pain can also occur in other parts of the abdomen
Loss of appetite
Nausea and vomiting[2]
",Other common symptoms include:,"
Fever and chills
Difficulty urinating
Difficulty passing gas
Constipation, diarrhea or alternating periods of both
Swollen belly
Severe cramps
","A person experiencing symptoms of appendicitis should seek medical attention and avoid taking over-the-counter painkillers or other medications, which could mask the symptoms and make it more difficult to diagnose. They should also avoid eating or drinking, as well as the use of home remedies such as heating pads, laxatives or enemas, as these can cause the appendix to burst.","Good to know: Symptoms of a burst appendix include intense abdominal pain in the lower right side that decreases and becomes generalized abdominal pain, accompanied by a high fever.[3]",People experiencing possible symptoms of acute appendicitis can also use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.,Acute appendicitis symptoms in children and adolescents,"Children are most likely to get appendicitis between the ages of 8 and 16.[4] Young children with acute appendicitis may have difficulty describing the symptoms they are experiencing, so it is important that parents are aware of the signs of appendicitis.","For example, even if a child is experiencing localized pain on the right side of their abdomen, they might identify the pain as affecting their entire stomach, leading parents to think their child has a different condition.[2]",The most common symptoms of acute appendicitis in children are:,"
Abdominal pain and pain with movement
Loss of appetite
Nausea and vomiting
Fever
","In older children and teenagers, the most common symptoms are similar to those experienced by adults.","Good to know: It is not uncommon for acute appendicitis in children to be confused with gastroenteritis, a common condition also known as stomach flu. A misdiagnosis can increase the risk of a burst appendix.",Acute appendicitis symptoms in pregnancy,"Identifying appendicitis in pregnant women can be difficult, as many of the symptoms are similar to the discomfort normally associated with pregnancy, such as nausea, vomiting and cramping. The appendix may also be pushed by the uterus into the upper abdomen by a few centimeters, particularly during the third trimester. In this case, pain from appendicitis may occur in the upper right side, instead of only its usual position in the lower right side.","Women in the later stages of pregnancy are difficult to diagnose with appendicitis because they tend to have unusual symptoms. These can include a sudden change in bowel habits (constipation and diarrhea), an increase in gas, and new or worsening heartburn.[2] Pregnant women experiencing possible symptoms of acute appendicitis can carry out a free symptom assesment in the Ada app.",Acute appendicitis causes,"Appendicitis is generally caused by a blockage of the appendix, which increases the pressure inside the appendix and cuts off blood flow. Inside the blocked appendix, bacteria multiply and form pus, which further damages the wall of the appendix and causes pain and irritation.","The blockage is most often caused by hardened stool, but can also be caused by tumors, scar tissue or swollen lymph nodes.[5]",Acute appendicitis vs. chronic appendicitis,"The most common type of appendicitis is acute, in which an infection causes sharp pain that rapidly develops over a period of hours. However, in rare instances, appendicitis may develop slowly over a period of days or weeks. This is known as chronic appendicitis.","The symptoms of chronic appendicitis tend to come and go, and are usually less intense than those of acute appendicitis. The symptoms resemble those of acute appendicitis, but with pain that is usually dull and achy rather than sharp.","Chronic appendicitis occurs when the inside of the appendix is partially obstructed and becomes infected, but the pressure building inside the infected, inflamed appendix dislodges the obstruction instead of causing rupture or perforation. Symptoms then subside until the appendix becomes blocked again.","As the symptoms of chronic appendicitis are similar to other chronic digestive issues, this condition is sometimes confused with ulcerative colitis (UC), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), Crohn’s disease and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).","Diagnostic techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) scans and ultrasounds can be used to diagnose chronic appendicitis, but they can make errors, and misdiagnosis of chronic appendicitis does sometimes lead to unnecessary appendectomies in a small number of cases.[6]",Acute appendicitis diagnosis,"Acute appendicitis symptoms are similar to those of other conditions, such as a urinary tract infection (UTI), bladder infection, Crohn’s disease, gallbladder issues, intestinal infection, diverticulitis or gastritis. To make a clear diagnosis, doctors will typically use a range of tests.",Tests used in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis include:,"
Physical examination of the abdomen
Rectal exam
Blood tests for signs of infection, such as a white blood cell count
CT scan
MRI
Abdominal ultrasonography
Urine test, to exclude a UTI as the cause[1]
",Acute appendicitis risks,"The most serious risk is that acute appendicitis will cause the appendix to burst (perforate), causing infected material to collect and spread to other parts of the belly. If the infection spreads widely throughout the abdomen and is not treated urgently, it could result in death.",Good to know: A burst appendix is a medical emergency requiring immediate treatment and a hospital stay.,Acute appendicitis treatment,"An appendectomy (surgery to remove the appendix), also known as an appendicectomy outside the US, is the chosen treatment method for acute appendicitis in almost all cases, as the risk of an infected appendix rupturing and causing a life-threatening infection is extremely high.[1]","Recent evidence has suggested that some cases of uncomplicated appendicitis can be treated with antibiotics instead of an appendectomy. However, this is only appropriate when the appendix has not burst or caused an abscess. An appendectomy remains the standard treatment for appendicitis.[7]",Acute Appendicitis FAQs,"Q: How can I tell if it’s appendicitis or something less serious?
A: In some ways, the abdominal pain and nausea from appendicitis can feel similar to the discomfort caused by gas, constipation, indigestion or stomach flu. However, the pain caused by appendicitis is usually localized to the lower right side of the abdomen, far more severe and tends to increase in intensity.","Pressing on the abdominal area will increase the pain from acute appendicitis, as will passing gas or belching. Acute appendicitis also usually occurs with a high fever.[8]","As acute appendicitis can progress from the first signs to rupture in 24-72 hours, it is important to visit a hospital as soon as acute appendicitis is suspected. Signs may include fever or digestive upset, combined with abdominal pain on the right side of the abdomen that becomes more intense instead of abating. Sometimes the symptoms of appendicitis do not follow a predictable pattern, though, so a person experiencing unusual abdominal pain that lasts for longer than four hours should seek a diagnosis from a doctor urgently, especially if any other symptoms are also present.","Q: Is there always a fever with appendicitis?
A: Acute appendicitis sometimes occurs without a fever.","Q: How can appendicitis be prevented?
A: There is no known way to prevent appendicitis, but it does seem to occur less commonly among people who eat a diet rich in fruits, vegetables and fiber.[9]","Q: Are there any risks associated with an appendectomy (appendicectomy)?
A: An appendectomy – the surgical procedure to remove the appendix – is generally considered routine. However, there are certain risks associated with an appendectomy, just as there is with any surgical procedure. These risks include excessive bleeding, infection, the formation of an abscess and abdominal inflammation. Before undergoing an appendectomy, be sure to discuss the possible complications with your doctor.[1]","Q: What happens if my appendix bursts?
A: As soon as the warning signs of appendicitis appear (abdominal pain, loss of appetite, nausea, etc) it is important to seek emergency medical attention to ensure the appropriate treatment is received. If this does not happen and the appendix bursts, potentially life threatening infections can result. If bacteria from a burst appendix reaches the peritoneum (the inner lining of the belly), this can result in an infection known as peritonitis. Signs of peritonitis include severe continuous abdominal pain, abdominal swelling, vomiting and fever. Another possible consequence of a burst appendix is the formation of an abscess. Both peritonitis and an abscess can be treated with antibiotics (most likely administered intravenously) but require urgent medical attention.[10]"
,,,,,,,,,,What is acute aspiration of oropharyngeal or gastric contents?
,,,,,,,,,,What is acute aspiration of oropharyngeal or gastric contents?,"Aspiration is a condition where fluids or solid particles (especially food) go into the windpipe or lungs (are inhaled or aspirated), instead of being swallowed into the esophagus and stomach. This can cause blockage of the airways and inflammation and infection of the lungs. It is more likely if there is a problem with the normal swallowing or gag reflexes. Symptoms may include coughing while eating, wheezing and shortness of breath. Toddlers and the elderly tend to aspirate more commonly, as do people who have had a stroke or brain injury, or who have other neurologic conditions. The outcome after aspirating depends on the substance aspirated, the age of the person affected and the presence of complications following the aspiration.",Risks,"This condition tends to be more common among toddlers and the elderly. Certain medical conditions, especially those which affect the ability to swallow or the gag reflex significantly increase the risk of aspiration. These include problems with the development of the airways before birth, drowsiness, sedating drugs (including anesthetics and alcohol), and after a stroke or other brain injury, among other causes.",Symptoms,"Symptoms may include a cough with eating, choking, shortness of breath, chest pain, wheezing, extreme tiredness, fever, and a blue tinge to the lips, fingers and feet.",Diagnosis,"The diagnosis is based on the symptoms, a physical examination and a chest X-ray or CT scan. Other tests that may be useful include tests of swallowing function and testing the airway mucus for bacteria.",Treatment,"Treatment depends on the severity of the aspiration. The aspirated objects or objects may need to removed by using a flexible camera to look at the windpipes. If pneumonia occurs, antibiotics might be given. In severe cases, the aspiration may cause severe damage to the lungs, and a machine to help with breathing (a ventilator) might be necessary to support breathing while the lungs recover.",Prevention,"Most people can prevent it by having a strong cough. Physiotherapy can help to develop and maintain the coughing muscles. People with difficulty swallowing should get and follow advice from a speech pathologist on foods that are safe to eat to prevent aspiration. Avoiding some behaviors, such as excessive drinking and talking when eating, may help avoid some episodes of aspiration."
,,,,,,,,,,What is acute bronchitis?
,,,,,,,,,,What is acute bronchitis?,"Acute bronchitis – also commonly called a chest cold – is a short-term inflammation of the bronchial tubes which carry air to and from the lungs. The condition’s principal symptom is coughing, which is often accompanied by wheezing, shortness of breath, fatigue and coughing up mucus.[1]","Acute bronchitis is a common condition which often develops from respiratory infections, such as the common cold or the flu. In rare cases, it can be caused by a bacterial infection. It is generally considered to be non-serious and in most cases will fade in around two weeks, though the characteristic cough may linger for longer. There is a risk that acute bronchitis will develop into pneumonia – a more serious condition.","If the condition is recurring, it may be diagnosed as chronic bronchitis, a constant irritation of the bronchial tubes that is often associated with smoking.[2] For more information, see this resource on chronic bronchitis.",Symptoms of acute bronchitis,"The most common symptom of acute bronchitis is a cough, which is typically described as dry and hacking in nature in its initial stages. As the condition develops and mucus is built up in the lungs, coughing up mucus will likely occur. This mucus may be yellow, green or clear in colour. The cough generally lasts for around two to three weeks, but can last for longer.[3]",Other symptoms of acute bronchitis include:[4],"
Sore throat
Fever
Chest congestion
Shortness of breath
Wheezing
Chills
Fatigue
","When experiencing a very high fever, persistent chills, shoulder and neck pain or if symptoms generally worsen, it is important to seek medical attention. In some cases, acute bronchitis may develop into pneumonia, a more serious condition.[5]",Causes of acute bronchitis,"Acute bronchitis is most commonly caused by a virus – often the same viruses that cause upper respiratory tract infections such as the common cold and flu. The condition can be contracted through exposure to droplets released after an infected person coughs or sneezes, with most viruses able to survive on a surface for as long as 24 hours.[6] Acute bronchitis can also be caused by bacteria, but this is far less common.",Diagnosing acute bronchitis,"In its early stages, it may be difficult to distinguish acute bronchitis from a common cold. However, in the majority of cases, a doctor will be able to diagnose acute bronchitis after performing a physical examination and inquiring about what symptoms are being experienced.","If there are difficulties in diagnosing acute bronchitis, or if the condition persists for a longer period than expected, a series of further tests may be called for:[7]","
Pulmonary function test: Used to check for signs of asthma or emphysema.
Sputum tests: Sputum, or mucus, can be tested to identify its underlying causes.
Chest X-ray: An X-ray may be useful in determining the cause of a cough and ruling out the possibility of pneumonia, whooping cough or other lung problems.
",Acute bronchitis treatment,"In many cases, acute bronchitis will require no treatment and will clear up of its own accord in two to three weeks. If the condition is particularly severe, if it lasts for longer than the norm or if a bacterial cause is suspected, however, treatment methods are available. These include:[8]","
Cough medicine: If a cough is particularly severe and affects sleep, a cough medicine may be prescribed by a doctor, or they may recommend an over-the-counter (OTC) form of cough medicine. Pain relievers such as ibuprofen and paracetamol can be taken to suppress pain.
Other medications: People with allergies, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may be prescribed a range of other medications to alleviate the symptoms of the condition.
","To manage the symptoms of acute bronchitis at home, individuals are also recommended to:[9]","
Rest: Rest is vital in order to help the immune system regain its strength.
Hydrate: Drinking plenty of water helps thin out the mucus in the chest, making it easier to cough up.
Consume hot drinks and lozenges: Drinks such as tea with honey and over-the-counter lozenges can provide some relief from certain symptoms.
Inhale steam: Steam from a hot shower or towel can help dislodge mucus and relieve symptoms.
",There are many natural products which can effectively help alleviate the symptoms of a chest cold. These include:,"
Apple cider vinegar: Raw, unfiltered apple cider vinegar helps thin the mucus in the chest, which can reduce congestion and help a person with a chest cold to breathe better. Drinking a solution of warm water mixed with two teaspoons of apple cider vinegar, two or three times a day for a week will help reduce the duration of a chest cold and strengthen the immune system, preventing future colds.
Turmeric: Tumeric, a plant and spice that grows in Southeast-Asian and Middle-Eastern countries, is very effective at reducing the symptoms of a chest cold. It contains the compound curcumin, which has antiviral, antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. Adding one teaspoon of fresh and grated turmeric, or powdered turmeric, to a hot drink several times a day or using it to flavour food can help alleviate the symptoms of a chest cold.
Ginger: Ginger has been used as a natural remedy to treat various conditions for over 2000 years and is an effective agent in reducing the inflammation in the chest caused by a chest cold. It can be added to food in its raw state, brewed as a tea or taken as supplements.
Essential oils: There are many different types of essential oils, each of which are particularly helpful with alleviating the symptoms of a different array of conditions. The most helpful essential oils for treating a chest cold include frankincense, oregano, eucalyptus, tea tree and lemon. Essential oils can be added to a hot compress, bath water, dabbed on the neck and temples or administered using a vaporiser/diffuser. When using essential oils to treat a chest cold, always consult the instructions on the packaging for the most appropriate way to apply them.
","Some herbal remedies and supplements are not compatible with underlying conditions or prescription medications. If, in addition to their chest cold, a person has a chronic (ongoing) condition and/or regularly takes any medications, they should consult their doctor before using any new natural products.",Acute bronchitis prevention,"Although it is not always possible to completely avoid the viruses and bacteria that cause acute bronchitis, there are several ways to reduce the risk of getting acute bronchitis from them. These include:[10]","
Washing hands as frequently and thoroughly as possible
Get plenty of rest
Avoid excessively touching the eyes or mouth, particularly around people with acute bronchitis
Avoid sharing things such as drinking glasses or utensils
Stay healthy with regular exercise and a balanced diet
Get vaccines for pneumonia, flu and whooping cough
",Complications associated with acute bronchitis,"When the infection spreads deeper into the lungs, there is a risk that acute bronchitis will develop into pneumonia. The symptoms of pneumonia are similar to those of acute bronchitis, but are typically more severe. If acute bronchitis is persistent or its symptoms worsen, medical attention should be sought in order to test for pneumonia. People more likely to develop pneumonia include:[11]","
Elderly people
Smokers
People with other health conditions such as liver or kidney disease
People with weak immune systems
People with pre-existing lung conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder
","Another risk factor associated with acute bronchitis is chronic bronchitis, a related condition that is permanent rather than temporary. Chronic bronchitis is often associated with smoking, but can also be made more likely by exposure to irritants in the air. A doctor will be able to diagnose chronic bronchitis.",Acute bronchitis in children,"Acute bronchitis can develop in children of any age. Premature babies and children with asthma or allergies are especially susceptible. The symptoms of acute bronchitis in children, as well as the treatment methods, are much the same as in adult cases. Parents should seek immediate medical attention when:[12]","
Breathing becomes difficult and wheezing occurs
A child struggles to talk or eat
A child experiences fever, stiffness or headaches
The lips or nails turn grey or blue
A child is dizzy, confused, faints or finds waking up more difficult than usual
Signs of dehydration, such as cracked lips, crying without tears or a dry mouth occur
A fever disappears and then returns
A child’s cough lasts for longer than three weeks
Symptoms generally worsen
","Breathing difficulties are especially likely to be apparent in younger children, especially toddlers. There may be signs that the child is having trouble breathing, including flaring of the nostrils and clenching of the muscles in the ribs.",Acute bronchitis FAQs,"Q: Is acute bronchitis contagious?
A: Yes, acute bronchitis is contagious. It is, in most cases, spread by influenza or other similar virus types. These viruses can be spread from person to person via droplets produced when an infected individual sneezes, coughs or talks. To avoid developing acute bronchitis, people should wash their hands regularly, avoid contact with infected individuals and get an annual flu shot.[13]","Q: Are there any home remedies for acute bronchitis?
A: Yes, there are a number of home remedies for acute bronchitis. Such remedies are recommended to help aid the recovery from the condition, though, if symptoms persist, professional medical attention should always be sought. Home remedies include:[14]","
Rest: Rest is key to helping the immune system recover its strength.
Herbal remedies: A variety of natural products, including drinking ginger tea and/or sage tea, can be helpful in alleviating acute bronchitis, due to their anti-inflammatory and decongesting properties.
Water: Staying well-hydrated helps thin the mucus produced as a result of acute bronchitis, meaning it is easier to expel.
Salt: Gargling with salt water may help clean away excess mucus.
Spicy food: Spicy food can help dislodge mucus and clear up the airways.
","Q: Can antibiotics be used to treat acute bronchitis?
A: As acute bronchitis is usually the result of a viral infection, it is not recommended that antibiotics be used to treat the condition. Most cases of acute bronchitis clear up of their own accord or only require pain relievers or cough medication. Unnecessary use of antibiotics can be harmful and lead to antibiotic resistance.[15]","Q: What is the difference between acute bronchitis and a chest cold?
A: There is no difference between acute bronchitis and a chest cold – they are different terms for the same condition. Acute bronchitis, however, is different to a common cold and is  characterized by its more severe symptoms and the buildup of mucus.[16]"
,,,,,,,,,,What is acute gastritis
,,,,,,,,,,What is acute gastritis,"Acute gastritis is an inflammation or irritation of the stomach lining, leading to symptoms including pain, nausea, vomiting and inappropriate feelings of satiety. This mucus layer can be damaged by overgrowth of the bacteria Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), as well as the habitual use of alcohol or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, e.g. NSAID pain relievers and aspirin.[1] A number of treatments and management strategies exist, and most cases of acute gastritis have a short recovery time of only a few days.",Acute vs. chronic gastritis,"Acute gastritis is similar to chronic gastritis, but occurs more suddenly. The symptoms and pain caused by acute gastritis set in quickly, but are usually brief, while chronic gastritis causes duller and longer-lasting pain.[2] Acute gastritis improves quickly once treatment has begun, but chronic gastritis can be linked to more serious conditions such as peptic ulcers, gastric polyps, Crohn’s disease or stomach cancer.",Acute gastritis vs. gastroenteritis,Both acute and chronic gastritis directly affect the stomach and cause nausea and vomiting. Gastroenteritis affects both the stomach and intestines and may also cause diarrhea.,Causes,"When the protective layer of mucus in the stomach is damaged, gastric acids can irritate the stomach lining. The mucus layer is often damaged by repeated use of NSAID drugs such as aspirin and excessive consumption of alcohol. H. pylori, the bacteria that causes peptic ulcers, can also cause acute gastritis, though many people have H. pylori in their stomach without experiencing gastritis symptoms. Other causes may include traumatic injury, burns or major surgery.","Though less common, acute gastritis can also be caused by digestive issues such as Crohn’s disease, viral infections, extreme stress, kidney failure or bile reflux.[3] However, gastritis caused by autoimmune conditions, such as Crohn’s disease, tends to be chronic (long-lasting), rather than acute.",Risk factors,"A variety of lifestyle and health factors increase a person’s risk of developing acute gastritis. Underlying health issues include a particular vulnerability to H. pylori infection, possibly linked to genetic factors, and being 60 years of age or older, as older people have thinner stomach linings.[4]","People with pernicious anemia/B12 deficiency, HIV/AIDS or parasitic infections are also at risk of developing acute gastritis.","Habitual use of painkillers like aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen can change the composition of the stomach lining, leaving it less protected and causing both acute and chronic gastritis. Excessive alcohol consumption is a common risk factor, as are smoking or eating spicy food.[5]
Children are less likely than adults to develop acute gastritis.",Other factors which increase a person’s risk of developing acute gastritis include:,"
Obesity
Stress
Undergoing cortisone therapy
Pregnancy
",Symptoms of acute gastritis,"Symptoms of acute gastritis can include recurring nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, a feeling of burning in the stomach and passing melena, a stool containing blood related to upper gastrointestinal bleeding; this will appear to be black and tarry.[6]","Some people also experience a feeling of fullness in the upper part of the stomach or abdomen, become full too quickly after eating, or vomit blood, which may resemble coffee grounds. Acute gastritis may occur with or without bleeding. The Ada app can help you check your symptoms.

They will also conduct a physical examination of the abdomen. Depending on these factors, a number of tests may be used for a diagnosis:","
Blood test for anemia
Stool test for the presence of blood
Testing for H. pylori: These tests may include a blood, stool or breath test.
EGD (esophagogastroduodenoscopy), also called gastroscopy or upper endoscopy: An EGD is a visual inspection of the stomach lining, performed by passing an endoscope – a long, thin, flexible tube with a lighted camera – down the throat and into the esophagus, stomach and upper intestine. The doctor can examine the stomach lining for signs of inflammation and take a small tissue sample (biopsy) for further testing. The biopsy is an additional method to test for H. pylori.[8] An EGD is more likely to be used if other test results are unusual, or if the patient is experiencing extreme fatigue and weight loss.
Upper gastrointestinal (GI) series: Also called a barium swallow, this test creates a series of X-rays of the GI tract. Swallowing a liquid containing barium coats the inside of the stomach, esophagus and small intestine to make the organs, as well as an ulcer or other abnormality, more visible by X-ray.
",Acute gastritis treatment,"The treatment of acute gastritis varies according to the cause of the irritation, and a doctor will design a treatment taking into account factors such as the patient’s age, overall health, seriousness of the symptoms and the cause of the inflammation.[9] Most cases of acute gastritis resolve themselves in a few days or weeks, typically through adjustment of diet and removal of irritating substances, but both over-the-counter and prescription medications may also be used.",Acute gastritis diet and home remedies,"People with acute gastritis should avoid irritant pain relievers and anti-inflammatory drugs, such as NSAIDs or aspirin. Patients who drink alcohol or smoke will be advised to stop. After the gastritis heals, they may be able to resume drinking small amounts of alcohol.","It is also advisable to stop eating things that irritate the stomach, such as fatty, spicy or highly acidic foods. Some people choose to reduce foods containing lactose or gluten.","Other lifestyle changes that may help include eating smaller, more frequent meals rather than larger meals, weight reduction and managing stress. Some research suggests that herbal supplements including clove, slippery elm, licorice, wild indigo and myrrh can improve digestive health and mitigate H. pylori.[10]","Most minor cases of acute gastritis will respond to these treatments within a few days, with no need for further medication.",Acute gastritis medications,"Patients may use over-the-counter antacids (TUMS, milk of magnesia and Pepto-Bismol) to neutralize acid and reduce pain. Side effects can include constipation and diarrhea.","Prescription medications that can treat acute gastritis include histamine (H2) blockers, such as famotidine [Pepcid] and cimetidine [Tagamet], as well as proton pump inhibitors like omeprazole (Prilosec) and esomeprazole (Nexium).[11]","If H. pylori infection is a cause of the acute gastritis, antibiotics like amoxicillin, clarithromycin and tetracycline may be given in conjunction with these other medications. These are not appropriate for children under 12. If a person is affected by anemia or B12 deficiency, B12 shots can be a solution.",Prevention,"Though gastritis arises from several different causes, a few steps can help safeguard against it:","
Avoiding smoking or using nicotine products

,,,,,,,,,,What is acute HIV infection?,"Acute HIV infection, also known as an early or primary retroviral infection, is a condition that develops within two to four weeks of contracting human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).","Symptoms of acute HIV infection are similar to other viral infections, such as the flu or mononucleosis (mono or glandular fever). For this reason, many people do not realize they have been infected with HIV. A blood test is the best way to confirm an HIV infection.","There are two types of HIV: HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is the more common form of HIV found in the United States. The term HIV in this resource refers to HIV-1, unless otherwise stated.[1]","HIV attacks the body's immune cells. Without treatment, a person with HIV becomes more likely to develop infections or infection-related cancers. The last stage of HIV infection is AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), when the immune system is severely damaged.[2]","There is currently no effective cure for HIV infection but, with the right treatment and medical care, the outlook for people with HIV is good.",Symptoms of acute HIV infection,"Many people develop symptoms of acute HIV infection two to four weeks after contracting HIV. Symptoms can last for several weeks and are similar to other viral infections such as flu. Signs and symptoms can include the following, starting with the most common:[3][4][5][6]","
Mouth ulcers
Red rash
Aching muscles
Joint pains
Unintentional weight loss
Fever
Loss of coordination
Tiredness
Headache
Swollen lymph nodes
Sore throat
Diarrhea
","Some HIV-infected people do not have any symptoms, or may have symptoms that are mild and not particularly troublesome.","All these symptoms can also be caused by other illnesses. If a person has symptoms following potential exposure to HIV, they should be tested for HIV as soon as possible.[2] People concerned that they may be experiencing symptoms of acute HIV can also use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.",Causes and stages of acute HIV infection,"HIV is caused by a retrovirus which attacks the body’s immune system, specifically CD4 blood cells which are responsible for fighting infections. During acute HIV infection, the HIV retrovirus destroys a lot of CD4 cells as it replicates. This can cause some people to fall ill with flu-like symptoms.",Acute HIV infection is the first stage of HIV infection. It is followed by two further stages:[2],"Clinical latency, also known as asymptomatic HIV infection or chronic HIV infection. The HIV retrovirus continues to replicate within the body, but at low levels. The infected person may not experience any HIV-related symptoms, but can still transmit the virus to other people. Without treatment, this stage can last around 10 years. Towards the end of this phase, the person’s CD4 count starts to decrease and they may start to show symptoms.","AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) is the final stage of HIV infection. Without treatment, a person can expect to develop AIDS after approximately 10 years. During this stage, a person’s immune system is badly damaged and they are susceptible to severe illnesses such as chronic cryptosporidiosis, lymphoma and pneumonia. Without treatment, a person with AIDS will typically only live around three years.[7]","Treatment can slow the progression of HIV infection, often by decades.",Who is at risk of acute HIV infection?,"HIV can affect people of any age, sexual orientation or race, in any part of the world. However, certain groups of people are more at risk of contracting HIV than others. These can include people who:[8]","
Have unprotected sex, particularly anal sex, with multiple partners
Share needles when injecting substances
",HIV can be spread in the following ways:[8][9],"
Contact with infected blood
Contact with infected semen
Contact with infected vaginal and/or rectal fluids
From mother to child during pregnancy or birth if the pregnant woman has HIV
Less commonly, during breastfeeding if the breastfeeding woman has HIV and is not on antiretroviral treatment[10]
Sharing needles, syringes or drug preparation equipment with someone who has HIV
","Other physical contact, such as hand-holding, kissing or hugging, does not transfer HIV..",Risks of transmission during acute HIV infection,"During the acute HIV infection phase, there are very high levels of HIV in the body. This means the risk of transmitting HIV to another person is high.[11]",Diagnosis of acute HIV infection,"The only way to confirm an acute HIV infection diagnosis is to be tested for HIV. There are different types of tests, depending on how long it has been since the person’s potential exposure to the HIV virus. Testing will involve either a sample of fluid swabbed from the mouth, or a blood sample.","Antibody tests are the most common tests for HIV, including rapid tests and home tests. Antibody tests screen for HIV-1 antibodies, which are produced by the immune system after exposure to the HIV virus. It takes at least three weeks, and sometimes up to 12 weeks, for a person to develop enough antibodies to be detectable in this type of test.[12]","Combination, or fourth-generation, tests detect both HIV-1 antibodies and p24 antigens. The p24 antigen is part of the HIV virus and can be detected as early as two weeks after infection in some people, although for others it can take up to six weeks. The amount of p24 antigen in the blood is gradually reduced by antibodies, which makes it unsuitable for use in diagnosing HIV after the very early stages.[12][13]","Nucleic acid tests detect the HIV virus itself in the blood. The test is expensive and usually only used in cases where high-risk exposure has occurred, or the person has symptoms of acute HIV infection. Nucleic acid tests can detect the HIV virus as early as one week after infection in some people, but it may take up to four weeks until detection is possible for others.[12]",HIV test window period,"The window period is the amount of time between when a person is first infected and when a test is able to accurately diagnose HIV infection:[14] The following numbers are a guide, as the exact numbers may vary between tests and labs.","
Antibody tests: 21 to 84 days after infection
Fourth generation tests: 13 to 42 days after infection
Nucleic acid tests: seven to 28 days after infection
","The first number for each test is the earliest possible time that an HIV infection can be detected with that test. However, each person responds differently to infection, so, in some cases, HIV may not be detectable until much later (indicated by the second number). If an early HIV test produces a negative result, it is advisable to have another test after the end of the window period.",Treatment of acute HIV infection,"Acute HIV infection is treated with antiretroviral drugs (ARVs), which are drugs specially designed to treat retroviruses. People with HIV are prescribed a combination of antiretroviral drugs, which together are known as antiretroviral therapy (ART).","Antiretroviral therapy reduces the amount of virus (viral load) in the body. It does not cure HIV infection, but, taken correctly, it can slow progression of the condition from one stage to the next. For example, one recent study showed that a person diagnosed at age 20 who has appropriate treatment now has a life expectancy very close to that of a person without HIV.[15]","Antiretroviral therapy should be started as soon as possible after diagnosis. It is very important to take antiretroviral medication correctly. Missing doses or stopping and restarting treatment can lead to drug resistance, which can reduce future treatment options.[16]","Side-effects of ART may lead some people to consider stopping their medication. However, the long-term benefits of ART exceed the difficulties posed by some side-effects. It is very important not to stop taking ART without speaking with a doctor, who may be able to prescribe a more comfortable combination of antiretroviral drugs. More recent developments in ART mean that intolerable side-effects are fewer than in the past.[17]",Side-effects associated with taking antiretroviral drugs include:[16][18],"
Nausea
Vomiting
Tiredness
Headache
Insomnia
Dry mouth
Diarrhea
Fever
Dizziness
Rash

","Doctors can generally tailor ART for a particular person to counter potential adverse effects, and a person may take various different antiretroviral drugs over the course of a lifetime.[17]",More serious side-effects can emerge after taking antiretroviral drugs for a long time. These include:[18][17],"
Chronic renal failure
Diabetes
Osteoporosis
Liver damage
Heart disease
Hyperlipidemia, an excess of fats in the blood
Lipodystrophy, metabolic changes in how the body uses and stores fat
Depression
","People who have contracted HIV become more susceptible to other medical conditions, so they will benefit from lifestyle changes such as eating a healthy and balanced diet, practicing safe sex and reducing stress levels. HIV infection often has a large emotional and psychological impact, so counseling and social support should be available throughout treatment.",Post-exposure Prophylaxis (PEP),"PEP is a combination of antiretroviral drugs intended for use in emergency situations. When taken correctly, PEP can help to prevent HIV infection, but it is not 100 percent effective. Post-exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) must be started as soon as possible after, and within 72 hours of, potential exposure to HIV infection.[19]","PEP must be taken exactly as directed for 28 days.

MRI or computerised tomography (CT) scans can show damage to heart muscle
Nuclear ventriculography, which uses radioactive materials injected into the bloodstream to form an image of the heart moving
","Types of heart failure which may occur in combination can be diagnosed by scanning, and testing the capabilities of the heart include:[5][23]","
Systolic failure: Also known as heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), this is when the left ventricle stops contracting normally and cannot circulate blood around the body properly.
Diastolic failure: Also known as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), this is when the left ventricle stops relaxing properly and so cannot fill with enough blood during a heartbeat.
",Treatment of acute heart failure,"Acute heart failure can be life-threatening and anyone with symptoms should see a doctor as soon as possible. Treatment is initially focused on alleviating life-threatening symptoms, then on the investigation of underlying causes and treatment of residual symptoms. Hospitalization is generally required while cardiac performance improves.[4]",There are a range of potential treatments for acute heart failure. The treatment that is applied will depend on the person’s symptoms and the underlying issue causing them. For example:,"
Shortness of breath (dyspnea): This symptom is treated with supplemental oxygen. The severity of dyspnea will dictate whether oxygen is supplied through a tube in the nose or a face mask. Sitting upright can help with breathing.[4][24]
Buildup of fluid: Intravenous diuretics are used to treat buildup of fluid within the body. A pulmonary edema will also be treated with diuretics, as well as oxygen and heart failure medication.[9][25]
",Ongoing management of acute heart failure,"Most patients with acute heart failure have worsening symptoms of chronic heart failure. As soon as the acute episode is stabilized, there are various types of medication which can be prescribed. Most of them are vasodilators, which widen the blood vessels to help lower blood pressure:[5][26][27][28][29][30]","
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which lower blood pressure and reduce stress on the heart
Hydralazine, isosorbide and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), all of which work by relaxing blood vessels to lower blood pressure
Aldosterone antagonists, which reduce the body’s sodium levels to lower blood pressure
Beta blockers, which lower blood pressure and slow the heart rate
Digoxin, which makes the heart beat more strongly
Nitrates, which are usually given as a vasodilator when the person also has pulmonary edema
Painkillers, such as morphine, may be useful to reduce anxiety in people who are restless and distressed
","Once the initial symptoms of acute heart failure have been brought under control, the condition needs to be managed to avoid further episodes.

,,,,,,,,,,What is acute laryngitis?
,,,,,,,,,,What is acute laryngitis?,"Acute laryngitis is a short-term inflammatory condition affecting the larynx, or voice box, typically lasting less than 3 weeks.[1] Laryngitis which lasts longer than three weeks is called chronic laryngitis; see this resource for more information.","Laryngitis can affect people of every age and gender. The main symptoms of laryngitis are a hoarse voice, also known as dysphonia, and sore throat, due to inflammation in the laryngeal area.","Acute laryngitis may have infectious or non-infectious causes, including overuse of the voice which puts a strain on the vocal cords, or gastrointestinal reflux disease (GERD); laryngitis caused by GERD is called reflux laryngitis.","Treatment for laryngitis may include resting the voice, simple pain relief, and home remedies such as drinking warm liquids to soothe the throat. If laryngeal discomfort and other symptoms are still present after three weeks, antibiotics may be prescribed, if the cause is diagnosed to be a bacterial infection. An antifungal medication may be prescribed if the cause is a fungal infection.","Most people recover from acute laryngitis within three weeks, and do not go on to develop chronic laryngitis.",Symptoms,Typical symptoms of laryngitis include:,"
Dysphonia (hoarseness of the voice)
Fever (during the first few days of infection)
Sore throat
A need to clear the throat frequently
A cough
","Symptoms usually appear suddenly and worsen after around three days.[1] After around three weeks, with appropriate treatment including drinking plenty of water and resting the larynx, symptoms such as a cough and hoarse voice usually relieve.","Even though acute laryngitis usually relives without the need for medical attention, it is important for an affected person to see a doctor promptly if they:","
Experience swallowing problems (dysphagia)
Cough up blood
Have trouble breathing
Have a persistent fever, with a temperature of higher than 103 F (39.4 C)
Have respiratory problems (breathing difficulties)
","These symptoms may indicate epiglottis, a condition in which the tissue that covers the lid of the windpipe becomes inflamed. Epiglottis can be life-threatening for both children and adults.[2]","In children, the symptoms of laryngitis are the same as those in adults. When children under five are affected, the condition is called croup. Croup usually clears up in 5-7 days, and medical attention should be sought if their symptoms of infection do not improve during this timeframe. Antibiotics are not used to treat croup, because it is caused by a viral infection.[3]",People experiencing possible symptoms of acute laryngitis can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.,Causes,"There are both infectious and non-infectious causes of acute laryngitis. The most common causes are a flu or cold due to a virus. Non-infectious causes include overuse of the voice, gastric reflux (which can irritate the lining of the throat), or an injury to the voice box region.","The hoarseness of the voice (dysphonia) which results from laryngitis is caused by the distorted shape of the inflamed larynx. Because the vocal cords in the larynx are swollen, the air passing over them makes sounds (speech) which are different from normal.",Risks,"While hoarseness of voice persists, it is advisable to avoid overusing one’s voice (shouting or speaking for prolonged periods), because this can result in permanent damage to the vocal cords.","It is important to treat the condition before it becomes chronic (long-lasting), because having an inflamed larynx for a prolonged period of time can result in the development of tears and/or growths in the laryngeal tissue, as well as vocal cord strain. See this resource on chronic laryngitis for more information.",Diagnosis,"The diagnosis is usually made by examination of the throat. Doctors will focus on diagnosing the cause of the laryngitis, because this will determine the appropriate treatment, if any is needed. If laryngitis is due to a known underlying condition such as gastrointestinal reflux disease (GERD), the treatment and management plan for this may be adjusted, to prevent further laryngeal problems.","Doctors may perform a laryngoscopy to examine the larynx, to help them determine the cause of laryngitis.[4] This may be done indirectly or directly. An indirect laryngoscopy involves the doctor shining a light into the throat to examine the larynx, using a handheld mirror. A direct laryngoscopy involves the doctor inserting a small tube with a camera attached to it into the throat through the mouth to examine the larynx in detail.",Treatment,"Treatment depends on the source of the problem, but mainly involves resting the larynx, by not overusing the voice while hoarseness is present,.Drinking warm liquids and using medicated throat lozenges may be useful to soothe the throat.","Home remedies such as adding ginger or tumeric to warm drinks can help fight causal infections. Simple pain medications (ibuprofen or paracetamol) can help with the pain. If the condition is caused by bacteria, the treatment may involve antibiotics.",Prevention,"Prevention can be achieved by moderate use of the voice, and taking care to avoid catching or spreading viruses. Giving up smoking may also help to avoid laryngitis.",Other names for acute laryngitis,"

",Acute laryngitis FAQs,"Q: Is acute laryngitis contagious?
A: Yes. However, the degree to which it is contagious depends on whether the cause(s) of laryngitis are bacterial/fungal, viral, or whether it is due to an underlying condition. Most cases of laryngitis result from viruses, which themselves are not particularly contagious. Research suggests that the most likely time frame for viruses that cause laryngitis to be passed on to others is the period when the infected person has a fever. A person who is only affected by a hoarse voice, sore throat and cough is less likely to be contagious. Instances of bacterial and fungal causes of laryngitis are less common, but these kinds of infections are more contagious than viruses and therefore more likely to result in transmission. Washing hands regularly, particularly after coughing, and avoiding sharing food or utensils, are important preventative measures for avoiding the transmission of laryngitis.","Q: What happens when laryngitis becomes chronic?
A: Chronic laryngitis is less likely to be caused by bacterial or viral infections than acute laryngitis, and more likely to be caused by an ongoing problem or condition, such as by acid reflux from gastrointestinal reflux disease (GERD), habitual overuse of the voice which damages the vocal cords, excessive alcohol use, use of tobacco products (especially smoking), or chronic sinusitis. The symptoms of acute (short-lasting) laryngitis are the same as those of chronic (long-lasting) laryngitis, including a sore throat, hoarseness of the voice and having a cough. It is important to seek treatment if symptoms persist, because vocal cord strain and growths on the vocal cords can develop as a result of continual inflammation of the larynx."

Typical signs of acute otitis media are strong pain in the ear and difficulty hearing. Treatment is pain relief and sometimes requires antibiotics. Most people do not develop any complications and recover well from middle ear infections.",Risks,"Acute otitis media is caused by viruses (colds, the flu, ect.) or bacteria. This is why a middle ear infection might begin following an episode of a cold or the flu. People who smoke may be more likely to suffer from middle ear infections. Other conditions that cause swelling in the nose (such as allergies or swelling of the tonsils) may also make middle ear infections more likely, because this swelling blocks off a tube that runs between the nose and middle ear. Blockage of this tube can make it easier for viruses or bacteria to infect the middle ear.",Symptoms,"Typical symptoms of a middle ear infection are pain in the ear and difficulty hearing with the affected ear. There may also be headaches and fever. Severe cases may cause a burst eardrum and pus may run from the ear, though this is much more common when children are affected, and is uncommon in adults.",Diagnosis,The diagnosis is usually made by a doctor based on the symptoms and physical examination. An otoscope may be used - a small tool used to look at the eardrum.,Treatment,"The main treatment of middle ear infections is pain relief. Warm compresses or pain medication (such as ibuprofen and paracetamol) are both helpful for managing ear pain. Antibiotics are often not needed to treat middle ear infections, but may be offered to people with complicated ear infections or other medical issues.",Prevention,Taking care to prevent the spread of colds or the flu in the home and community can help prevent some cases of otitis media.

,,,,,,,,,,What is a panic attack?
,,,,,,,,,,What is a panic attack?,"A panic attack is an abrupt episode characterized by a sudden, intense feeling of fear or discomfort.","Panic is the most acute form of anxiety.[1] One’s body goes into fight or flight mode – becoming ready to escape from physical danger – but there is usually no actual source of danger present. Instead, the concurrent mental and physical symptoms of a panic attack occur in response to a buildup of anxious thoughts.","A person having a panic attack may feel that they are dying or losing their sanity during the attack. Although this is an inherently distressing experience, panic attacks pose no serious actual health risks. The typical duration of a panic attack episode is between 5 and 20 minutes, after which both the mental and physical symptoms associated with the attack will abate. Practicing therapeutic techniques, in particular breathing exercises, can help an individual to feel better after a panic attack.[1]","Panic attacks can affect people of all ages and may occur during any activity and in any location. Many people will experience a panic attack or two during the course of their lifetime, without developing an ongoing problem. Often, a panic attack will be associated with undergoing a particularly stressful life event, such as bereavement, a job change or separating from a partner, but it is also common to be unable to identify a trigger.","If a person experiences recurrent panic attacks, this is called panic disorder, a condition which is usually treatable with psychotherapeutic methods and/or medication.",Symptoms,"People who experience a panic attack are not usually aware that the episode is going to occur until it begins, particularly if they have not experienced a panic attack before.",Symptoms before onset,"Physiological changes in the body – such as an increasing heart rate – have been found to occur up to an hour in advance of a panic attack, but the first perceptible signs generally only become apparent as the attack begins. These include symptoms of mental distress, such as the belief that one is dying, and concurrent physical symptoms, such as increased heart rate (palpitations), sweating and trembling.","There are typically no perceptible signs of the onset of a panic attack. However, research has been conducted to test the hypothesis that panic attacks occur spontaneously. Findings suggest that imperceptible changes in the body can begin before the actual panic attack starts.","Physiological changes, which may take place up to an hour in advance of a panic attack, include:[2]","
Irregular breathing patterns
Increased heart rate
","However, these physiological indicators are subtle, unlike the symptoms that are present during a panic attack itself. In general, these changes go unnoticed by the affected individual and those around them and do not serve as an advance indicator of the panic attack that they precede.",Symptoms during a panic attack,"According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), four or more of the following physical and psychological symptoms must be present:[3]","
Palpitations, pounding heart or accelerated heart rate
Sweating
Trembling or shaking
Sensations of shortness of breath or smothering

Although this may be related to the distressing thoughts that accompany a panic attack, emergency medical services should be called if a heart attack is suspected, as – unlike a panic attack – a heart attack requires prompt medical attention and can be life-threatening.",Key differences between a heart attack and a panic attack include:[5],"
The location of the tingling sensation. In a heart attack, a person may experience a tingling sensation in their left arm, whereas in a panic attack the tingling sensation, if present, will affect the entire body.
The extent to which breathing speeds up. A panic attack often causes hyperventilation (breathing too quickly) but a heart attack does not. However, both panic and heart attacks can cause the sensation of shortness of breath.
The likelihood of vomiting. It is common to vomit during a heart attack, but less common to do so during a panic attack.
Pain in a panic attack will feel like a sharp sensation, and will feel worse when one breathes deeply or puts pressure on the chest. It will usually be felt all over the heart. It will disappear within five to ten minutes.
Pain in a heart attack will feel like a crushing feeling all over the chest and may extend into the shoulders, left arm, neck and back. It will last longer than ten minutes and will not be made worse by breathing or pressing on the chest.
","Despite being able to identify these differences, it is advisable to always seek medical attention if the affected person:[6]","
Has a history of heart attacks
Meets the risk criteria for a heart attack, such as high blood pressure, being overweight, getting limited physical exercise
Has never had a panic attack before
","If one is not deemed to be at risk of a heart attack, psychotherapeutic techniques such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) may be recommended in order to help the affected person overcome any long-term anxiety about having a heart attack. This will help prevent a fear of having a heart attack from manifesting in, or forming the basis of, future panic attacks.",Causes of panic attacks,"Anxiety disorder (AD) is the principal cause of all panic attacks. According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), approximately 40 million adults in the U.S. between the ages of 18 and 51 are diagnosed as being affected by anxiety disorders. However, the total number of people who are affected by anxiety disorders – and who are therefore predisposed to experience a panic attack – is thought to be far greater.[7]","Panic is the most acute form of anxiety. As such, a panic attack is caused by heightened anxiety, whereby the body undergoes physiological changes due to one’s thoughts, entering into a state called fight or flight mode. A person may not be consciously aware of the thoughts that induce this state, as it can be caused by the brain’s background activity.","Fight or flight mode is an automatic response to danger, rapidly preparing the body for physical activity, such as running away from or fighting off a predator. In a panic attack, however, there is usually no immediate physical threat to escape from.[8]","Physiological changes associated with fight or flight mode, that may contribute to a panic attack, include:","
Increased metabolic rate
Increased heart rate
Release of metabolic energy resources such as glycogen
Inhibited action of the digestive system
Constriction of blood vessels
Loss of hearing and dilation of pupils
Relaxation of the bladder and sphincters
",Triggers,"Stress is a principal factor in experiencing a panic attack. A panic attack may relate to life events that are stressful for a given individual in the short term, such as giving a presentation or boarding an airplane. However, continuous stressors, such as having a job one dislikes or an emotionally unhealthy relationship, can also increase one’s predisposition to anxiety and can therefore be triggers for panic attacks.[9] In research, stress related to illness and interpersonal conflict has been cited as the most common known triggers of panic attacks by affected people.","It is also common to be unable to pinpoint the trigger(s) of one’s panic attack. People, who experience panic attacks, often describe their mental state as being calm prior to the unexpected attack, and panic attacks can also affect people who do not consider themselves to be under stress. This may be because the anxious thoughts which generate the panic attack are subconscious rather than conscious.",Panic attacks can occur in any situation or location. Panic attacks in public spaces ‒ such as shopping centers and public transportation ‒ are particularly common.[10],"In people with panic disorder, situations or locations, in which one has already experienced a panic attack, can often become triggers for future panic attacks, as they can develop negative associations due to the fear of experiencing a panic attack again.","Situations, in which panic attacks commonly occur include:[11]","
Being in a crowded place
Driving
Being on public transport
Boarding or being inside a plane
","People with panic disorder often experience a reduced quality of life, because they make lifestyle changes that are designed to avoid trigger situations, such as avoiding crowded places.",Risk factors for experiencing a panic attack,"Although anyone may be affected by a panic attack, a range of factors may increase the likelihood for certain individuals. People who have a disorder that leads to elevated levels of anxiety are more likely to experience a panic attack. This includes:","
Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). A form of chronic anxiety that is often unrelated to a particular cause.
Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). In the case of OCD, a person experiences recurrent unwanted thoughts and compulsive behaviors. This can lead to panic attacks in some people, although, according to DSM-5 criteria, OCD is no longer listed as anxiety disorder.
Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Although PTSD is a trauma and stressor-related disorder rather than an anxiety disorder, panic attacks may relate to anxiety from PTSD, that develops after first or second-hand exposure to a traumatic event.
Social phobia. In people with social phobia, everyday situations regularly cause debilitating levels of anxiety.
","Other mental health conditions, such as depression, can also cause the anxious kinds of thinking that may precipitate a panic attack.[12]","Other factors, which increase one’s likelihood of experiencing a panic attack, include:[3]","
Heredity. The exact link between people’s genetic makeup and their predisposition to panic attacks is not yet fully understood, but people with panic disorder often have family members – particularly siblings – who are also affected.[13]
Intelligence. Having a high intelligence quotient (IQ) is associated with introspection. Spending lots of time alone, thinking, can lead to the development of the anxious thought cycles that precipitate panic attacks.
Temperament. Being prone to experiencing negative emotions (negative affectivity), and being prone to believing that one’s anxiety symptoms are harmful (anxiety sensitivity), are both contributing factors to the likelihood of experiencing a panic attack.[14]
Environment. Many people experience a panic attack as a result of stressors in their immediate environment, such as a currently stressful life experience. However, previous stressors can increase the likelihood of experiencing a panic attack in later life, and childhood trauma and abuse are common among those who are affected by panic attacks or panic disorder in adulthood.
Consuming certain chemicals. Smoking tobacco, drinking alcohol excessively, illicit substance misuse and adverse reactions to prescription medication are also linked to an increased likelihood of experiencing a panic attack.
Health problems. it is not uncommon for people experiencing ongoing ill health to develop anxiety related to their condition and prognosis. This can happen whether or not one’s health problem(s) is/are biologically conducive to anxiety or not, in the sense that they involve physical changes conducive to developing anxiety or fight or flight mode.
Biological causes. Certain conditions affect factors, like one’s hormone levels, breathing and heart rate, increasing the chances of one’s body unnecessarily entering fight or flight mode, which can cause a panic attack.
",Conditions which increase the likelihood of experiencing a panic attack include:,"
Hyperthyroidism, i.e. excessive production of the thyroid hormone
Hypoglycemia ‒ low blood sugar
Wilson’s disease, an excessive deposition of copper in the brain, liver and other tissues
Labyrinthitis, an inflammation in the nerves of the inner ear
Mitral valve prolapse, when the mitral valve in the heart does not close as tightly as in healthy people
Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, an abnormal increase in heart rate after sitting up or standing
Pheochromocytoma, a rare tumor of the adrenal gland tissue
",When to seek medical attention,"The first time one experiences a panic attack, one should seek medical attention promptly in order to check one’s overall physical and mental health and discuss the possibility and prevention of future panic attacks.","It is not uncommon for an individual, who has experienced a panic attack, to feel embarrassment in telling their family or doctor. Many people are unaware of how common it is to experience a panic attack and/or that it could relate to panic disorder or another form of anxiety ‒ conditions, which are highly treatable with appropriate psychotherapy and/or medication.","Even if one is not diagnosed with a mental health condition, one’s doctor will be able to advise on management techniques in the event that a future panic attack occurs and will be able to perform check-ups to rule out other conditions or health concerns. For example, one may be screened to rule out the risk of a heart attack, particularly if one believed that one was experiencing a heart attack during the episode.",Panic attacks do not always have further health implications,"Experiencing a panic attack is inherently distressing for the individual involved, especially if they were previously unaware of being affected by any form of anxiety. The possibility of experiencing a future panic attack ‒ particularly if one encounters scenarios similar to the circumstances of the initial attack ‒ is a common concern, but feeling this way does not necessarily mean that one will experience future panic attacks.","Furthermore, it is possible to experience one or more panic attacks without being affected by a related condition, such as anxiety disorder or panic disorder. Many people, who do not normally have anxiety or depressive disorders, experience one or more panic attacks in relation to a specific stressor or over the course of a lifetime.",Diagnoses related to panic attack,"For some individuals, experiencing a panic attack may be an indication that they have an ongoing mental health condition.","According to the DSM-5 Manual, the principal conditions which may be diagnosed after experiencing a panic attack, include:[3]",Panic disorder,"Recurrent panic attacks that are not related to another condition will be diagnosed as panic disorder, which is treatable with psychotherapy and/or anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) medications.","To be diagnosed with panic disorder, an individual must have experienced frequent, full-symptom panic attacks, which are not caused by a concurrent health condition or chemically induced. The extent to which one’s panic attacks impact one’s daily life between episodes will also be considered ‒ most people with panic disorder present with debilitating anxiety about the possibility of future panic attacks.","People with panic disorder are likely to experience panic attacks in situations which replicate or resemble the circumstances of a previous panic attack, such as being in a crowd or before public speaking. This can have a negative impact on a person’s day-to-day routine, as many people choose to avoid situations which may provoke a panic attack, thereby experiencing a diminished quality of life.[1]",Panic disorder usually occurs concurrently with other anxiety disorders. It is fairly rare for panic disorder to occur on its own. Conditions which most commonly co-occur with panic disorder include:[3],"
Other anxiety disorders, in particular agoraphobia
Bipolar disorder
Mild alcohol-use disorder
Depression

A panic attack can therefore be an indicator that one is affected by generalized anxiety disorder or a specific type of AD. One may be diagnosed with panic disorder in addition to another type of anxiety disorder.,"Mental health conditions, which feature anxiety and may be diagnosed following a panic attack, include:","
Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). A form of chronic anxiety that is often unrelated to a particular cause.
Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). In the case of OCD, a person experiences recurrent unwanted thoughts and compulsive behaviors.
Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Anxiety, which develops after first or second-hand exposure to a traumatizing event.
Social phobia. In people with social phobia, everyday situations regularly cause debilitating levels of anxiety.
Anxiety disorder caused by another medical condition. See the list of conditions related to anxiety in the “Risk factors for experiencing a panic attack” section of this resource.

",Treatment,"If one’s doctor diagnoses a mental health condition, such as panic disorder or another form of anxiety disorder, as a result of one’s consultation about panic attack(s), then an appropriate treatment plan will be devised. This will usually involve psychotherapy and/or medication, tailored to the needs of the individual and to managing their diagnosed condition(s).",This section provides advice on how to manage a panic attack during the episode itself and on the prevention of future panic attacks.,Dealing with a panic attack,"Although a panic attack comes on suddenly, often with no prior indication that it is going to happen, its initial symptoms intensify, and it tends to reach its peak after around 10 minutes. One can begin deploying various coping strategies to reduce the severity of a panic attack as soon as one notices the first signs.","Techniques which are useful in navigating a panic attack focus on calming the mind and body. Used effectively, they can reduce the severity of a given panic attack or prevent its initial stages developing into a full-symptom panic attack. Many helpful techniques related to managing a panic attack or preventing future episodes are derived from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which focuses on making changes to a person’s usual thought processes and behavior in relation to particular concepts.",Strategies for managing an oncoming panic attack include:[15],Relaxing the muscles,"A panic attack causes one’s muscles to tense up, so performing muscle relaxing exercises,  focused on relaxing both specific muscle groups and one’s entire body, can help calm the body during a panic attack.",Stopping all activities,"It is important to give oneself the space and time to experience and recover from a panic attack. If at work or at a social occasion, walk away and, if possible, find a quiet area in which to experience the panic attack and employ coping strategies such as breathing techniques. Interruptions from others, however well-intentioned, can make it difficult to focus on restoring the body and mind to a calmer state.",Thinking positively,There are many CBT techniques designed to help with deconstructing anxious thoughts and restoring calm during and after a panic attack. Doctors or psychotherapists will be able to recommend techniques appropriate to each person's mental health status and the nature of their panic attack(s).,Breathing exercises,The sensation of shortness of breath is one of the most commonly experienced symptoms of a panic attack. This is primarily due to the fact that panic causes breathing to become irregular. Re-regulating one's breathing is one of the most important methods for restoring the body to its pre-panic state.,"Breathing techniques for panic attacks focus on encouraging a person to breathe deeply and to breathe from the stomach rather than the chest. Many people begin to breathe in a shallow manner during a panic attack. This can inspire the sensation of shortness of breath, which can intensify the panic attack. It is important to remember that the sensation of shortness of breath is not actually dangerous, although it may contribute to one’s perception that one is dying during the panic attack episode.","Many people find it helpful to breathe into a paper bag during a panic attack. Inhaling recycled air is believed to raise the carbon dioxide levels in the blood, which can help to end a panic attack.[16]",Prevention,Preventing future panic attacks involves identifying the causal stressors and adopting self-care habits which can reduce one’s propensity to anxious thought processes.,"It is important not to adapt one’s routine in a way which involves avoiding situations and circumstances related to one’s panic attacks. Not only will this become debilitating, but avoidance can result in developing additional anxiety disorders such as social phobia.[16]",Techniques for preventing panic attacks include:,"Daily breathing exercises. These encourage deep breathing and combat one’s tendency to adopt the irregular or shallow breathing patterns. Shallow breathing is a symptom of panic attacks. Additionally, usually practicing irregular or shallow breathing can contribute to a person being in an anxious mindset in general, which makes experiencing a panic attack more likely.","Adopting cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques. CBT techniques can change the thought processes which contribute to panic attacks. Daily use of CBT techniques can reduce one’s overall anxiety over time, helping to prevent panic attacks in the long term.","Regular exercise, especially aerobic exercise can release tension, improve one’s breathing and increase one’s self-esteem, which can reduce one’s predisposition to the  anxious thought cycles that induce panic attacks.",Dietary changes which can help prevent panic attacks include:,"

A: A panic attack is a specialized medical term which can be identified using the DSM-5 criteria, as quoted in this resource. In contrast, an anxiety attack is an increasingly medically-recognized concept, but it does not yet pertain to an established set of diagnostic criteria. In general, people who experience anxiety attacks describe periods in which they feel intense anxiety, but this does not necessarily involve the same level of acute distress as a panic attack or the delusional thinking, such as believing that one is dying, or entry into fight or flight mode.[17]If you think that you or a loved one may be affected by anxiety, panic disorder or another mental health condition, you can get a free symptom assessment by downloading the Ada app.","Q: Is it possible to have a panic attack in one’s sleep?

The condition generally causes pain and a sensation of scratchiness in the region of the throat, as well as difficulty swallowing.[1] The condition is typically referred to as a sore throat.","Pharyngitis is a very common complaint, usually caused by a viral infection, or, more rarely, a bacterial infection. In the majority of cases, it will disappear within a week, though can last longer. Treatment will usually focus on managing the symptoms. However, antibiotics may be prescribed to treat the bacterial form of the condition . Generally, it is a non-serious condition, though in some instances it can cause severe symptoms or a serious infection.",Chronic pharyngitis,"Pharyngitis is usually a temporary condition, lasting for roughly one week. In a small number of cases, however, a sore throat can be recurring, becoming a condition known as chronic pharyngitis. The chronic form of the condition has a variety of possible causes, including persistent infection and stomach acid reflux. If pharyngitis lasts for weeks, it is probably chronic rather than acute pharyngitis. Smoking, vaping and exposure to other forms of smoke, such as industrial or woodsmoke, can all cause a chronic sore throat.",Symptoms of acute pharyngitis,"A variety of symptoms are associated with pharyngitis, with some of the most common including:[2]","
Sore throat
Pain or difficulty when swallowing or talking
Swollen, sore glands in the neck or throat
Red throat and red, swollen tonsils
A hoarse voice
White or grey patches on the back of the throat
","A sore throat is the characteristic symptom of pharyngitis and – in some cases – may be the only symptom. A cobblestone appearance at the back of the throat, colloquially known as “cobblestone throat,” is in some cases present. This is a distinctive lumpy, irritated appearance of the back of the throat, caused by enlarged lymphatic tissue. It is visible on visual inspection. It can also be caused by a post-nasal drip, in which mucus that accumulates in the back of the nose and throat drips downward from the back of the nose.","Commonly, pharyngitis is caused by an underlying condition such as a common cold or flu.

While most episodes clear without causing lasting renal damage, it can be severe and is usually quite painful, although few patients will need to be hospitalised.[1]","This condition is most common among young adult women, but can affect anyone of any age.[2] Men are at relatively low risk of acute pyelonephritis, unless they are older than 65 years of age.[3]",Causes and risk factors,"Most cases of acute pyelonephritis occur when bacteria, that are present in the gastrointestinal tract, come into contact with the urethra, move into the bladder and travel upward from the bladder to the kidneys.[1] In rare cases, the condition can arise hematogenously, which means that the bacteria which cause it originate and travel in the blood.",Some of the bacteria most commonly implicated in such infections are:[2][3],"
Escherichia coli,more commonly referred to as e. coli
Pseudomonas aeruginosa
Staphylococcus saprophyticus
Group B streptococci
Enterococci
Other enterobacteriaceae
Klebsiella spp.
Corynbacterium urealyticum
Mycobacteria
","In rare cases, yeasts and fungi may also be implicated. However, e. coli is by far the most common bacteria causing acute pyelonephritis. Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), the backward flow of urine from the bladder to the kidneys, may also lead to acute pyelonephritis, as the refluxing urine can possibly carry bacteria.[3]","Although pyelonephritis can occur among any group of people, young women are most at risk, particularly between the ages of 15 and 29. This may have to do with the role of frequent sexual intercourse in introducing bacteria to the exterior opening of the urethra and from there to the bladder. The use of spermicidal contraceptives can increase the risk of pyelonephritis, as well as cystitis and other urinary tract infections, because they destroy the natural protective barrier of bacteria that should be in the vaginal area and allow enteric bacteria to colonise the area instead.[2]  New sexual partners can also increase one’s risk of a urinary tract infection (UTI), with more frequent sexual intercourse increasing the risk of potentially introducing new bacteria. There is some medical evidence that women with diabetes may be at slightly higher risk of contracting UTIs and consequently acute pyelonephritis.[4]","Urinary tract infections (UTIs) also increase an individual’s susceptibility to acute pyelonephritis. Many of the bacteria associated with pyelonephritis are the same as those which can cause cystitis. In addition, women whose mothers have a history of UTIs may be more vulnerable to acute pyelonephritis.",Other factors that increase an individual’s risk of developing acute pyelonephritis include:[2][3],"
Diabetes mellitus
Stress urinary incontinence
A structurally or functionally abnormal genitourinary tract, such as might result from infected cysts, underdeveloped kidneys, spinal cord injuries, or VUR.
Catheterisation
Stents or drainage procedures in or around the kidneys

",Diagnosing acute pyelonephritis,"Apart from noting the symptoms mentioned above, doctors examining a patient with suspected acute pyelonephritis will obtain a urine sample from them, and perform a basic test for abnormal color and odor. Additionally, they may perform tests such as:[2][5]","
Dipstick analysis, which may be positive for blood, nitrite or leukocyte esterase. The latter is an enzyme produced by white blood cells.
Urinalysis (analysis of the urine) to check for white blood cell casts and microscopic pyuria, i.e. pus in the urine.
A bacterial culture of the urine to determine what kind of bacteria has caused the pyelonephritis. This may be particularly useful if the first line of antibiotic treatments does not clear up the infection, suggesting that the bacteria is drug-resistant or that another pathogen is responsible.
Blood tests, such as a complete blood count should be performed in more complicated cases, along with analysis of inflammation markers. Markers that can indicate declining kidney function, and measurement of electrolytes may be necessary, too.
Imaging tests such as an MRI, CT scan or ultrasound.
","Doctors will also take a history from the patient to determine whether any underlying disorders, such as a genitourinary abnormality or diabetes mellitus, are present and gather information about their lifestyle, for example, whether or not the patient is sexually active, experiences stress urinary incontinence, etc to find out what may have caused the infection to set in.",Treatment,"Most people affected by  acute pyelonephritis are successfully treated with  antibiotics and do not need to be hospitalised. However, in cases of very severe and/or complicated infections, hospitalisation may be safest in order to monitor the infection consistently and to control its spread most effectively. Hospitalisation can be avoided if treatment is sought early on in the course of the infection.",Outpatient treatment,"Bed rest, painkillers and hydration are the cornerstones of home treatment for acute pyelonephritis. Staying well hydrated helps to heal the kidneys and flush out the pathogens. However, over-hydration is counterproductive and should be avoided. Painkillers such as paracetamol (acetaminophen) and ibuprofen can be taken orally to manage pain.[6]","The most common form of treatment for acute pyelonephritis is antibiotics. In some cases, the infection may involve drug-resistant strains of bacteria or the wrong dosage or wrong drug is prescribed.[2] In such instances, antibiotics will not work and the risk of developing complications increases. However, antibiotics generally do work.",Some of the oral antibiotics most commonly prescribed are:[2][7][8],"
Fluoroquinolones (e.g. ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin), in areas where drug resistance is low
Ceftriaxone
Gentamicin
","Oral beta-lactam antibiotics, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole are generally not helpful. There is considerable resistance to fluoroquinolones among E. coli bacteria, and so treatment with such antibiotics may not be efficacious.[2][9]",Hospitalisation,"In cases of severe or complicated infection, hospitalisation is advised. Much like home treatment, inpatient treatment involves antibiotics, painkillers and monitoring for approximately five days and possibly longer, depending on local practice. In some cases, surgery may be required to deal with underlying conditions causing complications, such as enlarged prostate or kidney stones. Also, in severe cases, surgery may be necessary to drain pus away from the kidneys. Antibiotics may be delivered intravenously into a vein in the arm, via a drip, including:[2][7][8]","

If these signs appear, seek emergency medical help immediately.",Learn more about Sepsis >>,FAQs,"Q: Can I prevent acute pyelonephritis? 
A: Acute pyelonephritis cannot be entirely prevented, but the risk can be minimised. Remaining adequately hydrated flushes potentially harmful microorganisms and urine out of the bladder and urethra, reducing the risk of infection.","Avoiding spermicides and vaginal douches, as well as urinating after sex (for both men and women) also removes potentially dangerous bacteria from the area of the urethra and urethral opening. Urinating when the urge arises, rather than waiting to do so, and fully emptying the bladder lower the risk of kidney infections.[12]","In cases where infection arises, the period of recovery can be shortened by promptly seeking medical attention.","Q: Frequent sexual intercourse is listed as a cause of UTIs and a risk factor for acute pyelonephritis, but what is “frequent sexual intercourse?” and why is it so important? 
A:  What constitutes frequent sexual intercourse varies according to various factors, such as marital status and age. For example, married/partnered young women tend to have sex more often than single young women.[13]","Some studies have found that sex three or more times a week, or ten times in the last month, increases the risk of getting a UTI.[14] It does seem to be the case that frequent sex is the major risk factor for getting a UTI. About 80% of women with a UTI have had sex within the last day.[15]","The cause of this high risk appears to be that, during sex, new bacteria, usually from the enteric tract and anal area, are introduced to the vaginal and urethral area. New partners carry new combinations of bacteria and have different effects on skin pH, among other things. However, smoking and having previously had a UTI also increase risk. Anatomical differences between women, like the size of the pelvis and vaginal pH, may also affect risk.","Q: Does cystitis or urinary tract infection increase my risk of acute pyelonephritis? 
A: Cystitis is a very common urinary tract infection, specifically an inflammatory infection of the bladder. Many of the bacteria that cause acute pyelonephritis can cause cystitis. Many of the symptoms are similar to those of acute pyelonephritis.[16]","Both men and women can get cystitis. Recurrent, severe and/or untreated cystitis can increase the risk of acute pyelonephritis.","Q: I am male; how serious is my risk of acute pyelonephritis? 
A: Men are generally at lower risk than women; however, older men and male infants have the same level of risk as older women and female infants. Male infants with genitourinary abnormalities are at higher risk than female infants. However, due to the fact that the urethral opening and anus are further apart in men than in women, there is less likelihood of bacteria being transferred from one to the other. The risk is only lower, not absent.[16]","Men are advised to use condoms to reduce the risk of coming into contact with enteric bacteria that may enter the urethra, whether their partner is male or female. It may be advisable to avoid sexual activity while either partner has a UTI or kidney infection."

,,,,,,,,,,What is acute stress disorder (ASD)?,"A person who has experienced or witnessed a life-threatening, terrifying or otherwise deeply traumatic event may, in some cases, develop acute stress disorder (ASD), sometimes also called acute stress reaction. Examples of such events include:[1][2][3][4]","
Natural disasters, such as floods, fires or earthquakes
Physical or sexual assault
Car accidents
Sudden death of a loved one
Receiving a life-threatening diagnosis
","Symptoms of ASD may include flashbacks, nightmares or intrusive memories, avoidance of reminders of the event, difficulty remembering it, dissociation, an inability to experience positive emotions, anxiety, sleep disturbances, irritability, and difficulty concentrating. These symptoms can be very distressing. A person may also experience physical symptoms such as a pounding heart, nausea and difficulty breathing.[1][4]","Everyone processes traumatic experiences in their own way, and an event which does not trigger ASD in one person may trigger the condition in another. ASD seems to be more common in women than men. People who have a prior history of ASD, post-traumatic stress disorder or other psychiatric disorders, as well as people who have experienced a previous traumatic event, are also considered to be at increased risk of developing ASD.[4]","A diagnosis of ASD can be made three days to one month after the traumatic event. ASD is a short-term condition, and the outlook is generally good. Many people get better on their own, without any specific treatment. However, some people may benefit from timely diagnosis and treatment – which typically comprises psychotherapy, sometimes with medication – particularly where symptoms are severe or persist.[1][2]",Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),"If the symptoms of ASD persist for more than 30 days or first appear after this period,[5] a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may be considered. Treatment, which is usually psychotherapy, sometimes with medication, may be recommended to help lessen the symptoms and duration of PTSD. Most people recover from PTSD; without treatment, though, this may take several months or years. In a small number of people, the condition may become chronic.[6][7][8][9][10]","Not everyone who has ASD will go on to develop subsequent PTSD, and some people develop PTSD without experiencing ASD first.[11]",Symptoms,"Symptoms of acute stress disorder typically manifest immediately after a traumatic event. For a diagnosis of ASD to be made, they need to be present for between three and 30 days.[4]",People who are affected by ASD tend to experience extreme feelings of terror and helplessness in reaction to the trauma[3] and may develop psychological and physical symptoms.,The physical symptoms are typically caused by stress hormones such as adrenaline (epinephrine) and an overactivity of the nervous system. They may include:[1],"
Palpitations, i.e. a pounding heart
Difficulty breathing
Chest pain
Headache
Stomach pain
Nausea
Sweating
","These symptoms usually develop within minutes or hours of the traumatic event and may clear within a few hours or days. However, in some cases the symptoms persist for weeks.",Psychological symptoms of acute stress disorder include:[4],"
Arousal: Hypervigilance, an inability to focus, sleep disturbances, irritable mood and angry outbursts
Avoidance: Determination to avoid memories, people, feelings or places associated with the trauma
Dissociation: A sense of physical displacement, e.g. seeing oneself from outside one’s body, feeling dazed, experiencing an altered perception of time, difficulty remembering the event
Intrusion: Recurrent, involuntary flashbacks of the event, nightmares about the event
Negative mood: A generalized low mood, difficulty feeling and/or expressing positive emotions
",ASD versus PTSD,"Many of the symptoms of ASD are almost identical to those of PTSD. However, a diagnosis of PTSD will only be considered if the symptoms persist for more than 30 days or first appear more than one month after the trauma has occurred.","Though many people who are diagnosed with ASD do not go on to develop PTSD, it is thought that having the former may increase a person’s risk of developing the latter. A prompt diagnosis of ASD can help people manage the condition and reduce the risk of them developing PTSD.[11][3]",Causes,"Acute stress disorder can develop after a person, of any age, experiences or witnesses a deeply distressing or traumatic event – often one that is life-threatening or perceived as life-threatening. Examples include:[1][2][3][4]","
Natural disasters, such as floods, fires or earthquakes
Serious accidents
Physical or sexual assault, including domestic abuse
Combat
Terrorist attacks
Sudden death of a loved one
Receiving a life-threatening diagnosis
Facing a seemingly impossible challenge, e.g. related to one’s job or career
",Seeing a traumatic event on television or in other media is not typically considered a trigger for ASD.[4],Risk factors,Not everyone who experiences trauma will develop ASD. A number of factors may increase the risk of a person developing the condition. These include:[4],"
Being female
A history of trauma
A history of mental health conditions
The severity of the traumatic event
Neurotic personality traits, e.g. experiencing the world as largely threatening, distressing and unsafe[12]
Avoidance as a coping mechanism
",Diagnosis,"ASD can be diagnosed after symptoms have been experienced for at least three days. It is not possible to self-diagnose with ASD, as diagnosis requires an objective analysis of the symptoms of the affected person. If a person has experienced a traumatic event and thinks that they may have ASD, it is recommended that they visit a healthcare practitioner.
After taking the person’s history and performing a physical examination, a doctor will typically diagnose acute stress disorder using the following criteria.",DSM-5 diagnostic criteria,"To diagnose ASD, a doctor may refer to the DSM 5 diagnostic criteria, the official diagnostic criteria as listed by the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). These are:[4]","
Exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury or sexual violation: In addition to directly witnessing or experiencing a traumatic event, it is possible for a person to be affected by ASD if they learn that a traumatic event happened to a close relative or friend or are exposed to traumatic events as part of their job.
Presenting symptoms: Of the five categories of symptoms for ASD – intrusion, negative mood, dissociation, avoidance and arousal – someone who is affected by ASD will present at least 9 of the 14 symptoms, from any of the categories.
Duration of the disturbance: The symptoms of ASD must last for at least three days in order for a diagnosis of ASD to be made. They must also manifest between at most three days and one month after the traumatic event took place.
Significant distress: The symptoms are debilitating enough to impact the person’s usual way of life, such as through impaired performance at work or the inability to participate normally in social activities.
Ruling out other causes: To make a diagnosis of ASD, the doctor must establish that a particular event is the root cause of the condition. They will, therefore, take care to identify any other possible causes, ruling out physical conditions, such as brain injury, or other psychological conditions. They will also consider whether the condition could be attributed to the effects of substances such as medication or alcohol.
",Treatment,"Many people with ASD recover without any treatment. However, effective treatment options are available and may be recommended in cases where symptoms are severe or persistent.","Treatment, which is primarily psychotherapy, sometimes combined with short-term use of medication, is aimed at alleviating symptoms and reducing the risk of the person subsequently developing PTSD.[13]","If symptoms of ASD do not improve, a diagnosis of PTSD may be considered and the treatment plan revised accordingly.",Psychotherapy,"While there are many different types of psychotherapy, trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TFCBT) is the one recommended for the treatment of acute stress disorder. A timely course of TFCBT has been proven to reduce the likelihood of ASD developing into PTSD.[14][13]","TFCBT helps people to become aware of and adjust unhelpful thought patterns and behaviors related to the trauma, thus aiding the recovery process. It is usually initiated no sooner than two weeks after the traumatic event, with six weekly sessions of 60 to 90 minutes.[13]",Medication,"Medication is not a first-line treatment for ASD, and the World Health Organization generally advises against the use of sleeping pills, as well as anti-anxiety drugs in the form of benzodiazepines, in the management of the condition.[2]","If recommended at all, benzodiazepines such as clonazepam will typically be used only in low doses, for the short-term relief of severe anxiety and arousal symptoms. This type of medication carries risks of dependence if used long term and may also increase the risk of developing PTSD.[2][13]","Beta-blockers, a class of medication that is not addictive, may be prescribed to alleviate some of the physical symptoms of ASD.[2] Other medications, including anti-depressants, are currently not recommended for the treatment of ASD.[13]",Acute stress disorder FAQs,"Q: What are the symptoms of acute stress disorder in children?
A: If a child has experienced a traumatic event, it is important to monitor their behavior, as children are less likely than adults to recognize or self-report that they are experiencing symptoms of ASD. Difficulty sleeping, nightmares, repeated reenactment of the traumatic event through play, problems with concentration, detachment and irritability are all possible signs that a child is affected by ASD. If a caregiver suspects that a child may be experiencing ASD, it is recommended that they consult a health practitioner.[15]","Q: How is acute stress disorder different to post-traumatic stress disorder?
A: Many of the symptoms of ASD are very similar to those of PTSD, a typically longer-term condition that can develop after a person experiences or witnesses a life-threatening, terrifying or otherwise deeply traumatic event. ASD is a short-term condition that can only be diagnosed between three days and one month after a traumatic event, and it is thought to have a somewhat broader range of triggers than PTSD. If symptoms of a stress reaction persist for more than 30 days or first appear more than one month after the trauma has occurred, a diagnosis of PTSD may be considered. While many people who are diagnosed with ASD do not go on to develop PTSD, it is thought that ASD may increase a person’s risk of developing PTSD.[7][11][3]","Q: How is acute stress disorder different to adjustment disorder?
A: People affected by adjustment disorder may present symptoms similar to those of people affected by ASD. However, a major difference between ASD and adjustment disorder is related to the trigger of the condition. Whereas ASD is caused by a person experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event such as a car crash, natural disaster or sexual assault, adjustment disorder is triggered by a more broadly stressful, life-changing event or circumstance, such as the birth of a child, job loss, diagnosis with serious illness, marriage or the breakdown of a relationship. In addition, the reaction of the body’s nervous system tends to be less severe than in ASD. People affected by adjustment disorder typically recover within six months of no longer being exposed to the stressor.[16][17][18]",Other names for acute stress disorder,"

A: Although adjustment disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can have overlapping symptoms, the key difference between the two conditions is their cause. Adjustment disorder is typically triggered by a stressful event or phase, but one that is within the normal range of human experience, such as a marriage breakup or financial difficulty. Conversely, PTSD is triggered by an exceptional event, normally one involving the threat of death, serious injury or violence, that causes feelings of extreme fear, horror and helplessness. PTSD can also be a long-term condition that may not present itself for several months or years after the initial event. Adjustment disorder, on the other hand, must present itself within three months of the triggering event.[11]","Q: What is the difference between adjustment disorder and depression?
A: Adjustment disorder – especially the depressed mood subtype – and depression are similar conditions that can only be accurately differentiated by a doctor or other medical professional. It is generally thought that the major difference between the two conditions is that adjustment disorder is triggered by an identifiable stressful event or phase, whereas depression is more generalized, making it unclear what exactly is causing the condition. Adjustment disorder will also generally be a short-term condition.","Good to know: If a person who has been diagnosed with adjustment disorder continues to experience mental distress after six months, it is likely that the AD has developed into another mental health condition, most commonly depression. In this event, a new diagnosis will be considered. Other conditions developing from AD are usually anticipated to be longer-lasting and to require ongoing treatment. [12][13]"
,,,,,,,,,,What is alcohol intoxication?
,,,,,,,,,,What is alcohol intoxication?,"Alcohol intoxication, or drunkenness, is a temporary condition caused by drinking alcohol. Severe alcohol intoxication is also known as alcohol poisoning.","Although alcohol intoxication most commonly results from Ethanol contained in commercial alcoholic beverages, there are several other types of alcohol, found in a variety of sources, that can cause it. These include:[1]","
Methanol, which smells similar to ethanol, but is used in industrial applications
Isopropanol, also known as isopropyl alcohol, which is used in disinfectants and antiseptics
Ethylene glycol, which is used in antifreeze
","Good to know: Methanol is extremely toxic. If consumed, ten milliliters of methanol can cause blindness, and consuming thirty milliliters is potentially fatal.[1]","In adults, alcohol intoxication usually results from consuming alcoholic beverages. However, adults and children alike may also, accidentally or deliberately, consume the following household substances that contain alcohol:[2]","
Colognes and perfumes
Mouthwash
Aftershave
Solvents
Chafing-dish and portable camp-stove fuels
Medications, such as cough syrup
","Alcohol consumed orally is absorbed into the blood via the small intestine and the stomach, and because the body can absorb alcohol faster than it can metabolise or eliminate it, blood alcohol concentrations (BAC) peak between half an hour and ninety minutes after consumption.[3]","Alcohol is consumed primarily because some effects of mild alcohol intoxication, such as an increased sense of well-being and increased social confidence, are considered pleasant. However, negative effects, such as a fast heartbeat and nausea, can be felt as a result of having even low blood alcohol levels.","With increasing levels of blood alcohol, symptoms like dizziness, nausea, vomiting, changes in speech or a loss of control over body movements can occur. Acute alcohol intoxication is the most common alcohol-related disorder for which people are admitted to hospital.[2]","In severe cases, alcohol intoxication may lead to conditions that can temporarily impair the pancreas or liver. This impairment may become chronic if it recurs. However, alcohol intoxication is usually treated with fluids, and many people experience no lasting health consequences from alcohol intoxication itself, particularly if it is an isolated incident rather than a regular occurence. People who have mild to moderate alcohol intoxication usually recover well, although they may suffer symptoms including headache, nausea and vomiting for 1 or 2 days. This is known as a hangover. Heavy alcohol intoxication might result in serious health effects and may lead to complications and even death.",Risks of alcohol intoxication,Alcohol intoxication is caused by an excessive intake of alcohol; it is a very common condition.,"Alcohol is a central nervous system depressant.[3] The absorption rate of alcohol and associated risk of alcohol intoxication depends not only on the quantity of alcohol, but also on the context in which it was drunk. The severity of alcohol intoxication depends on:[2]","
How much alcohol was ingested
The percentage of alcohol in the beverage ingested
The period of time over which the alcohol was ingested
How used the affected person is to drinking alcohol and how tolerant of alcohol they are
The affected person’s body weight
The affected person’s biological sex
The affected person’s metabolism
Other health problems that the affected person may have
Medication that the affected person might be taking
Interaction with recreational drugs the affected person might have used
","Good to know: Some medications can increase the effect of alcohol, or affect the way it is metabolised.","People who do not drink alcohol often tend to get drunk more quickly and more severely than people who drink alcohol more regularly, though this is not always the case. Women and younger adults may become intoxicated more easily than men, due to the difference in body size and the ability to process alcohol.","Drinking on an empty stomach, drinking quickly, or drinking beverages that are stronger than one is used to all increase the risk of becoming intoxicated. Binge drinking is a major cause of alcohol intoxication, and is defined as:[4]","
In men: drinking five or more units of alcohol in two hours
in women: drinking four or more units of alcohol in two hours.

","Good to know: Moderate or serious alcohol intoxication can cause the affected person to lose alertness or become semi-conscious and can also cause vomiting. Therefore, it is important to monitor them to minimise the risk of aspiration, or inhalation, of vomit.[3] Aspirated vomit can cause death through suffocation, or can lead to bacterial infection of the lungs. To minimize the risk of vomit being aspirated, place the affected person in the recovery position, in which the person is placed on their side, facing slightly downwards, supported by bent limbs. A person in this condition must be monitored, and their caregivers should seek emergency medical help for them immediately.",Diagnosis of alcohol intoxication,"Good to know: If it is suspected that the person who has alcohol intoxication has consumed methanol, isopropanol or ethylene glycol rather than ethanol, an effort should be made to find out which one it was, as the treatment recommended in cases of  methanol or ethylene glycol intoxication is different to that which is carried out for ethanol (see FAQs).",The diagnosis is usually made by considering the symptoms of the affected person and a physical examination. Alcohol levels can be measured in the blood or in the breath with a breathalyzer machine.,"If doctors suspect that the affected person may be injured or have an underlying condition that is worsening the symptoms, other examinations may be carried out. Tests may be done, including X-rays or CT scans to check  for fractures from falls and/or blows to head. Fingerstick tests for blood glucose should also be done, as the symptoms of severe hypoglycemia resemble those of alcohol intoxication.[3]",Other disorders with symptoms that may be mistaken for alcohol intoxication include:[2],"
Intoxication from recreational drugs, such as cocaine or opiates, or prescription drugs such as benzodiazepine or barbiturates.

","Q: How is methanol intoxication treated? 
A: Methanol is extremely toxic, and if it is suspected that someone has ingested methanol, they must receive emergency medical care. In cases of methanol intoxication, immediate medical care is key if complications are to be avoided.","Methanol is metabolised by alcohol dehydrogenase, an enzyme, so treatment of methanol alcohol intoxication involves blocking the enzyme. This can be done with fomepizole: a high dose is given, followed by another in 12 hours. Ethanol has been used as an antidote for methanol, but this is not considered to be as safe or as effective as fomepizole treatment.[1] Folic acid will also be administered during recovery from methanol intoxication. In cases of methanol intoxication, hemodialysis is often used as it can rapidly remove methanol from the blood.","Q: Is ethylene glycol toxic? 
A: Ethylene glycol is toxic. Due to its sweet taste, there is particular risk of accidental  ingestion by children and animals. Ethylene glycol intoxication is treated in the same way as methanol intoxication.[1]",Other names for alcohol intoxication,"

Alcohol dependence, or alcoholism, is characterized by a strong and often uncontrollable desire to drink. People with alcohol dependence will typically build up a resistance to alcohol, meaning they need a subsequent increase in their alcohol intake to reach the state of being intoxicated.[1]","The symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, which can be both physical and psychological, will normally begin to present themselves around three to eight hours after an individual stops drinking. The first-line treatment for alcohol dependency is complete abstinence, which usually involves a programme to provide the affected person with psychological support throughout the withdrawal process. This usually involves group support sessions, in order to ensure that people do not feel alone as they go through the experience.","For people who are struggling with the physical symptoms of detoxing in particular, a course of medication designed to alleviate these might be prescribed.[2]",Symptoms,The symptoms of alcohol withdrawal can be divided into two types: physical and psychological.,Physical symptoms of alcohol withdrawal include:[3][4],"
Hand tremors (shaking)
Nausea
Thirstiness
Dry mouth
Abdominal pain
Headache
Increased sweating
Fever / increased body temperature
Excessive, purposeless physical activity
Hyperventilation (rapid breathing)
High blood pressure
Tachycardia (fast heart rate, with a pulse greater than 100 beats per minute)
Seizures, in severe cases
",Psychological symptoms of alcohol withdrawal include:,"
Depression
Anxiety
Irritability and mood swings
Sleep disturbances, including frequent awakening, restless sleep, insomnia and night terrors
Confusion
Transient tactile, visual or auditory hallucinations or illusions
Poor focus
Restlessness
","If an individual ceases to consume alcohol, most of these symptoms will decrease significantly after 10 days, but some might be present for longer.",People experiencing possible symptoms of alcohol withdrawal can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.,Alcohol withdrawal timeline,The stages of alcohol withdrawal can be roughly broken down into three stages:,"
Stage 1 (8 hours after last drink): Anxiety, insomnia, abdominal pain and nausea are typically experienced during the first stage.
Stage 2 (24-72 hours after last drink): High blood pressure, high body temperature, unusually increased heart rate, rapid breathing and confusion are typical of this stage.
Stage 3 (72+ hours after last drink): Hallucinations, fever, agitation and seizures are typical of this stage.
",This is a rough timeline – some individuals may experience a different timeline with differing symptoms.,Delirium tremens,Delirium tremens refers to a severe reaction to alcohol withdrawal. Symptoms will generally begin after around two to three days of ceasing drinking and may include:[5],"
Severe trembling and agitation
Heavy sweating
Increased heart rate
Nightmares
Global confusion
Disorientation
Visual and auditory hallucinations
Fever
High blood pressure
Convulsions, in rare cases
","These symptoms may appear suddenly, but they typically develop two to three days after the affected person stops drinking and are at their worst on the fourth or fifth day. Dehydration can also make delirium tremens worse. It is a serious condition which can in some cases be fatal. If any of these symptoms occur, immediate medical attention should be sought. In addition, the free Ada app can be used to carry out a symptom assessment.",There are several factors that make the development of delirium tremens more likely. These include:,"
A history of heavy drinking
A history of delirium tremens
Being over the age of 30
Having another illness
Developing alcohol withdrawal after two or more days
",Causes,The symptoms of alcohol withdrawal occur when a period of sustained and heavy alcohol consumption suddenly stops. Most people who experience alcohol withdrawal have an alcohol dependency.,"Alcohol affects the part of the brain responsible for the fight-or-flight response. Alcohol suppresses this response, making us relaxed. When withdrawing from alcohol use, the chemical balance of the brain is adjusted, meaning individual’s enter this fight-or-flight state, even without the presence of danger. It is this state that causes both the physical and psychological symptoms of alcohol withdrawal.[6]",Diagnosis,"A doctor will typically be able to diagnose alcohol withdrawal, after an individual answers a series of questions about their drinking habits and the symptoms which are being experienced, and once a physical examination has been performed.",Treatment,"Alcohol withdrawal requires both short-term and long-term treatment. The short-term treatment relates to managing a person’s physical and mental reactions to stopping drinking alcohol, and long-term treatment focuses on providing support to help a person maintain their abstinence.",Short-term treatment,"The first step in treating alcohol withdrawal will typically involve helping the affected person as they undergo a process of alcohol detoxification, commonly referred to as detox. This will usually be a supervised process, undertaken at a specialised treatment centre, in which individuals are helped to overcome the symptoms that may result from alcohol withdrawal. See the “Symptoms” section of this resource, above, for more information.","During the detox, people are recommended to:","
Drink plenty of fluids
Eat regularly
",Doctors will prescribe vitamin B1 (thiamine) in all cases of alcohol withdrawal. A deficiency of this vitamin affects around 80 percent of people who have experienced prolonged alcohol exposure.,"If a person is experiencing particularly strong symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, medications may be prescribed. The medications most commonly prescribed to help alleviate the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal are called benzodiazepines. These can help prevent minor alcohol withdrawal symptoms from becoming worse, e.g. in people for whom delirium tremens is considered to be a risk. Medications are not usually part of a typical first-line treatment plan for alcohol withdrawal, and these medications will be administered at the discretion of the medical professionals who monitor the detox process.","The second step in treating alcohol withdrawal involves psychological evaluation to identify the underlying causes of a person’s alcohol dependency. These causes may be psychological, physical, biochemical and/or social. Doctors will work with the affected person to identify these causes and to devise a long-term treatment plan tailored to their needs in order to help them remain abstinent from alcohol on a long-term basis.",Long-term treatment,"After the detox, people with a severe alcohol dependence will require the assistance of a qualified treatment centre, a rehabilitation centre, to help them recover from alcohol dependency. This period, which can last weeks or months, can be experienced as an inpatient or an outpatient, depending on the needs of the affected person. Most people with mild to moderate alcohol withdrawal symptoms will find treatment as an outpatient sufficient.[7]","To help people recover in the long-term, treatment centres will also provide advice on how to overcome alcohol dependency and on self-care and establishing living habits that promote their overall health and happiness. A person recovering from alcohol dependency may also be advised to attend support groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous to help them remain abstinent from alcohol.",Alcohol withdrawal prevention,"Alcohol withdrawal is caused by prolonged exposure to large amounts of alcohol and can therefore be prevented through limiting one’s exposure to alcohol, so as not to develop an alcohol dependency. Methods of doing this include:","
Quitting alcohol completely
Having frequent alcohol-free periods (days, weeks or months)
Not exceeding the recommended daily intake guidelines for alcohol. According to the US Department of Health, this is 1 drink per day for women and 2 drinks per day for men.
",Alcohol withdrawal FAQs,"Q: Is there a difference between alcohol withdrawal and a hangover?
A: Yes. Although the effects of a hangover are sometimes compared to mild alcohol withdrawal, there is a difference between the two. Alcohol withdrawal is a physical reaction to stopping drinking after prolonged and heavy consumption. People experiencing alcohol withdrawal will also typically be dependent on alcohol. A hangover, on the other hand, can be experienced by anyone, typically after a single bout of drinking alcohol. Alcohol withdrawal is a serious condition that can lead to acute and chronic complications, whereas a hangover is  non-serious in the majority of cases.[4][8]","Q: How long does alcohol withdrawal last?
A: The symptoms of alcohol withdrawal will typically begin to subside after 10 days in most cases. The timeline of alcohol withdrawal can be roughly split into three stages, with differing symptoms in each (see: the alcohol withdrawal timeline). The affected person should maintain their abstinence from alcohol for the rest of their lifetime, seeking help from available services whenever they feel the need to consume alcohol."

,,,,,,,,,,What is allergic conjunctivitis?,"Conjunctivitis is the name for  inflammation of the conjunctiva, which is the thin layer of tissue on the inside of the eyelids and which covers the white part of the eye. Also known as pink eye, conjunctivitis is often caused by bacteria (see bacterial conjunctivitis), a virus (see viral conjunctivitis), or allergens, for example seasonal pollen, dust or animal dander. When pink eye is caused by allergies, it is called allergic conjunctivitis. Like all types of pink eye, allergic conjunctivitis is common but not usually serious.[1][2][3]",Allergic conjunctivitis usually affects both eyes. The main symptoms include:[1][2][3],"
Pinkness or redness of the eye
Burning, intense itching or a sensation of grittiness in the eyes
Watering of the eyes
Swollen and/or reddened eyelids
Other symptoms of allergy, e.g. itchy nose, sneezing and scratchy throat
","Many cases of mild allergic conjunctivitis clear up on their own, without specific treatment, when contact with the causal allergen is minimized or avoided. Applying cool compresses to the eyes and using lubricating eye drops, also known as artificial tears, which are available over the counter, may help to relieve symptoms. However, allergy medications, such as antihistamine tablets and prescription eye drops, may be recommended, particularly for more severe cases of allergic conjunctivitis.[1][2][3]","Generally, people make a complete recovery and the condition does not cause any complications.

",Allergic conjunctivitis FAQs,"Q: Allergic conjunctivitis vs. pink eye – what is the difference?
A: Pink eye is the common term for all types of conjunctivitis. Allergic conjunctivitis is one type of pink eye and refers to pink eye that is caused by allergens. Other types of pink eye include viral conjunctivitis and bacterial conjunctivitis.","Q: Bacterial conjunctivitis vs. allergic conjunctivitis – what is the difference?
A: Bacterial conjunctivitis is pink eye that is caused by an infection of the eye(s) with bacteria. Allergic conjunctivitis is pink eye that is caused by allergens which lead to reactions in the eye(s). Some of the symptoms and treatments are different; antibiotic medications may be prescribed to treat bacterial conjunctivitis in severe cases of infection.","Q: Is allergic conjunctivitis contagious?
A: No, allergic conjunctivitis is not contagious.[2] Unlike viral conjunctivitis, which is caused by a virus, and bacterial conjunctivitis, which is caused by bacteria, allergic conjunctivitis cannot be spread to other people. It is the result of a specific person’s reaction to allergens which they are sensitive to, such as dust or seasonal pollen.","Q: Can you have allergic conjunctivitis in one eye?
A: Usually, allergic conjunctivitis is bilateral, meaning that it affects both eyes. It is possible that in a small number of cases, it may be unilateral, affecting only one eye. An example might be where an allergen comes into contact with just one of the eyes. However, most cases of unilateral conjunctivitis are caused by viruses or bacteria, or exposure to an irritant like a chemical substance, e.g. in a household cleaner spill that may affect the eye and are therefore not allergic in nature.[16][17]","Q: Can allergic conjunctivitis cause blurred vision?
A: Blurry vision can be a symptom of allergic conjunctivitis, as well as other types of conjunctivitis. However, any blurred vision associated with mild cases of conjunctivitis should clear when the person blinks or when discharge is wiped away from the eyes. If the blurriness is severe or persistent, it is important to see a doctor without delay, as a serious eye condition may be present.[4][18][19][20]","Q: Can allergic conjunctivitis cause discharge?
A: Yes. A clear, watery discharge is a common symptom of allergic conjunctivitis.","Q: What does allergic conjunctivitis look like?

Exposure to mold at home
","However, additional studies suggest that exposure to environmental or microbial biodiversity at a young age, such as living on a farm, may lessen the risk of developing allergic conditions.[13]",Allergic rhinitis diagnosis,Guidelines for diagnosis of allergic rhinitis are usually based on the symptoms reported by the affected person and their family history. Additional tests are sometimes required if the trigger for the allergic rhinitis is unknown. These tests involve giving the affected person small amounts of specific allergens to see if an allergic reaction takes place. This may include one or more of the following tests:[1][7],Intradermal test,"An intradermal test is normally the most accurate way to determine whether an individual is suffering from allergic rhinitis. Possible allergens, such as grass and weed pollen, are injected under the skin. After 20 minutes, the site is monitored for an allergic reaction, which usually involves reddening of the skin and an itching sensation.",Prick or scratch test,The prick or scratch test is the most common type of skin test. It involves pricking or scratching the skin before exposure to an allergen-containing solution. The results are known within 10 to 20 minutes.,Blood test,"This method is often chosen if a reaction to an allergen is likely to be too severe to do a skin test. A blood test looks for the level of Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody in the blood when exposed to different allergens. The more IgE there is when an allergen is introduced, the likelier it is that the affected person is allergic to that allergen. The results are generally less accurate than skin testing.",Allergic rhinitis treatment,"There is no cure for allergic rhinitis but its effects can be lessened by medication in the short-term, and, in some cases, sensitivity to the allergen can be reduced.",Antihistamines,"Histamine is one of the chemicals released in the body after an allergic reaction, provoking uncomfortable symptoms for the affected person. Antihistamines work to limit the release of histamine or lessen its effects once it has been released into the body. They most commonly come in tablet form, but can also be administered in the following:[14][15]","
Syrups and liquids
Eye drops
Nasal sprays
Ointments and creams

However, sedating antihistamines may be recommended if the condition is causing sleeping trouble.[15]","It usually takes an antihistamine tablet about 30 minutes to begin working, and it will be at its most effective between one and two hours after consumption.[14]",Nasal corticosteroids,"Nasal corticosteroids are sprays that reduce swelling and inflammation in the nose. They are also known as steroid nasal sprays. When suffering from seasonal rhinitis, it is often recommended start using the spray before symptoms are expected to begin showing.[16][17] If nasal corticosteroids are used daily, then nasal congestion, sneezing and other symptoms of allergic rhinitis are often significantly reduced[18].",Other medicines and treatment methods are sometimes recommended in combination with the more common treatments or as alternatives.

",Dust mites,"Dust mites are difficult to remove from a home, and it is often hard to detect when they are there. However, the following steps may help reduce the number of mites and the allergens they produce:[^24][24]","
Washing bedding regularly at high heat; at temperatures of over 130 degrees Fahrenheit or 60 degrees Celsius
Covering bedding in dust mite resistant covers
Keeping a home dry and well aired
Removing soft toys, sheepskin and woolen underlays from sleeping areas, or cleaning them regularly
Removing upholstered furniture, and use leather, plastic, vinyl and wood instead
Avoiding carpets, rugs and mats; wooden floors are preferable
Vacuuming thoroughly every week, and wearing a mask while doing so
Replacing heavy curtains with flat blinds that are easier to wipe down
Opting for synthetic bedding rather than feather
",Animal allergies,"Not having a pet that causes an allergic reaction is the best solution for managing this type of allergic rhinitis. However, if that is impossible, the following steps are advisable for owners of dogs and/or cats:[25][26]","
Do not have the pet in the bedroom, and try to confine it to specific areas of the house
Bathe the animal weekly
Keep the pet away from carpets
Regularly wash all bedding the animal comes into contact with
Use high-efficiency particulate air cleaners

Bathrooms
Basements
Refrigerators
Wardrobes
Closets
Humidifiers
Mattresses
On upholstery
In waste containers
Bedroom with an en-suite bathroom
","Dealing with mold problems means trying to make the house as dry and ventilated as possible. All visible mold should be removed as a first step, with bleach or specially designed cleaning products. Other steps to take include:[^24][27]","
Improving ventilation by opening doors and windows and installing extractor fans
Regularly cleaning affected rooms
Avoiding the use of humidifiers
Keeping carpets dry and removing wet ones
Fixing leaks in the house
Getting rid of pot plants from inside and avoiding garden waste
Unblocking gutters and vents
",Allergic rhinitis complications,There may be various complications that arise for those affected by allergic rhinitis. These can include:,Tiredness and distraction,"Allergic rhinitis can be very uncomfortable for the person affected. As a result of their symptoms, people with the condition can experience:[1][2]","
Tiredness, because of trouble sleeping
Problems remembering things
Irritability
Decreased concentration
",Adults with allergic rhinitis are estimated to be 20% less productive than usual when the symptoms are at their worst.[28],Middle ear infections,"A middle ear infection, otherwise known as otitis media, is a viral or bacterial infection of the usually air-filled cavity behind the eardrum. In most cases, a middle ear infection affects just one ear, but can also occur in both ears simultaneously.","Rhinitis can cause a blockage or swelling of the Eustachian tubes, that connect the throat and the middle ear. This results in a reduced ventilation of the cavity behind the eardrum and may lead to a build-up of fluid in the middle ear. [29] [30] A middle ear infection develops when bacteria or viruses that rise up, most often from the nasopharynx, grow in this fluid.[29]The infection can cause painful inflammation.",Read more about middle ear infections ».,Sinusitis,"Sinusitis, also referred to as sinus infection or rhinosinusitis, is an inflammation of the sinuses. The sinuses are air-filled cavities within the bones of the face and nose. Sinusitis occurs when these cavities become inflamed and blocked, leading to a number of uncomfortable symptoms.  One possible cause of the condition  is rhinitis or associated complications such as nasal polyps. Symptoms of sinusitis include:","
Nasal discharge
A blocked nose
Tenderness around the head
Sinus headaches
","Generally, sinusitis is a non-serious condition which can be managed through self-care methods and over-the-counter medication. In most cases, symptoms will disappear within two to three weeks.[7]",Read more about viral sinusitis ».,Nasal polyps,"Nasal polyps are soft swellings on the inside of the nose and sinuses. Rhinitis may act as a trigger for the development of polyps. They may have no effect, but sometimes they are so large or numerous that they cause blockages between the nose and sinuses. This can lead to the conditions conducive for sinusitis to develop. Corticosteroid sprays, which are often prescribed  for allergic rhinitis, can also be effective in treating nasal polyps.[7]",Transverse nasal crease,"Attempts to relieve the symptoms of allergic rhinitis by excessive rubbing or pushing the nose upwards with the hand can lead to damage of skin and cartilage. This has the potential to create a transverse nasal crease, a small groove in the skin of the affected person’s nose.[31]",Allergic rhinitis FAQs,"Q: Are there any home remedies for allergic rhinitis?
A: The mixture for a saline nasal spray to wash the irritants out of the affected person’s nose can be made out of salt, baking soda and boiled then cooled water. Steps can be taken at home to minimise exposure to specific allergens, such as closing windows to keep out pollen.","Q: What is the difference between allergic rhinitis and non-allergic rhinitis?
A: Allergic rhinitis is triggered by small particles known as allergens. Non-allergic rhinitis is caused by other factors, the most common of which is a cold."
,,,,,,,,,,What is amyotrophic lateral sclerosis?
,,,,,,,,,,What is amyotrophic lateral sclerosis?,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (also known as Lou Gehrig's disease or motor neuron disease) is a rare disorder in which certain nerve cells, located within the spinal cord and brain and which control muscle movement, are destroyed. The destruction of these nerves causes progressive muscle weakness and eventually leads to paralysis. The cause of ALS is not known. Early symptoms include tingling or weakness in arms or legs, muscle cramping and sometimes changes to the voice. There is no treatment to cure ALS, though there are some medications that will slow down the destruction of the nerve cells. Management of this condition aims to relieve the symptoms of ALS and support the person and their family. Most people with ALS will eventually die as a result of this condition, though there are famous examples of people living with ALS, such as the physicist Stephen Hawking.",Risks,"There are no known causes or risk factors for developing ALS. Genes may play a small role, as 5 percent of people with ALS have a family member with the condition. However, people with ALS will not necessarily pass the condition to their children. The condition usually appears between the ages of 50 and 70, and men are slightly more commonly affected than women.",Symptoms,"Early symptoms of ALS can be different from person to person, and include weakness and tingling in the arms and legs, muscle cramps and stiffness and sometimes voice changes or difficulty swallowing. People with ALS may find that they have difficulty controlling their emotions. As the condition progresses, the muscles become stiff and smaller, and people with ALS eventually lose their ability to move independently, to talk and to swallow and breathe.",Diagnosis,"Diagnosis is made by evaluating the symptoms, and undergoing a physical examination by a neurologist. There is no single diagnostic test for ALS. However, several tests may be used to rule out other possible causes of the symptoms. These include blood tests, scans (usually an MRI), nerve testing, investigating the fluid around the spinal cord (lumbar puncture) and, in rare cases, muscle biopsy.",Treatment,"There is no cure for ALS. There is a medication which can slow the progression of the disease, but the benefit of this can be different from person to person, and should be discussed with a neurologist. The management of ALS requires therapists from multiple areas to help maintain ability for as long as possible and to support a person physically, socially and emotionally. Eventually, breathing and eating can be replaced with feeding tubes or machines, but this is guided by individual beliefs and preferences.",Other names for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,"

,,,,,,,,,,What is anal cancer?
,,,,,,,,,,What is anal cancer?,"Anal cancer is a cancer that arises from the anus, the opening at the end of the rectum. The rectum is the final portion of the large intestine that stores stool until it leaves the body through the anus. This condition is uncommon, and tends to affect older adults. Early symptoms of anal cancer include bleeding or itching around the anus, a lump in or near the anus, and anal pain. Anal cancer spreads slowly and with early treatment, it has a relatively good prognosis.",Risks,"The causes of anal cancer are not well understood. It is strongly associated with infection with the wart virus, the human papillomavirus (HPV). Other risk factors include a weakened immune system, unsafe sexual activities, and smoking. Women who have been diagnosed with cervical, vulvar or vaginal cancer may be at higher risk of developing anal cancer. This condition is equally common in men and women, and is more common in older adults.",Symptoms,"Early symptoms of anal cancer include bleeding from around the anus, a lump in or near the anus, anal itching and discharge from the anus. Other symptoms may include anal pain, a change in bowel habits, and swollen lymph nodes in the groin and anal region.",Diagnosis,"Diagnosis is usually made by examining the area and undergoing a digital rectal exam, where a doctor gently feels the inside of the anus for any lumps. This test is often useful in detecting early cancer. Other tests that may be helpful are endoscopy (flexible camera) of the anus and rectum and ultrasound of the anal region. A small sample (a biopsy) of any growths will be taken and tested to see if cancer is present. If any of these tests are positive for cancer, further investigation is done to confirm the staging of the cancer.",Treatment,"The treatment of anal cancer depends on the size of the cancer, the exact type of cancer and whether the cancer has spread. The combination of these factors decides the stage of the cancer. Depending on the stage, anal cancer can be treated by radiotherapy, surgery and chemotherapy or a combination of therapies. The treating doctor can give the best advice as to treatment.",Prevention,"Practicing safe sex can help to prevent some cases of anal cancer. Quitting smoking may also be helpful. Vaccination against the human papillomavirus may prevent some cases of anal cancer, if a person has never had the virus before. Having routine digital rectal exams can help detect anal cancer before symptoms occur."
,,,,,,,,,,What is an anal fissure?
,,,,,,,,,,What is an anal fissure?,"An anal fissure is a very common condition where there is a painful tear in the lining of the anus, the opening where feces is excreted. It is often described as feeling like passing broken glass.[1]","Typical symptoms are a sensation of tearing, ripping or burning and usually a small amount of bright red bleeding during and after a bowel movement. While the condition can be very painful, it is not usually serious.","Some studies estimate that about one in 10 people may have an anal fissure in their lifetime, though it is not possible to establish a precise figure, because some people may be too embarrassed to discuss the condition with their healthcare provider, and it is often misattributed to hemorrhoids.[2]","Treatment consists in softening the stool, avoiding constipation and practicing good hygiene. Most anal fissures will heal within six weeks. An anal fissure that lasts for more than six weeks is called a chronic anal fissure. Occasionally, surgery is required to repair the tear.","Both males and females can be affected and, while anal fissures may occur at any age, they are primarily seen in young adults.[3]",Symptoms,The most common anal fissure symptoms may include:[4][5],"
A sharp, searing or burning pain in or around the bottom, which tends to be worse when passing feces and for about an hour or so afterwards
Some bleeding, usually bright red on the toilet paper or stool
Itching
","Good to know: A person with an anal fissure often puts off defecation, leading to a worsening cycle in which stools dry and harden, leading to further constipation and anal pain.[3]",Less common anal fissure symptoms may include:[6][7],"
Spasms or a tightening feeling in the anus when feces is excreted
A sentinel pile, a tag of skin which sometimes develops on the edge of the anus, below the fissure
Abscesses, a painful boil-like swelling near the anus filled with pus, which may lead to a fistula, a connection to the external skin, which may have a foul-smelling mucus discharge
",Anal fissure causes,"An anal fissure can occur when there is overstretching of the anal canal, which causes the lining to tear. Subsequent defecation stretches the area, meaning that healing is hindered. The anal sphincter may spasm as a result of anal fissure, restricting blood supply to the area and further hindering the healing process. In children especially, putting off defecation to avoid the associated pain may worsen constipation and exacerbate the problem.",Anal fissure may be classed as:,"
Acute anal fissure, which clears up within six weeks. This is the most common type, and normally appears as linear with clear edges.
Chronic anal fissure, which persists for more than six weeks. Chronic anal fissure healing time varies. Without treatment, it is possible to have an anal fissure for years.
","A chronic fissure is usually deeper than an acute anal fissure and is often associated with an external skin tag. Chronic fissure is usually treatable, but recurrence of the fissure after treatment is common.[1]",An anal fissure may also be classed as:[4],"
Primary: having no apparent cause
Secondary: due to an underlying condition, such as constipation, or resulting from pregnancy or childbirth
",Constipation,"Anal fissure most commonly occurs due to constipation. Lots of factors may cause constipation, but the most common include:[5][8]","
Not eating enough fiber
Not drinking enough fluids.
Some medications, particularly strong painkillers, such as opioids.
Not exercising or being less active
Frequently ignoring the urge to defecate
Changing diet or daily routine
Anxiety or depression
Some medical conditions, such as an underactive thyroid gland
","For information about persistent constipation and its possible treatments, see this resource on chronic idiopathic constipation.",Anal fissure postpartum,"Anal fissure can occur in pregnancy. During pregnancy, women often experience constipation due to the increased weight of the baby putting pressure on the rectum, the final segment of the digestive system, which stores feces until a person is ready to defecate.",Childbirth causes anal fissure in about one in 10 women.,Other anal fissure causes,Other possible causes of anal fissure include:[4][9],"
Persistent diarrhea
A sexually transmitted infection, such as anal herpes, which causes the tissues to become soft and fragile
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease
Trauma, for instance from anal intercourse or other insertion of foreign objects
Unusually tight anal sphincter muscles
","Often, no clear cause for anal fissure can be found. They are associated with tight anal sphincter muscles, though the cause of this is unknown.",Anal fissure diagnosis,A doctor may diagnose anal fissure based on description of the symptoms and a physical examination.,The physical examination usually involves gently separating the buttocks to allow a doctor to see the area around the anus.,"Most fissures appear in the 12 or 6 o’clock position. Those in other locations are likely to be associated with an underlying disorder, such as Crohn’s disease.","A doctor will usually avoid inserting anything into the anus, such as a gloved finger or small instrument, as this can cause substantial pain and is often unnecessary for provisional diagnosis.[3]","Anal fissure anoscopy, sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy","If the diagnosis is unclear, an anoscopy may be recommended. This involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a light and camera on the end into the anus to look for symptom causes in the intestine. However, anoscopy is avoided in cases of an acute anal fissure as it is normally not well tolerated. Often, the patient is at first treated solely on the basis of symptoms. Sometimes, topical anaesthetic is used to facilitate an anoscopy.","Those who have a chronic or recurrent anal fissure after surgical therapy may be evaluated further with anoscopy and sigmoidoscopy, a procedure similar to anoscopy, but which also examines the lower colon.[10]","Sometimes, a colonoscopy procedure is used to look for the presence of an underlying condition that may be causing an anal fissure, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBD). This is similar to an anoscopy and sigmoidoscopy, but which also examines the entire colon.",See this resource for information on preparing for a colonoscopy.,"Good to know: Anal fissures are sometimes misdiagnosed as hemorrhoids, delaying appropriate treatment, which may lead to an acute fissure becoming a chronic one, which is more difficult to treat. Wrong diagnosis of anal fissure may also allow other conditions to go undetected and untreated, such as infection and, though it is rare, anal cancer.[11]",Anal fissure treatment,Treatment of an anal fissure primarily aims to ease the pain,"Treatment begins with changing to a high-fiber diet, as well as maintaining sufficient fluid intake to soften feces and prevent further damage to the area while the wound is healing. Pain medication will also be given.","Usually, an anal fissure will heal with home treatment. In the case of chronic anal fissure, occasionally surgery will be recommended.",Anal fissure medicine,Anal fissure pain relief and other medicines may include:[9][12],Anesthetic cream or ointment,"This should be applied before going to the toilet. Anesthetic creams and ointments can be obtained by prescription, though some products are available without. Anesthetic should only be used for short periods of up to about five to seven days, otherwise the skin around the anus may become irritated.",Steroid cream or ointment,Steroids may be recommended to ease swelling if it is severe. This may help to relieve pain and any itching. Steroids should not be used for more than one week at a time.[5],Painkillers,"Ibuprofen and paracetamol can help to ease pain. Opioids should be avoided, as this can cause constipation.",Stool softening,"An anal fissure will heal more easily if feces is kept soft, so that it can pass more easily. A diet involving plenty of high fiber foods will help, such as fruit, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and seeds.",Stool softening medication may also be obtained on prescription or bought at pharmacies.,Glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) ointment,"These medications may be prescribed for chronic anal fissures, present for six weeks or more. This is applied to the skin to reduce the anal sphincter pressure and can decrease pain and facilitate further healing. Side effects include headache, so the correct amount must be used.",Anal fissure home treatment,Other general measures that are recommended alongside medicine for anal fissure may include:[4][9],"
Washing the area carefully with water after using the toilet, to avoid irritation and infection. Soap should be avoided as this may cause irritation, and the area should be gently dried.
Sitz baths for anal fissure may be recommended as they are thought to soothe and relax the anus muscles, relieving some of the painful internal sphincter muscle spasm. This involves sitting in plain, non-soapy water after defecation.
",Measures to avoid constipation and keep feces soft may include:[5][8],"
Eating plenty of fiber, such as is found in fruit, vegetables, cereals, wholemeal bread
Drinking plenty of liquids to soften stools. Adults should aim to drink two litres or more each day. It is best to avoid alcoholic drinks as they can cause dehydration.
Not putting off defecation, which can lead to bigger and harder stools forming, which may exacerbate the problem
",Anal fissure surgery and injections,There are further clinical treatments available for people who do not respond to topical therapy and home treatment measures. These may include:[5][12],Botulinum toxin,"Also known as botox, this compound, which temporarily paralyzes muscles for up to three months, can be injected into the anal sphincter. This may be done without anesthesia or sedation. This may lead to temporary, mild anal leakage of gas or feces.",Surgery,"The surgery recommended for treating an anal fissure is normally sphincterotomy, which aims to relax the anal sphincter by cutting the muscle in order to loosen the anal muscle, therefore improving blood supply and aiding healing. Incontinence is a possible complication from surgery, so it is only offered to people whose symptoms have persisted despite medicine for at least one to three months. Anal fissure surgery recovery time varies from person to person.",Anal fissure complications,Complications of anal fissure normally arise as a result of surgery. These may include:[13][14],"
Infection
Anal fistula, a small tunnel that develops between the end of the intestine and the anus
Incontinence
",Anal fissure in babies and children,"Anal fissures may also occur in children of any age, but are most common in toddlers. The child may scream when defecating and have bright red blood in their feces.","A common problem of anal fissure in children is that they will often deliberately avoid defecating, which may cause hardening of feces, leading to repeated re-tearing of the old fissure and preventing healing.","Even once the fissure has healed, a child may still be fearful of defecating. To break this cycle, it is important to give the child both feces-softening medication and laxatives to ensure regular defecation. The correct dose varies from child to child and may be gradually adjusted so that the child consistently produces large, soft feces.[15]","Good to know: Rarely, anal fissures in children could indicate sexual abuse, especially if other causes such as hard feces are not present.[4]",Anal fissure FAQs,"Q: Are there home remedies for anal fissure?
A: Yes, there are several measures for home treatment which may help. These include:","
Sitz bath or hip bath, which involves sitting in plain, non-soapy water after defecation to keep the area clean
Sitting on a warm heating pad or warm water bottle is thought to promote healing as heat increases blood flow to the area
","However, medical attention should always be sought where there is bleeding from the anus. It may indicate other conditions which must receive prompt treatment to ensure the best outcome, such as anal cancer.","Q: Anal fissure or herpes - which do I have?
A: It is possible to get Herpes, a sexually transmitted infection, in the anal area. This can bring about what feels like a fissure around the anus and may be mistaken for one. Anal fissure causes burning pain and bleeding during defecation. Herpes causes blisters, itching and pain around the anus, but not especially while defecating, and lesions from herpes are unlikely to bleed.",Herpes may cause flu-like symptoms and other associated problems such as pain with urination. Anal herpes normally has a history of sexual exposure to the herpes virus.
,,,,,,,,,,What is anaphylaxis?
,,,,,,,,,,What is anaphylaxis?,"Anaphylaxis, also known as anaphylactic shock or an anaphylactic reaction, is an extreme allergic reaction affecting multiple organ systems of the body. Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency and requires immediate medical treatment.","It is characterized by rapidly-developing, life-threatening airway and/or breathing and/or blood circulation problems, usually within minutes of exposure to a trigger substance, but sometimes after hours.","The overall frequency of anaphylaxis remains unclear, because some clinicians use the term anaphylaxis only for the full-blown syndrome, whereas others use it to describe cases with milder symptoms. Some figures have put the overall prevalence of anaphylaxis as 1-2 percent of the population as a whole.[1]","Triggers for anaphylaxis are different from person to person, but are often everyday things such as insect stings, rubber, certain medications such as penicillin, or foods such as nuts, fish, shellfish, dairy products and eggs.","The symptoms tend to worsen quickly and may include an itchy red rash anywhere on the body, coughing or wheezing, difficulty breathing, nausea, alterations in heart rate, a sense of impending doom and, eventually, collapse and loss of consciousness.","For people at high risk, it may be useful to carry around an emergency kit with an adrenaline injection, especially when traveling to areas where medical help is not readily available. If treated quickly and appropriately, most people recover well after an episode of anaphylaxis.","Anaphylactic reactions tend to be more common in children and teenagers, though adults can also have reactions when they are exposed to triggers. The onset of an anaphylactic allergy can occur at any age.",Symptoms,"The symptoms of anaphylaxis can come on, progress and become life-threatening very quickly.",The most common early symptoms of anaphylaxis include:[2][3],"
Itchy skin, sometimes developing into hives, a rash of raised, pink or red areas known as wheals
Wheezing, hoarseness and chest tightness
Swelling of the lips, tongue and throat, known as angioedema
Swelling of eyes, hands and feet
Reddening of the skin
Irritation and inflammation of the eyes and nasal passages
","As anaphylactic shock progresses, other symptoms may include:[2][4]","
A sense of impending doom
A fast or thumping heart
Stomach cramps, nausea and vomiting
",Advanced symptoms of anaphylaxis include:[2][4],"
A high-pitched wheezing sound, known as stridor
Fast, shallow breathing or complete inability to breathe
Bluish skin on the lips and tongue
Confusion, agitation and anxiety
A sudden feeling of weakness or dizziness
Loss of consciousness
",Types of anaphylactic reaction,Anaphylactic reactions may be divided into two main types:[2],"
Uniphasic reactions have symptoms that get rapidly worse, but once treated, the symptoms go and then do not return.
Biphasic reactions may be mild or severe to start with and then appear to disappear before symptoms increase, with breathing and blood pressure problems.
",Causes,Anaphylaxis is an extreme allergic response. Allergies occur when the immune system overreacts to a substance that it wrongly perceives as a threat. These substances are called allergens or triggers. Some people are sensitive to one or more allergens.,Good to know: Even a minute amount of an allergen can trigger an allergic reaction.[5],"In the case of anaphylaxis, the body’s allergic reaction goes into overdrive. The cells of the body release chemical substances which cause swelling in different areas.","This sets off a series of events which cause the body to lose control of its vital functions, the respiratory and/or cardiovascular system. The blood vessels widen, which leads to a drop in blood pressure. The tissues in the airways swell, which causes difficulty breathing and may completely block the airways. If air cannot be taken into the lungs, the blood cannot be oxygenated. Oxygenated blood is needed so that the cells of organs, such as the brain, can work. The heart muscle needs oxygen so that it can pump blood around the body. Once one major organ system starts to falter, the others become strained, potentially leading to failure of multiple organs and mortality.[4]",Triggers,The trigger for anaphylactic shock reactions vary from person to person. Some of the most common triggers include:[6][7],"
Certain foods, including nuts, shellfish, eggs, some fruits
Insect stings, particularly wasp stings and bee stings
Natural latex, also known as rubber, such as is found in condoms
Certain medications, including some antibiotics such as penicillin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), e.g. aspirin
General anaesthetic
Contrast agents: special dyes used in some medical tests
",Many cases of anaphylaxis have no known cause. This is called idiopathic anaphylaxis.,Risk factors,"There aren’t many known risk factors for anaphylaxis, but some factors that may increase risk include:[8]","
Previous anaphylaxis
Allergies or asthma
Certain other conditions, including mastocytosis, an abnormal accumulation of mast cells, which release histamine and other substances during allergic reactions
",Diagnosis,"The diagnosis is based on the recognition of symptoms occurring quickly and rapidly worsening. Treatment is not delayed in order to carry out further diagnostic tests, since an anaphylactic reaction is an emergency, and anyone with presumed anaphylaxis is treated as such.","After life-saving emergency treatment has been started and symptoms have been brought under control, a blood test can be done to identify anaphylaxis or rule out other causes of the symptoms. The blood test should be done as soon as possible and no later than four hours from the onset of symptoms. It measures mast cell tryptase, a chemical released by the immune system in a severe allergic reaction.[4][9]",Treatment,"Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening emergency and needs immediate treatment. Out of hospital, an ambulance must be called at once and the patient transported to an emergency department.[4]",First aid measures,"While waiting for medical attention, first aid measures should be implemented immediately, including:[4][10]",Adrenaline,"Adrenaline should be injected immediately, where possible. Many people who are susceptible to anaphylaxis will carry an adrenaline auto-injector, also known as an adrenaline pen or epinephrine. This is a pre-filled syringe with a needle, that can be injected by the person having the anaphylactic reaction or by a bystander who knows how to use it.","If there is no response to the initial injection, it is recommended to give a further adrenaline dose after five minutes. Adrenaline is effective very soon after being administered and wears off quite quickly.",Patient positioning,"A person in anaphylactic shock should be placed in a comfortable position. Depending on the symptoms experienced, different positions will be advised:","
A person who feels faint, due to low blood pressure, should lie flat with their legs raised. Sitting or standing may cause cardiac arrest, a sudden loss of blood flow resulting from the failure of the heart to pump effectively
A person with airway and breathing problems may prefer to sit up, as this makes breathing easier
An unconscious person who is still breathing should be placed on their side in the recovery position[11]
A pregnant person should lie on their left side to avoid caval compression,i.e. compression of a large vein that leads to low blood pressure
",Removing the trigger,"Removing the trigger for anaphylaxis is not always possible, but may involve, for example:",Removing the stinger from a bee sting. Early removal is more important than removal method.,Rinsing mouth to remove traces of a food allergen. Attempts to make a person vomit after food-induced anaphylaxis are not recommended.,Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR),"If the person is unresponsive and not breathing, CPR should be performed until the emergency services arrive. CPR is unlikely to make a person’s heart start beating again if it has stopped. However, it will pump some blood around the body, supplying organs and, most importantly, the brain with oxygen.","Good to know: If untrained, a person can still use hands-only CPR.",Hospital treatment,People with presumed anaphylaxis are treated in the emergency department. The specifics of treatment depend on how well or unwell the person experiencing an anaphylactic reaction is.,Treatment may include:[4][12],"
Adrenaline, also known as epinephrine, usually injected into the thigh muscle.
Intravenous fluids to raise the blood pressure
Oxygen and inhalant medications
Steroids and antihistamines
","In severe cases, a breathing tube may be necessary until the immune reaction settles.",Prevention and management,"If a person has had one anaphylactic reaction, they are very likely to have another if exposed to the same allergen again. Subsequent episodes of anaphylaxis are often worse than the first one.",There are several ways to manage the possibility of having another anaphylactic reaction:[13],Avoiding known triggers,It is important to take steps to avoid exposure to triggers. A person who has experienced anaphylaxis will be referred to a specialist allergy clinic to identify allergy triggers and for assessment and advice about how to avoid them in the future.,"Some people who have had an anaphylactic episode in response to common substances or medication choose to wear a piece of jewelry, often a bracelet which has their allergy engraved on it, to direct medical staff in the case of emergencies.[4]",Being prepared for future emergencies,"An epinephrine autoinjector should be carried at all times. They contain a prescribed single dose of anaphylaxis medication that is injected into the thigh during an anaphylactic emergency. A doctor will explain to the person affected how to use this. It is also important that other people in close contact, such as family members, also know how to use the autoinjector.","People at high risk of severe reactions should also have an anaphylaxis action plan for their school or workplace, which includes education on the prevention of exposure and how to act in cases of anaphylaxis.",Emergency anaphylaxis kits can also be prescribed in some cases. It is recommended that this include:[14],"An adrenaline injection, also known as an epinephrine pen, which is the most important. This works rapidly to reverse all signs of anaphylaxis, most importantly low blood pressure, poor heart rate, poor circulation, swelling and asthma.","H1 Antihistamine, which is particularly effective for skin symptoms and swelling, as a supporting medication to epinephrine.","H2 Antihistamine, which is particularly effective when there are cardiovascular symptoms, as a supporting medication. This will also reduce abdominal discomfort.",Allergen immunotherapy,"For some people, it is possible to undergo allergen immunotherapy, also known as desensitization or hyposensitization therapy, which means the body is slowly exposed to the trigger responsible for their anaphylaxis. This causes the immune system to get used to the trigger gradually, helping to reduce the severity of the allergic reaction in the future.[15]",FAQs,"Q: Anaphylaxis vs anaphylactoid reaction –  what is the difference?
A: Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening condition triggered by a wide range of allergens and involving multiple organ systems. It occurs after exposure to a foreign protein, known as an antigen, that stimulates the production of Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies. These travel to cells and, after subsequent exposure to the antigen, stimulate the release of the chemicals that cause an allergic reaction.","Anaphylactoid reactions appear to be exactly the same as anaphylactic reactions, but they do not involve previous exposure to the antigen. Anaphylactoid reactions are most commonly seen in reactions to contrast media used to increase the contrast of structures or fluids within the body for medical imaging.[16]","Q: Allergic reaction vs anaphylaxis – what is the difference?
A: An allergy is an immune response to something that the body mistakenly perceives as a threat, such as pollen or animal dander. In most cases, people with allergies develop mild to moderate symptoms, which develop locally in the skin or eyes, for example.","Sometimes, exposure to a triggering allergen can cause anaphylaxis. This happens when a person’s immune system over-releases chemicals, so that the reaction involves the respiratory and/or cardiovascular system, which can be life threatening."

","Medically speaking, anemia is broadly classified as macrocytic, microcytic or normocytic, depending on the size and volume of the red blood cells (erythrocytes):[6][7]","
Macrocytic anemia. In this category of anemia, the red blood cells are larger than normal. This includes anemia caused by vitamin B12 deficiency or folate deficiency.
Microcytic anemia. In this category of anemia, the red blood cells are smaller than normal. This includes anemia caused by iron deficiency, thalassemia or sickle cell disease.
Normocytic anemia. In this category of anemia, the red blood cells are normal in size, but fewer than normal in number. This includes anemia caused by chronic conditions, e.g. kidney disease.

,,,,,,,,,,What is an aortic dissection?
,,,,,,,,,,What is an aortic dissection?,"An aortic dissection is a serious condition in which a tear or split occurs in the inner layer of the aorta. The aorta is the largest blood vessel branching from the heart and supplies blood and oxygen to the entire body. If a tear occurs, blood is able to pass through the opening. This  can cause the inner and middle layers of the aorta to separate, or dissect.[1]","The condition is relatively rare, but most common in people between the ages of 50 and 65, tending to affect men more often than women. The main symptom is pain in the chest, upper back or abdomen.","An aortic dissection is a medical emergency requiring immediate treatment. In most cases, surgery will be necessary to repair the blood vessel.",Aortic dissection symptoms,"The main symptom of aortic dissection is a sudden, intense pain in the chest and upper back, commonly described as a shearing or ripping sensation. This pain may spread to the back, arms or legs, depending on the location of the dissection.",Other symptoms may include:,"
Shortness of breath
Cold hands or feet
Nausea
Sweating
Dizziness
General weakness
","People experiencing an aortic dissection may also lose consciousness, depending on the amount of blood that is lost from the blood vessel. Symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from those of other heart conditions, including heart attack and stroke.",Causes of aortic dissection,"An aortic dissection typically occurs in a weakened area of the aorta. According to the Stanford classification system, there are two types of the condition, each defined by which part of the aorta is affected:","
Type A: Tear occurs close to where the aorta exits the heart or in the upper aorta, known as the ascending aorta. May affect the upper aorta only or the upper aorta, as well as the lower aorta. Even if only a very small section of the upper aorta is affected and a large area of the lower aorta, this will still be classed as type A.
Type B: Tear occurs in the lower aorta, known as the descending aorta.
","The DeBakey classification system, on the other hand, identifies three types of aortic dissection:[2]","
Type I: Tear occurs in the ascending and descending aorta.
Type II: Tear occurs in the ascending aorta only.
Type III: Tear occurs in the descending aorta only.
",The type of aortic dissection being experienced may affect the treatment options available.,Risk factors,"Aortic dissection is more common in men than in women, and people between the ages of 50 and 65 are most at risk.",Other risk factors include:,"
High blood pressure
Smoking
High cholesterol levels
","People who already have a weakened or enlarged aorta – an aortic aneurysm – or who have experienced angina, a heart attack or stroke are also at an increased risk of aortic dissection. Less common causes are cocaine use and chest injuries, such as those experienced as a result of a car accident.","Certain genetic conditions are also known to increase the risk of aortic dissection; these include Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and Turner's syndrome.",Diagnosing aortic dissection,"The diagnosis is made by a doctor based on the symptoms and appearance of the affected person. In an emergency situation, an ultrasound scan may be carried out immediately to confirm the diagnosis.",Other tests that may help to confirm the diagnosis include:,"
Electrocardiogram (ECG)
X-rays of the chest and abdomen
CT scan (computed tomography)
MRI scan (magnetic resonance imaging scan)
",Aortic dissection treatment,"A type A, or type I and type II, aortic dissection is a medical emergency requiring surgery to repair the damaged aorta before complications can occur. Typically, a valve-sparing aortic root replacement, also known as a David procedure, will be performed.[3] This procedure preserves the aortic valve, grafting it to a new section of aortic tissue. In cases where the aortic valve is destroyed completely, it will typically be replaced with an artificial valve. This is major surgery carrying the risk of complications.","A type B, or type III, aortic dissection may not necessarily require surgery. Medication, such as beta blockers - these may be used to manage blood pressure - or a less invasive type of surgery, elective endovascular repair, may be performed to redirect blood flow away from the dissection.[4]","After initial treatment for both types of aortic dissection has been carried out, long-term use of blood pressure-lowering medication will typically be required. Many people will take this medication for the rest of their lives. Hospital visits, which may include CT and MRI scans, to check-up on the condition may also be necessary.[1]",Aortic dissection complications,"If effective treatment is not received, an aortic dissection can be life-threatening. This is commonly due to internal bleeding, but can also result from damage to an organ – stemming from a lack of blood flow to the organ – stroke, or damage to the heart’s aortic valve.[1]",Aortic dissection prevention,"Preventing an aortic dissection typically involves keeping blood pressure within a healthy range. To do this, a variety of lifestyle changes are recommended:","
Eating a healthy diet rich in vitamins, minerals, fruits and vegetables, and low in sugar, fat and carbohydrates
Exercising regularly
Maintaining a healthy weight
Quitting smoking or not starting in the first place
Avoiding drugs, such as cocaine, and other stimulants
","Preventive measures are particularly recommended for people within the at-risk groups for an aortic dissection. In combination with lifestyle changes, people with a history of high blood pressure should also take care to take their prescribed medication.",Other names for aortic dissection,"

There are three main types:[3],"
Minor aphthous ulcers are the most common variety. They are small in size – usually less than 5mm in diameter – and can form as a single ulcer or in a cluster. They are not typically very painful.
Major aphthous ulcers are less common, are generally 5mm or larger and form singularly or in a pair. They can be painful, especially when eating, and last anywhere between two weeks and a number of months.
Herpetiform ulcers occur when multiple pinpoint lesions fuse together and form large, irregularly shaped ulcers. Herpetiform ulcers are so called because of their similarity in appearance to herpes, however herpetiform ulceration is not caused by the herpes simplex virus.

The expanding uterus: As the uterus grows during pregnancy, the bowel is displaced, potentially leading to pain in the abdominal area.
Round ligament pain: The round ligaments, located at the front of the uterus, can cause sharp and sometimes severe pain as the uterus expands. Typically, this pain is in the lower half of the abdomen. While the person experiencing the pain may confuse this with appendicitis, a physician will be able to tell the difference.
Constipation and gas: Common during pregnancy, due to changes in the location of the gastrointestinal tract, which is pushed out of the way and compressed by the expanding uterus. Constipation and gas can cause mild to moderate pain in the whole abdominal region.
","At times, abdominal pain during pregnancy can be a result of more serious conditions.","Urinary tract infection: A treatable condition with symptoms including a sudden and/or frequent urge to urinate, pain when urinating and general abdominal pain.","Ectopic pregnancy: A condition that occurs when a fertilized egg implants itself somewhere other than the uterus, often causing severe abdominal pain.

Symptoms can include pain and cramps on the right and left of the lower abdominal region. It is often accompanied by vaginal bleeding, as well as the loss of fluid or tissue from the vagina.","Abdominal pain during pregnancy may also be the result of acute appendicitis. Appendicitis during pregnancy can be difficult to diagnose due to the movement of the appendix from its usual position to a higher position near the liver or belly button. In pregnant women, pain from acute appendicitis may be felt in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.[15] These symptoms should be reported to doctors as soon as they occur. To prevent complications, emergency surgical intervention is typically required.[17]","If you are concerned that you may have acute appendicitis, or are experiencing an ectopic pregnancy, or another problem that is causing you abdominal pain, try using the Ada app to find out what the cause is.",Appendix pain location in children,Pain in the region of the appendix in children may be a result of a variety of conditions. These include relatively non-serious conditions such as:[18],"
A buildup of gas
Constipation
Gastroenteritis
Mild food poisoning
A mild food allergy
","If abdominal pain lasts for longer than a day or is particularly severe, it could be a sign of a range of conditions including:","
Urinary tract infection
Hernia
Inflammatory bowel disease
Intussusception of the bowel, where a section of the intestine slides into the next, like a telescope folding up. This is rare and tends to affect the small intestine. However, it is a medical emergency.
","In some cases, appendicitis may be the cause of abdominal pain. Children with appendicitis often present with similar pain or symptoms as adults with the condition. Other symptoms of appendicitis in children include:","
Fever
Vomiting
Nausea
Lack of appetite
","It is important to ensure children receive medical attention as soon as possible if appendicitis is suspected. Treatment will usually involve an appendectomy. This is considered a routine procedure, but will involve a hospital stay.","If you are concerned that your child may have acute appendicitis or another stomach problem, Ada is ready to check their symptoms.",Complications of untreated appendix pain,"Acute appendicitis is a common disorder and is easily treated if it is diagnosed early. If it is not treated, the appendix may burst and this may lead to peritonitis.**",Peritonitis,"Peritonitis is uncommon, but when it does occur, it is a medical emergency. Peritonitis is an infection of the peritoneum, the lining of the abdominal cavity. If it occurs without an underlying cause, it is known as primary peritonitis. However, peritonitis is usually caused by disorders including:[19]","
Acute appendicitis, if the appendix bursts
Pancreatitis
Diverticulitis
Acute cholecystitis
Pelvic inflammatory disease
Penetrating injury of the abdomen, such as a stab wound or gunshot wound
",This list is not exhaustive. Many other abdominal disorders that involve inflammation can result in peritonitis if they are not treated.[15],"Peritonitis is the result of an infection spreading from an organ to the peritoneal tissue. The regions in which pain is felt and how severe the pain is, change as the infection spreads.[19]","Abdominal pain from peritonitis may be felt in several ways Generally, an infection affecting an organ in the abdomen will be painful, and as the infection spreads to the peritoneum nearest the organ, the pain will also spread. If the infection then spreads to the entire peritoneum, the pain will then be felt as general belly pain and tenderness.",Pain from peritonitis feels worse when the affected person flexes their hips or coughs; it is also painful if pressure is applied.[20] It will usually be most intense over the site of the organ that originally began the infection.,Other symptoms of peritonitis may include:,"
Fever, with a body temperature of 38 C/ 100.4 F
Low blood pressure
Fast heartbeat
Low output of urine
Septic shock in severe cases
","If you are concerned that you may have peritonitis, a burst appendix or another problem that is causing you abdominal pain and distress, share your symptoms with Ada.",Appendix pain relief,"Relief from abdominal pain will generally depend on its underlying cause. When caused by acute appendicitis, the standard treatment option is surgery, which will usually take the form of an appendectomy. If a person experiencing moderate or severe abdominal pain is concerned and shows no improvement within a reasonable amount of time, they should seek medical help.","An appendectomy involves the complete removal of the appendix, sometimes following a course of antibiotics to reduce inflammation and make surgery easier. Keyhole surgery is generally used during this procedure, allowing for a shorter recovery time and less scarring. Generally, there are no long-term complications following an appendectomy.","It is more likely that abdominal pain is the result of gastroenteritis, gas, or food poisoning than acute appendicitis. It may be best to treat for these first, before seeking emergency medical help. About 179 million cases of acute gastroenteritis are reported every year in the USA, but only 7% of the population will have appendicitis in their lifetime, making gastroenteritis more common than appendicitis.[21][22] Gastroenteritis](/conditions/gastroenteritis/) generally includes diarrhea and vomiting, with nausea and abdominal pain, and sometimes fever.","Treatment of gastroenteritis and food poisoning includes bed rest, oral rehydration, and medication to manage nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.[23] However, If there is no improvement in symptoms within a reasonable time with this treatment, then a physician should be consulted urgently.","If you are concerned that you may have acute appendicitis, gastroenteritis or another problem that is causing you abdominal pain, use Ada to check your symptoms.",Appendix pain FAQs,"Q: In what location do you experience appendix pain?
A: In most cases of appendicitis, the pain will typically begin around the stomach or belly button area and move to the lower right side of the abdomen, while also becoming sharper and more severe.","Q: Why is appendix pain sometimes felt on the left?
A: In most cases, pain from acute appendicitis is felt on the right. However, some people experience it on the left. This occurs when the inflammation affecting the appendix spreads to the peritoneum, the lining of the abdominal cavity.","A common test that can distinguish possible appendicitis from other abdominal pain uses rebound tenderness to determine whether it is the appendix that is inflamed, or another structure. In this test, the doctor slowly presses their fingers on a part of the abdomen that does not hurt - in the case of suspected acute appendicitis, this would be the left-hand side - and then quickly lets go. The affected person feels pain in the lower right abdominal area. This sort of pain is known as “contralateral rebound tenderness”, as pain occurs on the side opposite to where the pressure is applied.","In very few cases, the reason for appendix pain being felt on the left may be because of a hereditary condition known as situs inversus, in which the organs of the chest and abdomen are in mirror-image positions – that is, they are on the opposite side to where they are in most people.[24] In people with situs inversus, for example, the liver and appendix are on the left of the abdomen. However, situs inversus only affects about one in 8000 people, and it is far more likely that, if you feel appendix pain on the left, it is because of rebound tenderness.[25]"
,,,,,,,,,,What is arthritis?
,,,,,,,,,,What is arthritis?,Arthritis is a very common condition characterized by inflammation of one or more joints.,"The key symptoms of arthritis include pain, stiffness and swelling. Arthritis can be localized to one joint or it can affect many joints, and can affect different structures inside a joint, such as the synovium (joint lining), bones, cartilage, or supporting tissues. The symptoms can also vary in severity and frequency. Some forms of arthritis are short term conditions, while others are long-term, and may permanently damage joint function.","According to the Centers for Disease Control, about one in four adults in the U.S. have arthritis (54 million).[1] Many forms of arthritis tend to predominantly affect older people, though it can affect people at any age and there are some conditions, generally rare, that cause arthritis in children and teenagers.","There are many possible causes of arthritis, such as age-related wear and tear, autoimmune conditions, infections, injuries and others. Each type of arthritis tends to be characterized by which joints are affected and the usual age at which people are affected.","A range of treatment options are available for arthritis, with the chosen option dependent on the type of arthritis and its causes. Some types of arthritis respond well to treatment, while other types are more hard to control.","Different types of arthritis and symptoms, causes and treatment",There are many different types of arthritis – some sources estimate over 200 – with differing causes and symptoms.[2],"Most, though not all, types of arthritis can be sorted by cause into two overarching categories:","Inflammatory arthritis: All arthritis is characterized by inflammation, which is part of the body’s healing process. However, in the case of inflammatory arthritis, inflammation generally occurs for no obvious reason. This is known as an autoimmune condition. The most common form of inflammatory arthritis is rheumatoid arthritis. Types of inflammatory arthritis generally causes stiffness in the joints following rest, such as just after getting out of bed in the morning.","Degenerative or mechanical arthritis covers types of arthritis in which there is damage to the joints through wear and tear. The most common form of degenerative arthritis is osteoarthritis. Types of degenerative arthritis tend to worsen with movement and weight bearing and be relieved by rest. They also tend to be more common in older people. Types of degenerative arthritis tend to affect joints asymmetrically, meaning they don't appear in the same joints on both sides of the body.","Doctors categorize arthritis by whether the symptoms are symmetric (same joints on both sides of the body) or asymmetric, and by the number of joints affected.",The most common types of arthritis include:,Osteoarthritis,"Osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis, with more than 30 million adults in the U.S affected by the condition.[3] It is a degenerative arthritis, most often occurring in the hands, hips and knees.","The main symptoms of osteoarthritis are deep, achy joint pain that worsens with activity, decreased range of movement and stiffness during rest, known as gelling. It generally affects several joints. It is most common in women leading up to and after menopause.[4] Athletes are also at increased risk of osteoarthritis, due to repeated use of particular joints.","The condition is caused by damage to or breakdown of joint cartilage, a connective tissue that covers the ends of long bones at the joints, as well as other areas of the joint organ.[5] In normal joints, cartilage acts as a shock absorber and allows bones to slide over one another. Osteoarthritis damage may occur as a result of joint injury or overuse.","Treatment includes regular exercise, hot or cold compresses, working towards a healthy weight if overweight, physical and occupational therapy, and pain medication. In severe cases, surgery may repair, strengthen or replace a damaged joint.",Rheumatoid arthritis,Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the second most common type of arthritis and the most common type of inflammatory arthritis.,"Symptoms of RA occur in flare-ups, when symptoms of pain and swelling are worse, and periods of improved or no symptoms. It usually affects the hands, feet and wrists. Usually the joints are affected symmetrically, and many joints may be inflamed. Rheumatoid arthritis can also cause inflammation in other  parts of the body, such as the lungs, heart and eyes. Other common symptoms include symptoms such as fever, fatigue and weight loss.","Rheumatoid arthritis is especially common in women and in smokers.[4] The age of onset for rheumatoid arthritis is usually after 35 years old, however, it becomes more common with age, and most people are diagnosed in their 60s.[6] The condition can, however occur at any age and normally worsens with time.","Over time, the ongoing inflammation can cause damage to the bones of the joint, which in turn causes changes to the shape and alignment of the joint. This may lead to an inability to do activities which use the affected joints. However, rheumatoid arthritis inflammation can normally be well managed with medications to slow down the immune system, called disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDS), as well as pain medications for relief of symptoms. Surgery is sometimes carried out in cases where a joint becomes badly damaged. There is currently no specific cure for rheumatoid arthritis.",Gout,"Gout is an inflammatory arthritis causing attacks of pain and inflammation in one or more joints. It is a very common condition, which is more common in men and increasingly common with age.","Gout is caused by a chemical called uric acid in the blood. It is usually caused by having persistently high levels of uric acid in the blood. A sudden decrease in the uric acid level, as can be caused by uric acid-lowering medications, can sometimes also trigger an attack of symptoms.","This is often caused either by excess amounts of uric acid being produced, or not enough being excreted from the urine on a chronic basis. Any abrupt increase in the level of uric acid in the blood may also trigger an attack of podagra orand gout. Uric acid can crystallize and settle in one or more joints, which may initiate an immune response, causing the characteristic inflammation of gout.","Most people with elevated blood levels of uric acid will never develop podagra and gout, and gout is not always associated with elevated uric acid blood levels; the condition can also occur despite there being normal levels of uric acid at the point in time when blood levels are measured.[4]","Uric acid is a chemical increased in the body by eating some foods, especially oily fish, red meat, organ meats such as liver or kidneys, drinking alcohol, conditions such as high blood pressure or obesity, as well as taking certain medications.","Gout tends to start with severe pain in one joint, often that of the big toe, where it is known as podagra, before later beginning to affect other joints. People with gout may experience fever and fatigue. In cases of chronic, untreated gout, usually after about ten years, a person may develop tophi, which are uric acid crystal deposits appearing as firm, yellowish nodules on the joint.[7]",Treatment often involves avoiding foods that cause gout and taking medications to relieve pain and inflammation and decrease the amount of uric acid in the body. Many people are able to manage and avoid episodes of gout using these measures.[8],Psoriatic arthritis,"Psoriatic arthritis is a long-term inflammatory arthritis that is associated with psoriasis, a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin with silvery scales, known as plaques. Some people also have symptoms in their fingernails or eyes. About one or two in every five people with psoriasis will develop psoriatic arthritis.[9] Some people with psoriatic arthritis, however, will never develop the skin condition.","Psoriatic arthritis is an autoimmune condition thought to be triggered by a combination of genetic, immune and environmental factors, such as certain infections and joint injury.[10]","The condition is progressive, damaging the joints over time. However, with medication it is possible to slow down the progression of the arthritis and minimize joint damage. The condition varies widely in severity and the number of joints affected. It tends to occur in flare-ups and periods of improved or no symptoms. There are different typical patterns of psoriatic arthritis, affecting certain groups of joints, most often the distal joints, the end joints of the fingers and toes. Most commonly, psoriatic arthritis is asymmetric, not affecting the same joints on both sides of the body, and causes symptoms in several joints at once.","Psoriatic arthritis is treated with medications which suppress the immune system, called disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDS), as well as over-the-counter medications, such as ibuprofen, to reduce pain and swelling. Ideally, one medication should be taken to treat both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis when both conditions are present together.","People with other types of arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis, may also have psoriasis without the two conditions being linked.",Septic arthritis,"Septic arthritis is an infection in a joint, causing inflammation. It is usually caused by bacteria, though it may be caused by other microorganisms, such as a fungus.[11]","This condition can affect anyone, but most commonly occurs in association with prosthetic joints and other joint surgeries. It is caused by infectious agents reaching the joints, either directly, as in the case of surgery, or indirectly, reaching the joints via the bloodstream. Risk is increased in older people and those with diabetes or a suppressed immune system.","Symptoms involve severe pain, swelling, redness and heat in affected joints. They usually develop quickly, over a few hours or days. Many people with this condition also develop a fever. If the infection becomes widespread, affected people may also experience nausea, vomiting, dizziness or drowsiness.","Many people will need to stay in hospital for two weeks or more to have pus drained from the joint and intravenous antibiotics. Surgery may be needed to further drain pus or to replace an infected joint prosthesis. With antibiotic treatment and proper management, most people will recover well. Without treatment, septic arthritis may lead to permanent joint damage and can be life-threatening.",Reactive arthritis,"Reactive arthritis (ReA), formerly known as Reiter’s syndrome, Reiter’s disease or Reiter’s arthritis, is a relatively short-lived inflammatory arthritis. Reactive arthritis develops as a reaction to certain bacterial infections, most often genital tract or bowel infections. Reactive arthritis is not an infection of the joints. It is more common in younger people than other forms of arthritis.","Reactive arthritis generally begins one to four weeks after a bacterial infection and can last for up to six months. Some people experience repeated bouts of symptoms, and a few may develop chronic, usually mild arthritis.","Symptoms can range in severity from mild to severe, often appearing suddenly, lasting for several months and stopping within about six months. Symptoms often include asymmetric, oligoarticular inflammation of between two and five joints, red eyes and painful urination.","Typically, reactive arthritis is triggered by chlamydia, but can also be triggered by other infections, such as food poisoning.","There is no treatment specifically for reactive arthritis, but the condition normally stops on its own. Treatment involves antibiotics to treat the triggering infection and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to treat joint symptoms of inflammation and pain. Physiotherapy may be advised to keep the affected joints moving, in order to help retain flexibility and strength until symptoms subside.",Ankylosing spondylitis and other spondyloarthropathies,"Ankylosing spondylitis is a lifelong inflammatory arthritis involving back pain. The word ankylosing means joining together or fusing, and spondylitis means inflammation of the spine. The condition causes the affected spine joints to fuse together into one bone. Inflammation causes the bone-making cells to grow bone within the ligaments, which then may form bony bridges between the vertebrae of the spine. The cause of the condition is unknown, but there is normally a genetic component. Smoking is known to make the disease more severe. The condition mainly affects the lower back, but can spread up the spine and also affect other joints.","Symptoms usually include back pain and stiffness, inflammation in other joints, and extreme tiredness. Onset normally occurs gradually in early adulthood, between the ages of 20 and 30.[12] Severity of symptoms varies widely. It is associated with a serious but treatable eye condition called uveitis.","Treatment involves physiotherapy and exercise, painkillers such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and medication to suppress the immune system.",Secondary arthritis,"Some conditions may commonly cause the symptoms of arthritis, although the condition does not predominantly affect the joints. These include:[13][14]","Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), also known as lupus, is a long-term autoimmune condition that may cause inflammation in almost every part of the body, commonly including joint pains, as well as skin rashes and tiredness.","Paget’s disease of bone is a condition in which the normal cycle of bone renewal is disrupted, which can weaken the bones and in some cases cause them to become deformed. Osteoarthritis is a common complication of Paget’s disease.","Viral arthritis is inflammation of a joint caused by a viral infection. Some viruses have a tendency to affect the joints, such as dengue fever and mumps. This type of arthritis is normally self-limiting and requires no specific intervention.",Juvenile idiopathic arthritis,"Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), previously known as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis or juvenile chronic arthritis, is a chronic inflammatory arthritis, that occurs in children under 16 years old. It is the most common autoimmune joint condition in children.","It is not known exactly what causes the autoimmune condition, but it is associated with inherited factors and may be triggered by infection.[15]",Juvenile idiopathic arthritis tends to affect children younger than 10 but does not generally affect those younger than 6 months old. Girls are more commonly affected than boys and tend to manifest symptoms at a younger age.,"There are different types of juvenile arthritis, with varying symptoms. All types of JIA involve pain, swelling and stiffness of one or more joints. Many children will also experience fever with this condition.","Treatment often involves taking medications that dampen the immune system. Many children with this condition live well with treatment, and find that their symptoms improve over time. Many children will grow out of JIA, though it is not possible to accurately predict this.",Diagnosing arthritis,"In order to receive appropriate treatment, it is important to fully describe the nature of joint pain to the doctor, making sure to include information such as:","
How long you have been experiencing joint inflammation and pain
The location and severity of the pain
If any family members have experienced arthritis or autoimmune conditions
Whether there are other symptoms that occur besides the joint inflammation and pain
","Following the investigation of a person’s medical history, a doctor will typically perform a physical exam to check for swollen joints or loss of motion, and use blood tests and X-rays to confirm a diagnosis and distinguish the type of arthritis.[16]",Treating arthritis,"It is always important to seek prompt diagnosis and treatment of arthritis, as well as any other associated conditions, in order to prevent joint damage, which can lead to physical disability. Arthritis treatment will vary, depending on the type of arthritis, but generally may include:","
Rest
Exercise
Medication
Occupational or physical therapy
In some cases, surgery
",FAQs,"Q: How many types of arthritis exist?
A: Some sources estimate that there are over 200 different types of arthritis and related diseases. Arthritis can range from mild to severe. Causes are normally either degenerative “wear-and-tear” of cartilage, such as with osteoarthritis, or inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. Together all of these forms of arthritis make up the most chronic illness in the U.S. It is important to find out which type of arthritis is present, as each condition will have a different underlying cause, progression and treatment.","Q: Are there home remedies for arthritis?
A: Yes, there are a number of home remedies for arthritis, which may help to relieve symptoms, but will not have a significant impact on the progress of the disease. Some of the most regularly cited include:","
Using heat pads or ice packs
Swimming
Omega-3, which is found in fish, canola oil and supplements
","However, if arthritis is suspected, professional medical attention should always be sought.","Q: What are some risk factors for arthritis?
A: Although it depends on the type of arthritis, some factors increase the risks of several different types. Arthritis risk factors include:[17][18]","
Smoking tobacco
Being overweight
Certain inherited traits, such as HLA-B27, a gene associated with autoimmune conditions
Increasing age
Joint injury or certain repetitive movements

Symptoms are usually well managed with medication and by avoiding things that are known to make symptoms worse. People experiencing possible symptoms of asthma can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.",Risks,"The main risk factors are genetic (having a blood relative with the condition) and environmental. Asthma affects both children and adults. Exposure to allergens, air pollution including smoking, or certain medications (like aspirin) may trigger an attack. Dust, animal hair, perfumes and stress are also triggers.",Symptoms,"An asthma attack occurs when tiny muscles around the airways tighten, the airway lining becomes inflamed, and mucus builds up, causing even more airway restriction. Typical symptoms include shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing, and chest tightness.",People experiencing possible symptoms of asthma can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.,Diagnosis,"Diagnosis is usually made by assessing symptom patterns and with a measurement of airflow through the lungs, called spirometry.",Treatment,"Asthma treatment consists of various medications with targeted effects. These might be taken as needed or, if a person suffers symptoms regularly, they might need to be taken every day. For example, inhaled corticosteroids aim to reduce the inflammation that leads to airway swelling and narrowing. Another medication called beta-agonists relax the small muscles that narrow airways during an asthma attack. Overall, the medications aim to open the airways, improve airflow, and make breathing easier.",Prevention,Prevention may be achieved by avoiding known allergens.
,,,,,,,,,,What is atherosclerosis?
,,,,,,,,,,What is atherosclerosis?,"Atherosclerosis is a condition in which fatty deposits, known as plaque or atheroma, build up within the walls of the arteries. Over time, these deposits of plaque may become larger, narrowing the arteries and restricting blood flow to certain organs.","Atherosclerosis is related to a number of cardiovascular conditions, including coronary heart disease and stroke. There are a variety of risk factors associated with the condition, with some of the most common including high cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking and obesity.","Although atherosclerosis is a potentially serious condition, it can be managed through lifestyle changes and treatment of its underlying causes.[1]","Atherosclerosis is a specific variety of arteriosclerosis, though the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Arteriosclerosis refers to a hardening and loss of elasticity in the arteries, which can lead to the same complications as those associated with atherosclerosis.[2]",Causes of atherosclerosis,"Atherosclerosis is caused by a buildup of plaque in the artery walls. Plaque is composed of calcium, cholesterol, fats and other substances found in the blood. If it hardens, plaque can block the arteries and restrict blood flow.[3]","A number of pre-existing conditions, lifestyle choices and other factors can make atherosclerosis more likely.

",Conditions associated with atherosclerosis,"Atherosclerosis may partially, or totally, block the arteries in the heart, brain, legs, arms, pelvis or kidneys. If this occurs, various conditions can result. These include:",Heart disease,"A buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries, which supply oxygen-enriched blood to the heart, can lead to a significant narrowing of these arteries. If this happens, the blood flow to the heart is restricted – a condition which is called coronary artery disease or coronary heart disease. It is the most common condition associated with atherosclerosis.","Coronary heart disease can cause angina – feelings of pain, squeezing or tightening in the chest. Furthermore, if one of the plaques ruptures, or a clot of blood or fat gets stuck in the narrowed blood vessel, a heart attack may occur; this is a leading cause of mortality in the USA.[5][6][7]",Cerebrovascular conditions,"Atherosclerosis can lead to a range of cerebrovascular conditions, including stroke and transient ischemic attack, sometimes called a mini-stroke. These conditions occur when plaque builds up in the arteries leading to the brain, restricting blood flow and starving the brain of oxygen.[8]",Peripheral arterial disease,"Peripheral arterial disease generally refers to a narrowing of the arteries in any location other than the heart or brain, with the legs being the most commonly affected area. Atherosclerosis is one of the main causes of this condition. When affecting the legs, peripheral arterial disease is characterized by pain in the calves, especially when walking or exercising.[9]",Vascular dementia,"Vascular dementia is a condition that results in memory loss, thinking problems and issues with language as a result of a reduced supply of blood to the brain. Along with Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia is one of the most common types of dementia.",Chronic kidney disease,"Chronic kidney disease develops when the kidneys become unable to perform properly their function of filtering excess water and other waste products from the blood. A buildup of plaque in the arteries of the kidneys can cause chronic kidney disease, which can eventually lead to kidney failure.[10]",Erectile dysfunction,"Atherosclerosis is among the leading causes of erectile dysfunction, the condition of being unable to get or maintain an erection. An erection is caused by a rush of blood to the penis. When the blood vessels in the penis begin to narrow, blood flow is restricted, causing erectile dysfunction.[11]",Diagnosing atherosclerosis,"Diagnosing atherosclerosis will generally involve a doctor looking at an individual’s medical history, a physical examination and a range of tests.","During the physical examination, a stethoscope will normally be used to listen to the individual’s heartbeat and blood flow in the vessels. The medical professional will take special care to listen for sounds that indicate the narrowing of the blood vessels, which can often indicate the presence of plaque and clogged arteries.",Tests that may aid a diagnosis of atherosclerosis include:[12],"
Blood pressure measurement: A doctor will check whether the readings are out of range.
Blood tests: To check the levels of fats, sugars, cholesterol and protein in the blood.
Electrocardiogram (EKG): A method for testing the electrical activity of the heart.
Chest X-ray: An image of the organs and blood vessels within the chest is taken, allowing doctors to check for abnormalities.
Echocardiography: An ultrasound is used to create an image of the heart. This can give doctors a holistic picture of the heart’s health.
Computed tomography (CT) scan: A computer-generated image of the body is created, allowing doctors to see signs of artery narrowing or hardening.
Angiography: A contrast dye is injected into specific blood vessels, which can then be visualized by X-ray. Catheters are often used. This test allows doctors to see signs of atherosclerosis.

,,,,,,,,,,What is atopic dermatitis?,"Atopic dermatitis, often called atopic eczema, is a common skin condition that typically causes dry, scaly, itchy, inflamed skin. The condition is particularly common in children under 5 years old, but may persist into later life. Atopic dermatitis is also known as infantile atopic dermatitis or baby eczema when it affects infants and young children.","Treatment typically involves keeping the skin moist and using creams or medications to soothe inflammation. Many children with atopic dermatitis will find that the condition improves over time, and that the symptoms of the condition disappear by adolescence. Some people, however, will experience atopic eczema into adulthood.",Symptoms of atopic dermatitis,The symptoms of atopic dermatitis will usually appear before the age of 5. Typical symptoms of the condition include:[1],"
Itchiness of the skin, which may intensify at nighttime
Patches of red, inflamed skin
Small bumps on the skin
Skin flaking
","Atopic dermatitis is usually confined to one area of the body, though it can affect multiple areas in severe cases. Areas of skin which are near skin creases – such as the elbows, wrists, back of the knees and neck – are the most commonly affected areas. In infants, the face is the most commonly affected area.","Thickened skin or scars can develop from scratching or rubbing. If the affected area becomes infected, thick, yellow pus, as well as redness and crusting may appear.","The symptoms experienced, as well as the severity and duration of a flare-up, will differ from person to person.",Causes of atopic dermatitis,"The causes of atopic dermatitis are not yet fully understood. What is known is that the lipid (oily) barrier of skin is diminished in people with the condition and that substances, or cytokines, released by cells in the immune system may be a factor. The reason why these things affect some people and not others is unknown, however.[2]","There is a genetic element to atopic dermatitis. If both parents have the condition, a child stands roughly an 80 percent chance of inheriting it themselves; if only one parent has the condition, this figure drops to 60 percent.[2]",Risk factors,"Atopic dermatitis is a common condition, especially in children younger than 5 years old. It is uncommon to experience a first episode in adulthood.","People with atopy – a predisposal to allergic conditions such as hay fever and allergic asthma, for example, tend to have a slightly higher chance of developing atopic dermatitis.

",Treatment for atopic dermatitis aims to reduce the number and severity of flare-ups by reducing skin irritation and promoting skin health.,Emollients,"Emollients are lotions, creams, ointments and bathing additives that help to prevent the skin from becoming dry, one of the key characteristics of atopic dermatitis. Keeping the skin moist helps to protect the skin from various irritants, which reduces the number of flare-ups experienced.","Depending on the severity of the condition, emollients may need to be applied between two and several times per day. They are most effective when applied directly after bathing – within three minutes – and should be applied liberally.[5] The most effective emollients are generally thick and contain little water, though a doctor, dermatologist or pharmacist will be able to advise on the best variety for each person.","Good to know: It is advisable to manage atopic dermatitis using products which have been specifically recommended for the use of people with the condition. Many commercial skincare products contain perfumes, and/or other chemicals which could irritate sensitive skin.",Steroid creams and ointments,"Steroid creams and ointments, otherwise known as topical steroids, are used to reduce skin inflammation. They come in various strengths, from mild to very potent, with the stronger varieties being more effective at treating inflammation but with a greater risk of side-effects. Possible side-effects include a mild stinging when applied, and, more rarely, thinning of the skin, skin discoloration, acne and increased hair growth.[4]","For this reason, the long-term regular use of topical steroids is not recommended, and a course of this type of medication will typically need to be used for between 7 and 14 days. Commonly, a mild steroid will first be prescribed, followed by a stronger variety if the flare-up does not clear up within three to seven days. The cream or ointment will usually need to be applied liberally once or twice per day. In very severe cases, a short-course of steroid tablets may be prescribed to help manage symptoms when topical steroids have proven ineffective.",Other treatment methods,Additional treatment methods for atopic dermatitis include:[1][4],"
Antihistamine tablets; sometimes used to help manage the itching associated with atopic dermatitis. They can be very effective but tend to cause drowsiness in some people.
Ultraviolet light therapy; generally only recommended for people who have not responded to other treatment methods due to the expense as well as the possible risk of skin cancer.
Immunosuppressive drugs; sometimes used in severe cases when no other treatment methods have proven effective. Can cause serious side-effects, including an increased risk of infection.
Wet dressings can be used to hydrate and soothe the skin during a flare-up.
",Atopic dermatitis prevention,Identifying and avoiding triggers that may cause symptoms to worsen can help in preventing episodes of atopic dermatitis.,Triggers to avoid may include:,"
Hot, dry environments
Perspiration
Certain chemicals and solutions, such as detergents, perfumes and cosmetics
Wool or synthetic clothing
","Once triggers have been identified, a person’s doctor or dermatologist will be able to help with devising methods of avoiding them.",Other methods of preventing atopic dermatitis from worsening include blotting the skin dry instead of rubbing after bathing as well as ensuring the fingernails of children are kept short to prevent wounds from scratching.,Atopic dermatitis complications,The skin of people with atopic dermatitis is susceptible to infection. This infection can be both bacterial and viral in origin.,Bacterial skin infection,"Skin that has become cracked as a result of atopic dermatitis is prone to bacterial infection. If infected, the usual symptoms of the condition may become more severe and treatments may cease to be effective.",Additional signs and symptoms of a bacterial skin infection include:[6],"

",Seek medical attention if any of these signs or symptoms appear. Antibiotics will typically be prescribed to treat the infection.,Viral skin infection,"People with atopic dermatitis are also susceptible to viral infections, particularly the herpes simplex virus. This can lead to a condition known as atopic dermatitis with eczema herpeticum.[7]",Symptoms of atopic dermatitis with eczema herpeticum include:[6],"
Rapidly worsening areas of painful dermatitis
Clusters of fluid-filled blisters which may burst to leave shallow open sores

",Atopic dermatitis with eczema herpeticum requires urgent medical treatment. Contact a doctor immediately if any of the signs or symptoms appear.,Atopic dermatitis FAQs,"Q: Do I need to see a specialist?
A: In most cases, a general practitioner will be capable of diagnosing and treating atopic dermatitis. However, if the usual treatment methods prove ineffective, it is not clear what is causing the condition and/or the dermatitis is particularly severe, the affected person may be recommended to a dermatologist, a specialist skin doctor. A dermatologist will be able to give additional support, including helping to identify any triggers and devising alternative treatment methods.[4]","Q: Are there any home treatment methods for atopic dermatitis?
A: There are several ways in which to treat the symptoms of atopic dermatitis at home.

,,,,,,,,,,What is attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)?
,,,,,,,,,,What is attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)?,"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common condition diagnosed in children who display symptoms of hyperactivity, inattention and/or impulsivity. Although its causes are not fully understood, factors including genetics and antenatal problems are thought to play a role.[1]","Treatment for the condition will generally involve a team of professionals experienced in child development and ADHD specifically. It may encompass parent-training and the setting of stricter boundaries at home, as well as behavioral therapy and medication. With adequate support, children with ADHD can learn to manage their symptoms effectively.",Symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),"The symptoms of ADHD may first be recognised by a parent, teacher or caregiver. They can in some cases be difficult to distinguish from age-appropriate energeticness and/or misbehavior.","The core symptoms are persistent hyperactivity, inattention and/or impulsivity. These behaviors should be displayed in more than one setting – for example, at home and at school – and during more than one activity – for example, when doing schoolwork and when going to bed.","To be classed as ADHD, the symptoms must:[1]","
First appear before the age of 12
Occur in more than one setting
Occur for at least six months
Interfere with social, academic and/or occupational activities
Be unrelated to any other condition or disorder that the child may have
","The symptoms of ADHD tend to vary from child to child. There are, however, three key subtypes that most cases will fit into.[1][2]","
Hyperactive-impulsive subtype: Hyperactivity and impulsivity commonly occur together in young children with ADHD. This may mean that a child feels the need to move around constantly, talk a lot and may struggle with controlling their impulses.
Inattention subtype: The main features of this subtype are difficulty paying attention and reduced cognitive ability. This may mean that a child is easily distracted, struggles to take in and follow instructions, and is forgetful. The symptoms of inattention will typically not become apparent until a child is eight or nine years old.[3]
Combined subtype: Children with this subtype will display features of both the hyperactive and inattention subtypes.
","Hyperactivity in children with ADHD tends to fade after the age of eight or nine and may be difficult to detect to outside observers from then on. The adolescent, however, may still experience restlessness or find it difficult to settle down. Symptoms of impulsivity and inattention tend to persist throughout a person's life, although inattention may not be detectable until the age of eight or nine.",Causes of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),"The exact cause of ADHD is not fully understood by medical professionals, though a number of factors are believed to play a role.",Factors that are thought to contribute to ADHD include:[1][3][4][5],"
Brain function and structure: Research suggests that there are small differences in the brains of people with ADHD compared with the brains of people without the condition. The significance of this is not yet clear.
Genetics: Research suggests that a child is more likely to develop ADHD if a close family member, such as a parent or sibling, also has the condition.
Learning issues: While learning issues do not cause ADHD, children with conditions such as dyslexia, dyscalculia and dysgraphia are more likely to also experience ADHD.
Antenatal problems: If a mother smokes, drinks alcohol or takes drugs during pregnancy, this may increase the likelihood of the child having ADHD.
Birth problems: If a child is born with a low birth weight, is deprived of oxygen during birth or experiences any other kind of issue during birth, this may increase their chance of developing ADHD.
","One or more of these factors may apply to a child with ADHD. Conversely, none of these factors may apply and there may be no clear cause of the condition.",Diagnosing attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),"The diagnosis is usually made by a specialist pediatric doctor with experience in child development. There is no special test for ADHD; instead, a diagnosis will be based on the symptoms displayed and through an observation of the child’s interactions with their parents, siblings and, if possible, teachers and classmates.",Seeking a formal diagnosis is important because it enables families and teachers to coordinate plans for managing behavior and education.,Treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),"The way in which a child with ADHD is treated will depend on the severity of the condition as well as the age of the child. Treatment should be coordinated by a team of professionals, including pediatricians, ADHD specialists and behavioral therapists.","The condition cannot be cured, but it can be effectively managed. The first stage of treatment will usually involve referral to a parent-training programme. The aim of this kind of training is to teach parents ways to manage behavioral problems, to understand the condition more thoroughly and to communicate more effectively with their child. These methods may also need to be taught to teachers and other caregivers, so activities can be tailored to suit the child’s attention span.[1]","Other treatments include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a method of psychological training that can help a child to understand why they act as they do and to come up with strategies to help manage their condition.","All children, including those with ADHD, are recommended to get at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity activity per day. Regular physical activity is associated with improved cardiovascular health, mental wellbeing and cognitive performance.",Medication can also be prescribed to help treat ADHD in children over the age of six. Methylphenidate is the most commonly prescribed medication. It works by increasing the amount of dopamine released into the parts of the brain responsible for attention and self-control. A child may need to take medication for a number of years.[1],"Medication is generally prescribed in severe cases of ADHD or in milder cases when other treatment options have not been effective. When used in children, ADHD medications are not thought to have an addictive potential. They can, however, cause side-effects.",Possible side-effects of methylphenidate include:[6],"

Autism is a spectrum disorder, which means that people can experience a wide range of symptoms at a varying degree of severity.[2]",The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified that one child in 59 in the United States has an autism spectrum disorder. 1 to 2 percent of American children have received a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. Autism occurs in people of all ethnicities and is around four times more common in boys than in girls.[3],Symptoms of autism generally appear by the time a child is two years old. Autism cannot be cured but therapies and support services can help a person with autism improve symptoms.[2][4],Symptoms of autism,"Autism is a spectrum disorder, which means that the signs and symptoms vary from person to person. Some of the more common symptoms of autism include:[5]","
Not making eye contact
Delayed speech and communication skills
Relying on rules and routines
Becoming upset by changes to routines
A narrow or obsessive range of interests
Unexpected reactions to tastes, sounds, smells, sights and touch
Difficulty understanding other people’s emotions
Engaging in repetitive behavior such as flapping hands or rocking
","Symptoms of autism spectrum disorder are usually noticeable, and can be diagnosed by a medical professional by the time a child is two years old. Autism is diagnosed more frequently in males than females. In girls, symptoms of autism may be masked or missed, and the disorder is thought to be underdiagnosed.[6][7][8][9]",Read more about the signs of autism in children and adults.,Other conditions related to autism,Autism spectrum disorder is connected with various other conditions.,Learning disabilities and autism,Between 40 and 55 percent of people with autism spectrum disorder also have a learning disability. The impact of learning difficulties on a person can range from needing support in school to needing support in all aspects of their daily life.[10][11],Anxiety and autism,Anxiety and anxiety disorder are often found in people with autism spectrum disorder. Anxiety can be increased by changes to routine or confusing social situations. This anxiety can be expressed as:[12],"
General anxiety
Phobias
Obsessive compulsive disorder
Agoraphobia
",People with higher functioning levels of autism spectrum disorder seem more likely to have anxiety and anxiety disorders as well.,Gastrointestinal problems,"Up to 70 percent of people with autism spectrum disorder also have some form of gastrointestinal condition, such as diarrhea or gastritis. Many people with autism also develop intense preferences for certain foods.[13][14]","Where gastrointestinal problems cause pain and distress, this can cause the person to display frustrated and/or challenging behavior.","If a person with autism has chronic constipation, there could be a lack of fibre in their diet. There may be physical causes, such as problems in the gut or metabolism that should be referred to a medical professional if constipation continues.","Chronic diarrhea can be caused by food intolerances, such as to lactose or gluten, in which case it is generally treated by restricting the diet. Chronic diarrhea should be assessed by a medical professional. Other causes of diarrhea include:[15]","
Crohn’s disease
Irritable bowel syndrome
Infections
Medications
","Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) occurs when stomach contents, including stomach acid, leak into the esophagus. This causes irritation and the burning sensation known as heartburn. Symptoms can be eased with medication such as antacids, eating smaller meals or avoiding certain foods. A medical professional can discuss causes, prevention and treatment.[16]",ADHD and autism,"Autism spectrum disorder and ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) can be confused due to similar symptoms, such as:","
Inability to focus
Impulsivity
Hyperactivity
","Autism is a developmental disorder, whereas ADHD is a biological brain condition that is notable for a lack of attention and patterns of hyperactive and impulsive behavior.[17][18]",One study showed that 20 percent of children with autism are initially diagnosed with ADHD. This delay in making the appropriate diagnosis of autism also delays interventions such as behavioral therapy and skills training.[19],Pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS),Pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) is a condition now considered part of autism spectrum disorder by the DSM-5 [20]. Symptoms of PDD-NOS have significant overlap with ADHD.,"PDD-NOS can be given as a diagnosis for a developmental disorder that does not also meet the criteria for a named developmental disorder, such as autism, Asperger syndrome or Rett syndrome. PDD-NOS is likely to be the diagnosis where a person has:[21]","
Impairment in social interaction
Difficulties with communication

This may be caused by an underlying medical issue, such as gastrointestinal distress or sleep apnea, or poor sleep hygiene and bedtime routines.[22]",Epilepsy and autism,Around 20 to 38 percent of children with autism spectrum disorder will have developed epilepsy by the time they become adults. Children who develop epilepsy alongside autism are at a higher risk if they also have a learning disability. The link between epilepsy and autism is thought to come from shared underlying causes.[23][24][25],Read more about seizures.,Fragile X syndrome and autism,Fragile X syndrome is a genetic development disorder which causes learning disability. The extent of the learning disability can range from mild to severe. People with Fragile X syndrome have an increased risk of also developing autism.[26][27],Tuberous sclerosis complex and autism,"Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare genetic disorder that causes benign tumors to form in various organs, particularly the brain. Tumors in the brain can lead to seizures, developmental delays and learning difficulties. One study found that approximately 1 percent of children with autism also have tuberous sclerosis complex.[28][29]",Asperger syndrome,People with Asperger syndrome are generally considered to be on the higher functioning end of the autism spectrum. It is a type of autism and is a lifelong condition.,"Someone with Asperger syndrome may not be diagnosed until later in childhood or adulthood, as people with the condition often have excellent language skills. Signs that someone has Asperger syndrome can include:[30][31]","

",Causes of autism,"It is unclear what causes autism, though scientists believe genetics and environment are involved.","Around 85 percent of people with autism spectrum disorder can be classed as idiopathic, meaning the cause is not known. The remaining 15 percent of people have secondary autism spectrum disorder, where a specific cause can be identified.[32]",Genetic causes of autism,"In up to 25 percent of people with autism spectrum disorder the condition is thought to have a genetic cause. Over 100 genes, many of which concern brain development, may be involved in causing autism.[33][34][35]","Good to know: Not everyone with the identified genetic mutations has autism, and not everyone with autism has genetic mutations.","Autism can run in families, although it is unclear why. The brother of a child with autism has a 7 percent chance of developing autism, with an additional 7 percent chance of developing less severe autism spectrum symptoms. The sister of a child with autism has a 1 to 2 percent chance of developing autism plus the additional chance of less severe autism spectrum symptoms.[32][33]","Other genetic disorders, such as ADNP syndrome, can cause autism.[36]",Medications taken during pregnancy,"Valproic acid is used to treat seizures, mania in people with bipolar disorder, and to prevent migraine headaches. Taking valproic acid during pregnancy increases the risk that the child will be born with serious birth defects and that the child will develop an autism spectrum disorder.[37][38]",Thalidomide is used to treat a type of cancer called multiple myeloma. It is well known that thalidomide carries a risk of severe birth defects when taken by a person who is pregnant. Thalidomide can also be transmitted to a fetus through semen. Contact with thalidomide before birth increases the risk a child will develop autism spectrum disorder.[39][40],"Misoprostol is used to prevent ulcers. It can also be used to induce labour and, in high enough doses, terminate pregnancy in its early stages. There is some evidence to suggest that misoprostol use in the first trimester of pregnancy could cause autism spectrum disorder.[41]",Rubella,"When a pregnant person is exposed to rubella virus during the first trimester, the fetus has a high chance of developing congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). This condition can cause deafness, microcephaly, congenital heart disease and learning difficulties. Congenital rubella syndrome  is also associated with higher than usual incidences of autism spectrum disorder.[42][43]","CRS is very rare in the United States because of its policy for universal immunization against rubella. A study estimated that over 1,000 cases of autism spectrum disorder were prevented by rubella vaccination in the U.S. between 2001 and 2010.[44]",Older parents,"Children born to older parents are more likely to develop autism, the risk heightening with the parents’ age. The risk increases significantly for each additional 10 years in maternal and paternal age.[45][46]",Birth spacing,A study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found a connection between autism spectrum disorder and the amount of time between births for each mother. The study found that children who were conceived less than 18 months or more than 59 months (4 years and 11 months) after the previous birth were more likely to develop autism.[47],Autism and vaccines,"There has been extensive research on vaccines and autism, and all scientific evidence indicates there is no link between autism and vaccines.[48][49][50][51]",Diagnosis of autism,"In the DSM-5[20], autism spectrum disorder now covers conditions that used to be classified separately:[5]","

",Diagnosing autism in older children and teenagers,"Children with less severe forms of autism spectrum disorder may find their symptoms first becoming noticeable at school. For example, a child may find it difficult to form friendships or recognize social cues like sarcasm or jokes.[2]","Schools will communicate with parents or carers and may perform an initial evaluation, or recommend visiting a health professional.",Diagnosing autism in adults,"Some people do not receive a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder until adulthood. This can be due to complicating factors, such as the person being on the higher functioning end of the autism spectrum, having other disorders or being misdiagnosed. People with autism can be misdiagnosed with ADHD, obsessive compulsive disorder, depression or anxiety.[57][58]","If autism is suspected in an adult, a doctor should refer the person to a psychologist, psychiatrist or neuropsychologist who has experience with autism spectrum disorder. A diagnosis of autism may be reached after taking a history of the person’s life and interaction with others, as well as potentially talking to family members who may remember details of the person’s early development.[2]",A diagnosis of autism as an adult can provide the person with an explanation for previous difficulties and offer the opportunity for self-understanding and access to services.,Genetic testing,"Where there is a family history of autism spectrum disorder or physical evidence of another genetic disorder present, gene testing or chromosome analysis may be carried out.[32]",Increase in autism diagnoses,"More people are being diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. However, a variety of factors may be affecting the rate of this increase:","
More awareness of autism among caregivers leading to more referrals
Broader diagnostic criteria
Better awareness of diagnostic criteria among medical professionals
","There may also be a genuine increase in the number of individuals with autism. However, at present, it is unclear what is behind the statistics.[59]",Treatment of autism,"There is no standard treatment for autism spectrum disorder. However, there are therapies available which aim to minimize the symptoms of autism and allow the person to function as well as they can.","Intervention and treatment can improve external symptoms and how a person copes with sensory and perception differences. However, how someone processes sensory information such as sounds and smells will always be different to people without the condition.[60]","Although treatment, particularly behavioral therapy and skills training, is most effective when started young, any person at any age can benefit from appropriate treatment. Which treatments are appropriate will depend on the person, what they have difficulty with and the severity of their symptoms.[61]",Early intervention for autism,"In the U.S., early intervention services are available for children up to three years old with developmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder. These services focus on:[62][63]","

There are various types of therapy available. The most appropriate will depend on the needs and symptoms of the person with autism. A medical professional will be able to offer guidance on which are likely to provide most benefit.,"Many therapies involve the whole family, so that family members can learn how to support and help the person with autism. In young children, effective interventions should involve around 25 hours a week of active engagement.[22]",Therapies for autism spectrum disorder include:[22][61][62],"
Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT): Helps people recognize the connection between thoughts, feelings and behaviors
Behavioral management therapy: Uses various techniques to teach skills which improve social skills and reduce problematic behaviors
Occupational therapy: Helps with skills, such as getting dressed or skills needed for employment
Social skills training: Can help children cope with conversations and other social interactions
",Speech therapy for autism,"Many people with autism spectrum disorder experience delays in learning to talk, with up to 50 percent being nonverbal. Being able to communicate by speech by the time a child goes to school has been linked to more positive outcomes as the child grows into adulthood. Early intervention is, therefore, important.[64]","Speech-language therapy can help a person with autism express needs, desires and feelings. It can also improve a person’s vocabulary and speed of speech.[65]",Managing challenging behaviors,"If a person with autism spectrum disorder displays challenging behaviors, there are various courses of potential action to take:[66][67]","
Have the person tested to check for medical problems that could be causing distress
Behavioral therapy
Reward positive behavior
Communicate simply, to minimize frustration
Reduce sensory overload
Offer cues to redirect behavior such as verbal or gentle physical instruction
Provide relaxation opportunities
Be consistent and encourage others do the same
","Some challenging behaviors can be mitigated by allowing the behavior, but changing an element to make it more socially acceptable. If a person smears feces because they enjoy the sensation, replace the feces with a substance such as Play-Doh or cornflour mixed with water. With pica, inappropriate items can be replaced with something edible and nutritious.[68][69]",Managing repetitive behavior in autism,"Repetitive behaviors such as hand flapping or rocking may help a person with autism spectrum disorder. However, some repetitive behaviors, such as head banging, could cause the person harm. Other behaviors may cause distractions, such as in school or can be problematic if engaged in often to block out external sensory input.",Ways to manage unhelpful repetitive behavior include:[70][71],"
Behavioral therapy
Replacing harmful activities with safer activities
Change the environment to reduce distressing sensory input
Introduce other forms of stimulation, such as calming activities
",Using visual cues to manage autism,"People with autism are often highly reliant on routine. A visual timetable that shows what is going to happen during an activity, outing or a day can provide reassurance and prevent stress.","Pictograms and simple instructional diagrams in soft colors can provide information to people with autism spectrum disorder. Such signs can indicate what room a person is in, or how to operate an appliance or window.[72]","Visual supports can also provide a way to communicate for people with autism who are nonverbal. Cards of various colors or with simple pictograms can indicate a need, desire or mood.[73]",Toys for autism,"People with autism spectrum disorder process sensory information, such as touch, sight, taste, sound and smell, differently from people without the condition.

",Autism FAQs,"Q: How do I know if my kid has autism?
A: There are many different signs that a child might have autism. It is a spectrum disorder, meaning that the symptoms differ from one person to another and vary in severity. There are some common signs, such as avoiding eye contact, finding social interactions difficult, being reliant on routines and getting upset at minor changes or certain smells, tastes, sounds or lights. Parents are often the first people to notice symptoms, but a diagnosis can only be made by a team of experienced specialists.","Q: Are autism rates going up?
A: The number of people being diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder is increasing. However, it is unclear whether this is because there are more people with autism or whether parents, caregivers, schools and doctors are more aware of autism symptoms. This can lead to more people with autism being diagnosed, whereas, in the past, they might not have received a diagnosis.","Q: Are autism and ADHD related?
A: Autism and ADHD share some symptoms. Some people with autism are misdiagnosed with ADHD before receiving the correct diagnosis. Autism and ADHD are different conditions, though people with both can display fidgety behavior, struggle with social skills, react unusually to sensory input and experience outbursts due to frustration. See the section on ADHD and autism.","Q: Are autism and Asperger syndrome the same?
A: Asperger syndrome is a condition that is classified as an autism spectrum disorder. Autism is a spectrum disorder, meaning that people can have autism but show different symptoms of differing severity. People with Asperger syndrome are generally towards the higher functioning end of the autism spectrum. See the section on Asperger syndrome.","Q: Can autism be cured?
A: There is no cure for autism. It is a lifelong condition. However, with appropriate intervention a person with autism spectrum disorder can learn to manage their behaviors and emotions, and have a better quality of day-to-day life. See the section on treatment.","Q: What diet should someone with autism and gastrointestinal problems have?
A: It is common for people with autism to experience gastrointestinal problems. Discomfort can cause distress and difficult behavior, prompted by the underlying gastrointestinal medical condition. A doctor should be consulted to find the underlying cause. (See the section on Gastrointestinal problems.) No particular diet has been shown to affect symptoms of autism itself.",Other names for autism,"Autism spectrum disorder

first occurs in children before the age of five. Also known as atopic eczema, infantile atopic dermatitis or just atopic
dermatitis, the condition results in red, dry, itchy and cracked skin that may sometimes
crack and bleed.[1] Eczema can affect the whole body, though the hands, face and neck are
the most commonly affected areas in babies.","Baby eczema will generally disappear before the child reaches their teens, but in some cases
can continue into teenage and adulthood. The condition can be treated with a variety of creams,
ointments and minor environmental changes.",Symptoms of baby eczema,"Eczema in babies appears as dry, red, scaly, itchy and flaky skin. In young babies, the scalp,
face, ears and neck are the most commonly affected areas. In older babies, the arms and legs
may be more commonly affected, especially around the elbows and knees, as well as the diaper
area. [2] In severe cases, baby eczema can cause painful cracking of the skin, with oozing
and bleeding. As children get older, the skin that is affected by the condition normally
becomes less red but scalier, leatherier and thicker – this is known as lichenification and
may also occur as a result of persistent scratching.[3]","If your baby is experiencing possible symptoms of baby eczema, carry out a symptom assessment with the free Ada app now.",Causes and triggers of baby eczema,"The causes of baby eczema are unclear, though it is generally agreed that the condition
stems from a mixture of genetic and environmental factors.[4] Knowing what triggers baby
eczema can be useful in keeping the condition under control. Common triggers include:","
Dry skin: When the skin becomes too dry it becomes susceptible to rashes and flare-ups of eczema.
Moisture on the skin: From sweat, milk, saliva or wet diapers.
Chemical irritants: Natural or artificial chemicals found in everyday products can
make an outbreak of eczema more likely. These chemicals can be found in products such as
shampoo, soap, laundry detergent and disinfectants or surface cleaners.
Dust mites: Some research shows that prolonged exposure to dust mites increases the
likelihood of an infant developing eczema. Further research in the area suggests that
reducing the number of dust mites in the home makes little difference to the frequency
and severity of eczema flares after the first diagnosis.[5]
Stress: Babies can become extremely irritated by eczema which can in turn exacerbate
the condition further.
",Diagnosing baby eczema,"Diagnosing eczema in babies is relatively easy due to the visibility and characteristic
appearance of the condition. A doctor will examine the baby and judge whether the symptoms
are a result of eczema (atopic dermatitis or contact dermatitis, which results from exposure
to allergens or irritants and can usually be treated quickly.",Baby eczema treatment,"As soon as the presence of baby eczema becomes apparent, treatment options should be explored
quickly to avoid the condition spreading or becoming more severe. Understanding and avoiding
the potential causes and triggers of baby eczema is key to managing the condition, but a
variety of further options are also available.[6] In particularly severe cases, a consultation
with a specialist dermatologist may be necessary.",Moisturizing ointments and creams,"Using a moisturizing ointment or cream to keep the skin soft and moist is key to tackling
baby eczema.[7] Moisturizers are classified according to their oil and water content, with
the most effective moisturizers containing a higher amount of oil.","Ointments and barrier creams should be applied to the skin in a thick layer at least twice
per day and immediately after bathing. They can be bought over the counter at the pharmacy
or be prescribed by a doctor.",Topical Steroids,"Mild topical steroids (steroids applied to the skin) can be used to reduce the redness and
soreness of baby eczema flare-ups.[8] These steroids are perfectly safe when applied correctly
and under the guidance of a healthcare professional. They are, however, generally intended
for short-term use, unless otherwise advised by a doctor.",Soaps,"Unscented, additive-free and dye-free cleansers only should be used on babies experiencing
eczema. A range of such products are available and should be used in conjunction with
moisturizing ointments or topical steroids. It is generally advised that a doctor’s opinion
should be sought before using these products.",Bathing,"An appropriate bathing routine is critical to treating baby eczema. Baths are recommended
over showers and should be warm rather than hot and last no longer than 10 minutes. They
should also be followed by the application of prescribed topical lotions and ointments.",Baby eczema FAQs,"Q: Will my child grow out of eczema?
A: In most cases, yes. Eczema generally develops in children from the age of two
months-old and peters out by around three years-old. However, some children can experience
eczema into the teenage years and even into adulthood.[9]","Q: Are there any home remedies that can be used to treat baby eczema?
A: There are a number of home remedies that can be used to treat some of the symptoms
of baby eczema. However, it is generally a good idea to seek a doctor’s opinion and follow
the treatment path outlined. Bathing in water mixed with oatmeal, using a humidifier and
the application of coconut oil are among the most common home remedies.[10]","Q: What does the term “atopic” mean?
A: Atopic (as in atopic eczema or atopic dermatitis) refers to a predisposition toward developing certain allergic hypersensitivity reactions such as eczema, asthma or hay fever.[1] Atopic eczema in babies and atopic dermatitis in babies are simply synonyms of baby eczema.","Q: What is dermatitis?
A: Dermatitis is an umbrella term for a group of conditions that cause inflammation of the skin. Although the different types of dermatitis have differing causes, most involve the onset of red, itchy and dry skin or a rash. Baby eczema, or atopic dermatitis, is one form of dermatitis. Others include contact dermatitis (caused by the skin coming into contact with irritants) and seborrheic dermatitis (which can cause a flare-up of red skin, scaly patches and dandruff).[11]","Q: What is the relationship between food allergies and baby eczema?
A: Food allergies are common in infants with eczema. However, they are separate conditions and it is not accurate to say that food allergies cause eczema. Instead, it appears that having eczema may increase the chances of an infant developing allergies to certain foods. A flare-up of both conditions may cause a rash or red, itchy skin, however, eczema is typically focussed on specific parts of the body (hands, face, neck) while an allergic reaction is more unpredictable.[12]"
,,,,,,,,,,What is bacterial conjunctivitis?
,,,,,,,,,,What is bacterial conjunctivitis?,"Conjunctivitis is the name for inflammation of the conjunctiva; this is the thin layer of tissue on the inside of the eyelids and covers the white part of the eye. Also known as pink eye, conjunctivitis is often caused by bacteria, a virus or allergies. If pink eye is caused by bacteria, it is called bacterial conjunctivitis. Like all types of pink eye, bacterial conjunctivitis is common but not usually serious.[1][2][3][4][5]",One or both eyes can be affected. The main symptoms of bacterial conjunctivitis include:[1][2][3][4],"
Pinkness or redness of the eye
Burning, itching, a sensation of grittiness, or mild pain or discomfort in the eye
Thick, sticky discharge from the eye
Swollen and/or reddened eyelids
","Many cases of mild bacterial conjunctivitis clear up on their own, within a week or two and without any specific treatment. Cleaning the eyes throughout the day with water and a clean cloth or sterile pad, and using lubricating eye drops, also known as artificial tears, may help to relieve symptoms. However, antibiotic eye drops or ointments may be recommended, particularly for more severe cases of bacterial conjunctivitis.[1][2][3][4]","Generally, people make a complete recovery, and the condition does not cause any complications. However, if bacterial conjunctivitis occurs in newborn babies or people with weakened immune systems, such as those who have HIV or are undergoing treatment for cancer, it can be very serious, and medical advice should be sought without delay.[1][6]","In addition, anyone experiencing severe symptoms should see a doctor immediately. These include:[4][6]","
Intense pain in the eye
Extreme redness in the eye
Inability to open the eye
Severe sensitivity to light
Blurred vision that persists after wiping away discharge
","Furthermore, if symptoms are mild but do not go away, medical advice should also be sought.","Bacterial conjunctivitis can affect people of any age, but it is more common in children than adults.[4] It is very contagious, which means that it can be spread easily from person to person. For this reason, it is important for people who have bacterial conjunctivitis to take steps to avoid passing it on to others, such as practising good hygiene.",Symptoms of bacterial conjunctivitis,Bacterial conjunctivitis often begins in one eye and then spreads to the other. Symptoms may include:[1][3][4][7],"
Pinkness or redness in the eye
Burning, itching, a sensation of grittiness, or mild pain or discomfort in the eye
Increased watering of the eye
Thick, sticky, often yellowish discharge from the eye; this can form a “crust” at night, making the eyes feel as if they are glued shut in the morning
Swollen eyelids
Slight sensitivity to bright light
Swelling of the lymph nodes in front of the ears
","Bacterial conjunctivitis usually only causes mild symptoms and does not affect a person’s vision, other than causing slight blurriness when discharge has built up on and around the eye.[4][7] Depending on the type of bacteria causing the infection, there may be additional symptoms.","If symptoms are severe or vision is impaired, it is important to contact a doctor without delay. It is also extremely important to see a doctor if any signs of bacterial conjunctivitis are present in a newborn baby.",Causes of bacterial conjunctivitis,The most common causes of bacterial conjunctivitis are the following types of bacteria:[7],"
Staphylococcus aureus
Staphylococcus epidermidis
Streptococcus pneumonia
Haemophilus influenzae; this is not the same as the flu, which is caused by a virus
","Less commonly, the infection can be the result of the following sexually transmitted infections (STIs):[4]","
Chlamydia
Gonorrhea
",Bacterial conjunctivitis caused by chlamydia or gonorrhea is more serious and requires treatment by a doctor.,Diagnosis of bacterial conjunctivitis,"When symptoms are mild, a diagnosis of bacterial conjunctivitis can often be made without seeing a doctor, and the condition can be treated at home. However, if there is any uncertainty or concern over the condition, or the symptoms are severe, seeing a doctor is very important.","A doctor will take the person’s medical history and ask whether anyone they know might have had an eye infection recently. They will examine the eyes and assess the signs and symptoms present, taking care to rule out acute viral conjunctivitis, allergic conjunctivitis and other more serious eye conditions, such as uveitis.[3][5][7]","In most cases, it will not be necessary to order laboratory tests to confirm the diagnosis. However, in cases that are severe or do not respond to treatment, as well as in the case of infants, the doctor may take a small swab from the eyelid and test it to determine the cause of the infection and ensure that the treatment approach is correct.[8][9][5]",Treatment for bacterial conjunctivitis,Mild cases of bacterial conjunctivitis often clear up within 1-2 weeks without special medical treatment.,The following home remedies and over-the-counter treatments may help to relieve the discomfort caused by conjunctivitis:[1][9][4][6][7],"
Gently cleaning discharge from the eye with a clean cloth, sterile pad or cotton wool soaked in water
Applying lubricating eye drops, called artificial tears, which are available without a prescription, to the eye; care must be taken not to use the drops in the other eye, if only one eye is infected
Applying a cold or warm compress, a clean cloth that has been soaked in water, to the eye
Avoiding the use of contact lenses until the infection has cleared
",Antibiotics for bacterial conjunctivitis,"Antibiotic eye drops or eye ointment may help to clear up the infection more quickly. However, they are not always needed, and many cases of mild bacterial conjunctivitis will resolve on their own, without antibiotic treatment.[7]","Topical antibiotics are typically recommended for more severe or persistent cases of bacterial conjunctivitis, with eye drops usually preferred over ointments for ease of use.[4][7]","Less commonly, where the cause of bacterial conjunctivitis is chlamydia or gonorrhea, a course of oral or injected antibiotics may be necessary.[7]",Complications of bacterial conjunctivitis,"Most cases of mild bacterial conjunctivitis clear up completely, without causing any complications. However, in a small number of severe cases, the infection can cause serious complications, including:[7]","
Ulcers on the cornea of the eye
Damage to vision
Otitis media, an ear infection
","If a person experiences any severe symptoms, or is concerned about an eye infection, it is recommended that they see a doctor without delay.",Bacterial conjunctivitis in newborns,"Infants can be affected by various types of conjunctivitis, including bacterial conjunctivitis. Pink eye in newborns is called neonatal conjunctivitis or ophthalmia neonatorum.

It is treated with antibiotics and may require referral to a specialist.[3][4],"Conjunctivitis in babies is sometimes mistaken for sticky eyes caused by a blocked tear duct. However, a blocked tear duct will not cause redness or swelling.[4]",Prevention of bacterial conjunctivitis,"While it may not always be possible to prevent bacterial conjunctivitis, taking the following steps can help to reduce the likelihood of an infection:[10][1]","
Avoiding contact with people who have pink eye
Maintaining good hygiene, such as washing your hands often with soap and water, or using hand sanitizer
Avoiding touching your eyes when your hands are not clean
","If you have bacterial conjunctivitis, the following actions can help avoid spreading the infection to others:[10][1][8]","
Maintaining good hygiene, such as washing your hands often with soap and water, or using hand sanitizer, especially after treating the eyes
Cleaning your spectacles
Avoiding touching the eyes other than when treating them, as this can spread the bacteria
Washing pillowcases and towels often and avoiding sharing them with others
Avoiding sharing makeup and eye drops
When necessary, staying off school or work until symptoms of bacterial conjunctivitis have cleared; this is generally when the eyes are no longer red and irritated
Avoiding the use of swimming pools
","In addition, contact lenses should not be worn until symptoms have cleared, and a new pair used when the infection has gone away. Some makeup may also need to be discarded and replaced to prevent reinfection.[10][1]",Bacterial conjunctivitis FAQs,"Q: Viral vs. bacterial conjunctivitis – what is the difference?
A: While both types of conjunctivitis are highly contagious, the causes, some of the symptoms and the treatments are different. Viral conjunctivitis is caused by a virus, often from the group of viruses that cause the common cold, results in a watery discharge from the eye, and has no specific treatment. Bacterial conjunctivitis is caused by bacteria, often types of staphylococcus or streptococcus, is spread through poor hygiene or contact with other people or insects, results in a thick, sticky discharge from the eye, and may – in some cases – require antibiotic eye drops.[8][9][2][11]","Q: My child has bacterial conjunctivitis. Is it necessary to keep them home from school?
A: It depends on the region and institution. Some experts feel that a child should not be required to stay at home with bacterial conjunctivitis, unless an outbreak of multiple cases has occurred. However, a particular daycare center or school may have their own policy and ask that a child with bacterial conjunctivitis be kept at home until their symptoms have cleared up, to reduce the likelihood of infecting other children.[4]",Other names for bacterial conjunctivitis,"

The meninges are filled with a fluid called cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF. Usually, the blood and brain systems are seperate. Healthy CSF is sterile,[6] meaning it is free from bacteria or other microorganisms.","The bacteria that infect the meninges in bacterial meningitis can come from anywhere in the body,[1] and once they are in the CSF, they multiply, releasing toxins. This causes inflammation of the meninges and the brain, which increases intracranial pressure (ICP), i.e. pressure inside the skull. This increase in pressure causes many of the distinctive symptoms of meningitis,[7] including a stiff neck, headache and sensitivity to light.","Because of the blood-brain barrier, the body’s immune system battles to fight the infection, which causes great stress on the body. White blood cells and other elements of the immune system enter the CSF. The flow of blood components into the CSF means that the amount of blood flowing in the body is reduced, which affects the amount of oxygen available to the muscles and organs. The body tries to maintain its oxygen supply to the vital organs by reducing blood flow to the extremities, resulting in cold hands and feet.[7]","The spread of blood components into the CSF, along with the bacterial infection, can cause the brain to swell, a condition known as cerebral edema. Intracranial pressure increases, causing complications and, in some cases, death.[1]",Bacterial meningitis can result in complications that affect cognitive functioning if not treated in time and is often fatal if not treated.

An infection elsewhere in the body, such as otitis media, mastoiditis, bacterial sinusitis, bacterial endocarditis, or pneumonia
Recent cranial surgery
Cranial shunts or stents
Head injuries that penetrate the scalp, meningeal membranes, and/or skull
Crowding, for example in a military barracks or student dormitory
Exposure to someone with bacterial meningitis
",Various bacteria can cause meningitis. The ones most often encountered include:[1],"
Haemophilus influenzae
Staphylococcus aureus or Staphylococcus epidermidis
Pneumococcus, also known as Streptococcus pneumoniae
Meningococcus, also known as Neisseria meningitidis
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, although this is rare
",Other bacteria which can cause meningitis include:[1],"
Escherichia coli
Klebsiella
Pseudomonas aeruginosa
Salmonella
Listeria monocytogenes (see FAQs)
",Meningococcal meningitis,"Meningococcal meningitis is caused by a bacteria known as Neisseria meningitidis. Rates of meningococcal meningitis are dropping in the developed world, largely due to the availability of a vaccine against Meningococcus C.[4] Meningococcal infection can cause septicemia or meningitis, or both (see FAQs).","Many people carry meningococcal bacteria in their nose and throat, where they are quite harmless. These bacteria have to breach the immune system in order to cause an infection, and they tend to cause only isolated cases or small outbreaks.[2] These bacteria can be passed on by contact such as kissing, sneezing or coughing.","However, meningococcus is endemic to certain developing countries in Asia and Africa. It is a common cause of meningitis associated with overseas travel. Muslim pilgrims on the Hajj are particularly at risk.[3] Travellers to these regions should ask their physicians about the possibility of getting the meningococcus C vaccine; vaccinations against meningococcus A, W135 and Y may also be useful.",Pneumococcal meningitis,"Severe pneumococcal infections are more common in developing countries.[4] Like meningococcus, pneumococcus can cause meningitis and septicemia,[7] but many people carry it harmlessly in their noses and throats, and infections can only happen if the bacteria breach the immune system.[2]","Meningitis caused by pneumococcus can be more severe than that caused by meningococcus, and is associated with somewhat higher mortality.[3] However, vaccines against pneumococcal meningitis are available. Worried that your or someone you know may have bacterial meningitis? You can do a free symptom assessment with Ada at any time.",Diagnosing bacterial meningitis,"Diagnosis is based on the symptoms, the physical examination and tests which confirm the presence of a severe infection in the body. A sample of cerebrospinal fluid, the fluid in the meninges around the brain and spinal cord is taken and tested for the specific bacteria causing the infection. When bacterial meningitis is suspected, antibiotic therapy should be started right away.[1]",Lumbar puncture,"Also known as a spinal tap, a lumbar puncture is a crucial part of the diagnostic process for bacterial meningitis. A lumbar puncture is done to obtain a sample of cerebrospinal fluid, which is then sent for laboratory testing. Lumbar punctures are usually quite safe, though may be a little tender or painful afterwards.","A lumbar puncture is done under local anesthetic, and a needle is inserted into a gap between two lumbar vertebrae in the lower back. A needle is used to draw off a small amount of fluid from around the spinal cord. The spinal cord itself is not touched.","Good to know: Some affected people, especially those who have already had a seizure, are at increased risk of high intracranial pressure. Performing a lumbar puncture on someone with highly elevated intracranial pressure increases the risk of brain herniation (see FAQs). These people will require a CT scan of the head first. The attending physicians will determine who may need a CT scan.",Blood and CSF tests,"The CSF sample taken during the lumbar puncture will be analysed to confirm the presence of bacteria, determine what kind of bacteria are causing the infection, and determine how far along the infection is.",Blood tests may also be carried out to check organ function and dehydration. These results will guide the treatment.,Treating bacterial meningitis,"Bacterial meningitis is a serious condition and requires urgent medical care. The infection is treated with intravenous (IV) antibiotics, i.e. through a drip. People with bacterial meningitis are often very sick and may need other supportive treatment, such as fluids to increase blood pressure while the antibiotics work to fight the infection. Most people with suspected bacterial meningitis will also be isolated after being admitted to hospital.",Antibiotic treatment of bacterial meningitis,"Most cases of bacterial meningitis are treated with intravenous antibiotics administered as soon as possible. Because the treatment often begins before the exact bacteria responsible is identified, the antibiotics used may change. Also, as some of the bacteria that cause bacterial meningitis are becoming drug-resistant, several antibiotics may have to be tried before treatment is successful. Antibiotics commonly used to treat bacterial meningitis include:[1][3]","
Cefotaxime
Vancomycin
Ampicillin
Ceftriaxone
Penicillin
Benzylpenicillin
","Good to know, although it is not an antibiotic, dexamethasone may be used in infants.",Supportive treatment for bacterial meningitis,"People with meningitis will be treated as inpatients in hospital, and most will need to be in intensive care for a short time. They will be monitored for seizures, dehydration,[2] coughing or straining (which can increase intracranial pressure), pain, fever and hypotension (low blood pressure).[1] There is some evidence  that administering corticosteroids reduces inflammation, which decreases the risk of some complications.[3]",Complications of bacterial meningitis,"Because meningitis involves a severe infection of the brain and the spinal cord, and also affects the body as a whole, complications are common. Even with prompt treatment, almost three in ten survivors of meningitis have neurological complications of some kind, with one in seven experiencing serious long-term problems.[1]",Short-term complications,The severity of the bacterial infection in meningitis can cause short-term complications such as:[1],"
Septic shock (sepsis)
Coma
Seizures
Cerebral edema
Pericardial effusion
Hemolytic anemia
Septic arthritis
Peripheral gangrene
Waterhouse-Friderichsen Syndrome
",Waterhouse-Friderichsen Syndrome,"Severe bacterial infections, such as bacterial meningitis, can cause a rare complication called Waterhouse-Friderichsen Syndrome, a condition in which the adrenal glands fail due to bleeding. The syndrome causes bleeding throughout the body and, because of the damage to the adrenal glands, adrenal insufficiency. Symptoms include:[8][9]","
A rash, which begins as small, pink patches or pimple-like swellings, which expand into larger, purple patches

",Good to know: Low blood pressure and fast heart rate are signs of shock. People showing these symptoms should receive prompt medical attention.,"Most cases are caused by severe infection with meningococcal bacteria, Group B streptococcus, Streptococcus aeruginosa, Staphylococcus pneumoniae or Staphylococcus aureus.","Waterhouse-Friderichsen Syndrome is a medical emergency and anyone who shows symptoms of the syndrome should receive medical care immediately. Treatment is usually carried out in an intensive care unit (ICU), and is supportive while using antibiotics and glucocorticoids. However, due to the severity of the syndrome, affected people may die of sepsis.[8]",Long-term complications,"In the long term, some people who have had meningitis, experience some degree of:[2][4]","

",FAQs,"Q: How is bacterial meningitis related to septicemia?
A: Some cases of bacterial meningitis are caused by a bacteria called Neisseiria meningitidis, which is also known as meningococcus. Meningococcus can also cause meningococcal septicemia, a blood infection that can be very serious,[10] especially for young children and babies.[11] Meningococcal meningitis and meningococcal septicemia are both types of meningococcal disease; meningococcal septicemia is also sometimes called meningococcemia.[12] Meningitis and septicemia are both medical emergencies, and if you suspect that you or a loved one has meningitis or septicemia, you should seek medical care as soon as possible.","Q: What are the symptoms of septicaemia?
A: The symptoms of meningococcal septicemia, like the symptoms of meningitis, can come on suddenly, and the affected person can become very ill within hours.[10] The symptoms of meningococcal septicemia include:[12][4]","
Fever
Fatigue
Cold hands and feet
Pale, mottled or blue skin
Rapid heartbeat
Chills
Vomiting and nausea, sometimes with diarrhea
Abdominal pain, muscle pain, joint pain and/or chest pain
Low urine output
Thirstiness
Rapid breathing, labored breathing or grunting while breathing
Low blood pressure
A purple rash on the skin that does not fade when pressed
","Not all affected people will have all of these symptoms. If the rash is present, or if the affected person has lowered blood pressure, the infection is serious and an ambulance should be called. All cases of septicemia will require urgent medical care, and it is essential that medical care is sought as soon as possible. The chances of a good outcome are improved if the disease is spotted early. Parents of small children or the caregivers of people who are at risk of septicemia should be on the lookout for:[4][5]","
Fever
Vomiting and nausea
Lethargy
Pain in the legs
Cold hands and/or feet
Pale, mottled or bluish skin
","These are the earliest symptoms; others may appear as the infection continues. It is possible to have meningococcal septicemia and meningococcal meningitis at the same time. For the symptoms of meningococcal septicemia, see above. If you are concerned that you or a loved one may have meningococcal meningitis or septicemia, start a free Ada symptom assessment now.","Q: What is the difference between viral and bacterial meningitis?
A: Viral meningitis is also known as aseptic meningitis. Viral meningitis is a serious medical problem in itself, and anyone who might have it should seek medical help as soon as they can, but it is usually less serious than bacterial meningitis. It is much more common than bacterial meningitis.","Most cases of viral meningitis in people with healthy immune systems clear up on their own within a week or so, and complications are not common. However, everyone who presents with the symptoms of meningitis should seek urgent medical care, as it is not possible to tell whether meningitis is caused by bacteria or viruses just by looking at the symptoms.","Viruses that can cause aseptic meningitis include the flu virus, the common cold virus, the measles virus, and HIV, the mumps virus, as well as enteroviruses such as the polio virus.[13]","Q: What is the treatment for viral meningitis?
A: Some people with severe viral meningitis may need to be hospitalized for a short period, but generally the treatment is aimed at relieving the symptoms. It is important to stay well-hydrated, and the pain and fever can be managed with acetaminophen/paracetamol or, in adults, aspirin.[14] However, everyone who presents with the symptoms of meningitis should seek urgent medical care, as it is not possible to tell whether meningitis is caused by bacteria or viruses just by looking at the symptoms.[15]","Some kinds of viral meningitis can be prevented by vaccines which prevent the diseases that can lead to viral meningitis. Diseases associated with viral meningitis, which a person can be vaccinated against, include the chickenpox, measles, mumps and influenza vaccines.","Q: Can meningitis be caused by fungi, parasites or amebas?
A: Yes. Though rarer than viral or bacterial meningitis, fungi, parasites and amebas can all cause meningitis in some instances.","Fungal meningitis is rare in the developed world, but can be caused by Cryptococcus, Histoplasma, Blastomyces, or Coccidioides. Most of these fungal organisms are found in soil contaminated by bird or bat droppings. Candida, another fungus that can cause meningitis, is usually found in hospital settings. Fungal meningitis cannot be passed from person to person.[16]","Parasitic meningitis can be caused by parasitic nematodes (worms) and roundworms.[17] Most cases are found in people who have travelled to Southeast Asia and eaten contaminated meat or fish, seafood, eggs, snails or fresh produce washed in contaminated water. However, a roundworm called Baylisascaris procyonis is found in raccoon droppings in North America.[18] Parasitic meningitis is quite rare.","Amebic meningitis is very rare, but very serious. It is caused by a water-dwelling ameba called Naegleria fowleri, which is found in unchlorinated water, i.e. warm freshwater bodies such as lakes and swimming holes, bodies of water contaminated by warm industrial discharges, poorly-maintained swimming pools, untreated drinking water, or dirty water heaters. The organism requires warm conditions to survive, and cannot survive in saltwater.[19]","Q: Does Haemophilus influenzae cause the flu?
A: No. Despite the name, viruses that cause influenza are not related to Haemophilus influenzae, which is a bacterium.[20] Influenza is a viral disease caused by a type of orthomyxovirus. Haemophilus influenzae was named by its discoverer during an influenza epidemic in the late 1800s; at that time, it was not known that viruses caused influenza, and the disease was thought to be caused by bacteria.","Q: Who is at risk from Listeria monocytogenes infection?
A: Listeria monocytogenes is a bacterium that is often found as a food contaminant, and most cases of infection, also known as listeriosis, are the result of consuming contaminated food. It does not often cause meningitis, but as listeria-related meningitis has a high mortality, it is important to be vigilant about outbreaks of listeria. People at increased risk of developing meningitis after a listeria infection include:","
Pregnant women
Infants and young children
People over 60 years of age
Alcoholics
Immunosuppressed individuals
People with diabetes
People with chronic kidney or liver disease.
","Q: What is a brain herniation?
A: A brain herniation occurs when high pressure or a change in pressure causes the brain, blood vessels within the brain, or cerebrospinal fluid to move out of their usual position.[21] The brain tissue may be pressed out through an injury in the skull or one of the skull’s natural internal openings, for example the foramen magnum, the hole in the base of the skull through which the spinal cord passes from the brain into the spine. Brain herniation is a serious medical condition, and treatment is essential. Neurological damage or death may result from a brain herniation.","Q: How is the risk of brain herniation minimized during the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis?
A: The most common method of keeping the risk of brain herniation to a minimum is to give the affected person at CT scan before the lumbar puncture is carried out. CT scans are not generally considered to be a standard requirement in the diagnosis of meningitis, but they are an important precaution to prevent brain herniation following a lumbar puncture. People who have the following conditions may need to have a CT scan before a lumbar puncture can be carried out:[1][3]","
A history of stroke or other central nervous system problems
Seizures within the previous seven days
Altered or reduced consciousness
A very severe headache
A possible neurological deficit, such as nonreactive pupils or gaze palsy, a condition that affects the ability of the eyes to move in the same direction simultaneously.

The prostate is a gland that sits under the bladder, and forms the first part of the urethra (the tube that carries urine away from the bladder). Older men with an enlarged prostate are commonly affected by bacterial prostatitis. Typical symptoms are fever, chills, burning sensation while urinating, difficulty to start urination, and pain around the anus. Treatment includes antibiotics, pain killers and, sometimes, a urinary catheter if emptying the bladder becomes difficult. With antibiotic treatment, many people recover well.",Risks,"The prostate is a gland that sits under the bladder, and forms the first part of the urethra (the tube that carries urine away from the bladder). Bacterial infections can form in the prostate due to bladder infections or some sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Older men who already have an enlarged prostate gland are most commonly affected but men of every age can get bacterial prostatitis. Men who have diabetes, a weak immune system, an indwelling urinary catheter, or who self-catheterize (use a tube to empty the bladder of urine) are at higher risk of developing bacterial prostatitis.",Symptoms,"Common symptoms of bacterial prostatitis are fever, chills, a burning sensation while urinating, difficulty to start urination, and pain around the anus. Other symptoms are foul-smelling urine, weak urine flow, painful ejaculation and blood in the urine.",Diagnosis,"The diagnosis is made based on the symptoms, examination of the prostate, and urine tests. Examination of the prostate involves a doctor gently putting a finger into the anus and feeling the prostate through the rectum (from behind the prostate). This can be a little painful for people with prostatitis. The urine is tested for bacteria, and this is sometimes requires prostatic massage, a procedure in which a doctor massages the prostate before the urine sample is made.",Treatment,"Bacterial prostatitis is treated with antibiotics. These are usually taken for 2-4 weeks. If the infection becomes persistent, longer courses of antibiotics or antibiotics through a drip (intravenous) may be needed.

,,,,,,,,,,What is bacterial sinusitis?
,,,,,,,,,,What is bacterial sinusitis?,"Bacterial sinusitis is a bacterial infection of the paranasal sinuses, the hollow spaces in the bones of the face around the nose. Sinusitis is a very common problem, affecting approximately one in every eight American adults annually. Almost 30 million people seek medical help for sinusitis in the USA every year.[1]","Bacterial sinusitis involves inflammation of the mucous membrane lining of the sinuses, and is caused by a bacterial infection. There are four pairs of paranasal sinuses which are located below, above, between and behind the eye sockets – the maxillary sinuses, frontal sinuses, ethmoid sinuses and sphenoidal sinuses. The maxillary sinuses are the largest of these, and are most often affected by sinusitis. However, sinusitis can affect any or all of the paranasal sinuses. Because sinusitis often occurs along with rhinitis, inflammation of the mucous membrane in the nose, it is sometimes known as rhinosinusitis.[2]","Bacterial sinusitis often follows a viral infection, such as a cold or the flu. Viral infections can cause the mucosal lining of the sinuses to swell.[3] In healthy sinuses, mucus drains into the nasal cavity via small holes, known as ostia. Swelling of the mucus membranes in the nose or sinus cavities can block these holes, preventing mucus from draining out of the sinuses. Bacteria colonize the undrained mucous, which can lead to bacterial sinusitis.[2]","Bacterial sinusitis may be treated with anti-inflammatory medications, and antibiotics as needed. Most cases of bacterial sinusitis resolve within two weeks, and have no further symptoms.",Signs and symptoms of bacterial sinusitis,Viral sinusitis and bacterial sinusitis,"Viral sinusitis is the most common type of sinusitis. It is usually caused by the same viruses that cause the common cold, and typically lasts for between seven and ten days.[4] If the condition lasts longer than 10 days, or there is a worsening of symptoms after 5-7 days, the sinusitis is more likely caused by bacteria than a virus.[3]","Acute, subacute and chronic bacterial sinusitis",Bacterial sinusitis can be grouped into the following subtypes based on the duration of symptoms:[2][4][5],"
Acute, which lasts for less than four weeks
Subacute, lasting for between four and 12 weeks
Chronic, lasting for more than 12 weeks
Recurrent acute, occurring four or more times a year, for more than seven days, with symptoms resolving completely in between bouts
",Symptoms of  bacterial sinusitis,Symptoms of  bacterial sinusitis include:[1][2][4][6],"

In severe cases or cases that do not respond to treatment, a nasal endoscopy may be done to aid diagnosis and treatment.",Endoscopic diagnosis,"An endoscope is a small, flexible tool equipped with a camera, which allows the doctor a detailed view of the inside of the nose and sinuses. The endoscopic examination is usually done in the doctor’s office. A nasal decongestant will be administered, and the nose will be numbed by an anesthetic spray. If the endoscopic exam is not helpful or if the doctor wants to carry out further examination, a computed tomography (CT) scan may be ordered. A CT scan can be helpful in assessing the sinuses and confirming the diagnosis in complicated cases.",Treatment,"Most cases of bacterial sinusitis will get better without antibiotics, usually within 14 days.[4] Because of this, and because bacterial sinusitis is often caused by bacteria that are to some degree resistant to antibiotics, most doctors prefer that affected people initially try to manage the condition using home remedies and over the counter medications. Antibiotics are usually only prescribed for people who have severe or ongoing symptoms, or whose infection may be complicated by various other medical factors. Viral sinusitis does not respond to antibiotic treatment.","Although most cases of bacterial sinusitis clear up without the help of  a doctor, affected people should seek medical assistance if:[2]","
They have a fever of 101.5F or 38C or higher
They have a bad headache that is not relieved by basic painkillers such as paracetamol

They have had symptoms for more than 10 days
Their symptoms are worsening
They have had antibiotic treatment but the symptoms persist
",Home remedies for bacterial sinusitis,"In many cases, home remedies may be sufficient. Some people find breathing humid air or steam, such as in a warm shower, helps to relieve symptoms. Also, holding a warm pad over the painful area helps to relieve discomfort. Nasal irrigation with saline solution is helpful in reducing congestion in the nose. It is also very important to stay well-hydrated, so affected people should be sure to drink enough fluids.",Over-the-counter remedies,"Analgesic and anti-inflammatory medications, such as ibuprofen or paracetamol, may help to reduce pain and swelling in the nose and face. Decongestant sprays or tablets are also often helpful in relieving symptoms. Decongestants commonly used are pseudoephedrine and phenylephrine, or corticosteroids such as fluticasone.","Good to know: If over-the-counter decongestant nasal sprays or drops are being used, they should not be used for more than three days in a row as they may cause rebound congestion if used for longer. These products do not shorten the duration of bacterial sinusitis but may relieve symptoms.[6] Antihistamines are not recommended as treatment for bacterial sinusitis as they increase nasal dryness and discomfort by making mucus thicker and harder to drain.[5]",Antibiotic treatment for bacterial sinusitis,"Antibiotic treatment is usually only needed if the infection does not improve within 7-10 days, the person has another medical condition which may affect recovery, or if:[5][6]","
Severe pain is present
Swelling at the front of the head, cheeks or around the eyes occurs
Nasal discharge contains blood
High fever is present
","These are indications that the bacterial infection is severe. Antibiotic treatment is usually prescribed for about 10 days, but shorter courses may be as effective, depending on the bacteria involved. The choice of which antibiotic to use will be based on which bacteria the treating physician thinks are likely to be involved in the infection.[1]",Surgical treatment for bacterial sinusitis,"Surgery is not usually needed for acute bacterial sinusitis. It is only necessary in some cases of chronic sinusitis that do not respond to other forms of treatment. Endoscopic treatment, where a small camera-equipped probe is used to guide and perform the procedure, is one option. In this surgery, the endoscope is used to widen the natural drainage pathways in the sinuses and nose, which improves mucus drainage and cuts down on congestion and the chance of infection.[3]
Rarely, acute bacterial sinusitis may cause an abscess to form near the eye or the brain. In these cases, surgical treatment will be needed to drain the abscess.[1]","Good to know: Complications from bacterial sinusitis are rare, affecting only about one in every ten thousand people with the disorder. However, they are more common among children than adults, so caregivers of children with suspected bacterial sinusitis should exercise caution and be alert for worsening symptoms, swelling or redness of any area of the child’s face.[6]",Prevention,"Taking care to prevent the spread of colds or the flu in the home and community can help prevent some cases of bacterial sinusitis. Seeing a dentist regularly may help to prevent tooth infections, a possible cause of bacterial sinusitis.",FAQs,"Q: Can bacterial sinusitis cause a sore throat?
A: Bacterial sinusitis may be accompanied by postnasal drip, an uncomfortable condition where excess mucus can irritate the  throat.

,,,,,,,,,,What is bacterial vaginosis?
,,,,,,,,,,What is bacterial vaginosis?,"Bacterial vaginosis, also called bacterial vaginitis or BV, is an infection of the vagina caused by an imbalance of various types of natural vaginal bacteria. It is the most common cause of abnormal vaginal discharge and is estimated to affect as many as one in three women at some point in their lives.[1] BV can be a significant source of embarrassment and distress for affected women, but is relatively simple to treat using antibiotics. Long-term problems are rare as a result of bacterial vaginosis, but it can increase the risk of developing various sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV.[2]",Bacterial vaginosis symptoms,"Roughly 50 to 75 percent of women with bacterial vaginosis experience no symptoms. Among those who do, the most common symptom is milky, off-white or grey vaginal discharge, which is often described as having a fishy odour. The discharge tends to be heavier after sexual intercourse or a period.","Symptoms common to other vaginal disorders, such as pain during sex or when urinating, redness and swelling, are not typical of BV. Some women, however, may experience vaginal itching.[2] The Ada app can help you to check your symptoms. Download the app now for a free symptom assessment or find out more here.",Bacterial vaginosis causes,"Bacterial vaginosis occurs when the distribution of vaginal bacteria becomes unbalanced. Normally, the vagina contains a mixture of bacteria, including anaerobic bacteria and lactobacilli. As a result of BV, anaerobic bacteria multiply and the amount of lactobacilli is reduced.[1][2] The precise reason as to why this happens is not known, though it is thought to involve a change in the acidity of the vagina.[1]",Bacterial vaginosis risk factors,"A common misconception about bacterial vaginosis is that it is made more likely by poor vaginal hygiene: this is not true. Conversely, use of certain soaps may in some cases play a role.",Other factors that may contribute to the development of bacterial vaginosis include:[1],"
Sexual activity
Frequently changing sexual partners
A history of sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
Smoking
Use of an intrauterine contraceptive device (IUD)
Being of Afro-Caribbean descent
Having heavy periods
Use of bubble baths
Hormonal changes, including puberty, pregnancy and menopause
Use of sex toys and lubricants
Use of antibiotics

",The birth control pill may also help to prevent the onset of BV.[2],Bacterial vaginosis FAQs,"Q: Is bacterial vaginosis sexually transmitted?
A: Bacterial vaginosis has not traditionally been thought of as being sexually transmitted. This is because, although BV is most common among sexually active women, it can affect women who don’t have or never had sex.[1] Moreover, it cannot be passed from a man to a woman, or vice versa. However, studies show that the condition can be passed from one woman to another through sexual intercourse.[5] It is recommended, therefore, that female partners of women with BV be tested for the condition.","Q: Can men get bacterial vaginosis?
A: No, men cannot contract bacterial vaginosis. The condition is exclusive to the vagina.","Q: Should my partner receive treatment for bacterial vaginosis?

,,,,,,,,,,What is a benign mole?
,,,,,,,,,,What is a benign mole?,"Most moles are benign or harmless. Moles are types of skin growths or lesions, commonly referred to as a nevus (plural: nevi). Nevus is a generalised medical term for a visible, circumscribed, chronic lesion which sits on the skin or mucosa. They can take many different forms, including freckles, moles, skin tags and seborrheic keratoses.[1]","Typically, moles are pink, brown or tan in color with a distinct border. Moles usually develop within the thick layer of living tissue below the epidermis (outer layer of skin), which contains blood capillaries, nerve endings, sweat glands, hair follicles, and other structures. Moles occur when cells in the skin grow in a cluster, forming a lesion, instead of spreading out across the skin.[2]","Some moles develop from cells are called melanocytes, which make the pigment that gives skin its natural color. They can also develop from other cells, including nevus cells. The Ada app can help you check your symptoms. Download the free app or find out more about how it works.",Types of benign moles,The most common types of benign mole include:[3],"
Compound melanocytic nevi, which are usually raised above the skin, light brown and sometimes hairy.
Dermal melanocytic nevi, which are usually raised, pale and sometimes hairy.
Junctional melanocytic nevi, which are usually brown, round and flat.
",Seborrheic keratosis,"A seborrheic keratosis is a kind of skin growth or lesion which usually appears as a brown, black or light tan blemish on the face, chest, shoulders or back. They are usually melanocytic, i.e. melanin-containing, or pigmented.","Seborrheic keratoses are common, and can be scaly, waxy and slightly raised above the skin (elevated). Although these growths are not themselves harmful, they can be difficult to distinguish from malignant melanoma, one of the most serious types of skin cancer, so it is advisable to have them checked to ensure that they are not, in fact, melanomas.[3]","Red, scaly and swollen keratoses","If a keratosis becomes actinic, i.e. red, scaly and swollen, this could indicate that it is precancerous. Actinic seborrheic keratoses, also known as solar keratoses, usually occur as a result of years of sun exposure.[4]","Any suspected actinic keratosis should be checked and removed by a doctor, because, although these lesions are not always malignant, they may develop into melanoma skin cancer if left untreated.",Atypical moles,"Atypical moles are also known as dysplastic nevi, and the term describes unusual-looking moles.","Atypical moles may be mistaken for melanoma, but are not necessarily cancerous or precancerous. However, even though an individual atypical mole may be benign, people who have dysplastic nevi are at increased risk of developing melanoma compared to those who do not. Melanoma can develop in a mole or elsewhere on the body.",Common types of dysplastic nevi include:[5],"
Blue nevus, which is dark blue in color and can be flat or raised.
Dysplastic or atypical nevus, which is also known as “Clark nevi,” this is an unusual looking, slightly larger size of mole with an irregular border.
Halo nevus, which is urrounded by a white ring where the skin has lost its color.
",Causes of benign moles,"Most moles are made of cells called melanocytes which make a pigment called melanin. Melanin has two principal functions: it helps to protect the body from ultraviolet light (UV radiation) from the sun and gives skin and hair its natural color. People with darker complexions have more of these cells, and are more likely to develop new moles after exposure to sunlight.[2]","Moles can occur anywhere on the body. They can be present at birth (congenital), but it is possible for them to develop throughout one’s lifetime (acquired). People can be born with moles, or develop new ones of any size and color throughout their lifetime, at any age. In general, however, darker skin types usually have darker moles.",Changes in benign moles,"Environmental factors such as exposure to sunlight, and hormonal changes such as going through puberty or pregnancy can cause moles to darken or develop.","Therefore, the appearance of moles can change over time. They can change in number and appearance and can also fade away. It is important to familiarise oneself with the lesions on one’s body so as to establish their size, shape and type(s) are normal, as this may be different for every person. This will make it easier to spot atypical lesions or changes to lesions, which could indicate melanoma.","Changes in moles may require a visit to a doctor to determine if the mole is exhibiting dysplasia, i.e. becoming dysplastic. When a lesion becomes dysplastic, this is a sign that it contains abnormal cells or may be undergoing abnormal development. A mole becoming dysplastic may indicate the development of melanomas or carcinomas (cancerous cells).",Read more about Signs of Melanoma »,Identifying cancerous moles,"Melanoma is the most serious type of skin cancer. Melanomas develop from melanin-containing cells, called melanocytes. People with fair skin, red or blond hair or who spend a lot of time in strong sunlight are at higher risk of developing melanoma. It is important to avoid prolonged sun or other UV radiation exposure to reduce the risk of developing dysplastic or cancerous moles.","Good to know: The most common types of non-melanoma skin cancer are basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma. The typical warning sign of non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma is a growth or sore that doesn’t heal, which should be checked by a doctor.",Read more about Melanoma »,Potential indicators that a mole is cancerous include:,"Nevi with three or more different shades of brown or black are particularly likely to be dysplastic, indicative of melanoma or carcinoma. The alphabetic mnemonic (ABCDE)[5] is a useful way to remember the important indicators that an atypical nevus could be cancerous:","
Asymmetry. Changing shape, in particular if lesions develop an irregular edge.
Border. The border or edges of the nevus become ragged, blurred, or irregular.
Color. Getting darker, becoming patchy or multi shaded; its color may have shades of tan, brown, black, blue, white, or red.
Diameter. The nevus may get bigger; enlargement is especially concerning if its diameter becomes larger than the eraser of a pencil.
Elevation/Evolution. The nevus may appear elevated, or raised from the skin, and may look inflamed, bleed or become crusty.
","If a nevus suddenly begins to display any of these signs, it is important to have it examined by a dermatologist; a doctor who specialises in conditions that affect the skin. It is also vital to have nevi checked if they bleed, ooze, itch, appear scaly, or become tender or painful.",Treatment,"If a dermatologist believes a melanocytic nevus needs to be evaluated further to find out whether it is cancerous, they will conduct a biopsy. This involves shaving or cutting it out so that it can be examined under the microscope.","If an atypical nevus is found to contain cancerous melanocytes, the dermatologist will remove the entire mole or scar from the biopsy site by cutting out the entire area, as well as a rim of normal skin around it. They will then suture the wound, i.e. stitch the wound to close it. This treatment is carried out to ensure that any melanoma-containing cells are removed in their entirety, preventing melanoma from spreading elsewhere in the body.",Removing benign moles,"Even though benign moles do not pose health risks such as melanomas, many people opt to have them removed. Most people who seek to have nevi removed do so for cosmetic reasons, for instance, if one is embarrassed about how a particular mole or moles look, or practical reasons such as if they snag on clothing or impede shaving.","Scarring is a possible consequence of removing a mole. With scarring in mind, its location and the likely aesthetic development of the scar should be considered before removal, especially in cases where the procedure has been sought for cosmetic reasons.",Common methods of removing nevi include:[6],"Burning moles off, with an electric current which passes through a wire that becomes hot and is used to burn off the upper layers of the skin. The heat helps prevent bleeding. More than one treatment may be needed to remove a nevus.","Alternatively, the nevus can be cut off the skin. Some nevi may have subcutaneous cells, which reside underneath the skin, so the doctor might need to make a deeper cut to remove the entire mole to prevent it from growing back. The cut may require stitches.","Nevi can also be frozen off with liquid nitrogen. The dermatologist will swab or spray a small amount of super-cold liquid nitrogen on the mole or skin tag. After it has been frozen off, there might be a blister at the site where it was, but this usually heals on its own.",Prevention,"By taking appropriate measures to avoid sun damage, a person can:","
Prevent new nevi from developing
Prevent existing melanocytic nevi from developing melanoma skin cancer
","When spending time in direct sunlight, always:","
Wear sunscreen with a high sun protection factor (SPF), such as SPF 50
Use sun-protective clothing, such as wide-brimmed hats, sleeves and long pants
Seek shade regularly
Stay out of the sunlight between peak hours, (around 10am to 4pm)
","Check the body several times per year, particularly after periods of sun exposure, for any new atypical moles or atypical changes to existing moles, which could indicate melanoma.",Benign mole FAQs,"Q: Can a benign mole grow back after removal?
A: If a mole has been removed by cutting it off so that it is level with the skin, some cells may remain below the skin. These can act as a “seed” and cause it to regrow. It is not possible to predict whether it will grow back. The chances of this are greatly reduced if care is taken to remove the subcutaneous cells during the initial procedure.","Q: Can a benign mole become cancerous?
A: Melanomas can develop anywhere in the surface of the skin, including sites occupied by benign moles or within the melanocytic tissue of the mole itself. For this reason, it is important to consult a physician if a mole undergoes any changes, as these may be signs that it has become cancerous.","**Q: Can a benign mole change color? **
A: Yes. Most commonly, moles change color over time by getting darker after exposure to sunlight. This is not necessarily a cause for concern, but could indicate the presence of melanoma, so it is advisable to consult a doctor. You can also use the free Ada app to check your symptoms."

This condition causes short episodes of dizziness (vertigo) associated with certain head movements. These episodes are caused by particles (crystals) irritating the semicircular canals, the part of the inner ear which regulates balance and equilibrium. Besides dizziness, people with BPPV feel nauseous and may vomit during these attacks. BPPV tends to get better over weeks or months, but may reoccur.",Risks,"Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo can occur at any age, however older people are more commonly affected than children and younger adults. The cause of BPPV is not well understood, however it is thought to be due to a problem in the inner ear caused by particles (crystals) irritating the semicircular canals, the part of the inner ear which regulates balance and equilibrium. In rare cases, head injury can lead to BPPV.",Symptoms,"Recurrent, short attacks of dizziness are the main symptom of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. The dizziness associated with vertigo often feels like the world is spinning, rather than a feeling of lightheadedness. The dizziness may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting and a loss of balance. The attacks often occur after changing position of the head, such as suddenly turning the head, or moving from lying to sitting.",Diagnosis,Diagnosis is made by a doctor with the help of a physical examination.

,,,,,,,,,,What is benign prostatic hyperplasia?
,,,,,,,,,,What is benign prostatic hyperplasia?,"Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate gland (a gland surrounding the neck of the bladder in men). The condition is sometimes also called benign enlargement of the prostate (BEP), in cases where the enlarged prostate reaches or advances beyond a certain size – of around 30 cubic cm.","The condition involves the development of nodules (small swellings), in a zone of the prostate called the transitional zone. These nodules impair the functioning of the urethra – the tube that carries urine out of the body.[1] This impairment often creates various difficulties when urinating.","BPH is common in older men and is, in most cases, a non-serious condition. There is no link to prostate cancer, as the cancer grows in a different zone (peripheral zone) of the prostate. A number of treatment options are available for BPH, and it can usually be managed successfully.[2]",Symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia,The most common symptoms of BPH are related to urination. They include:[3],"
The need to urinate frequently, including at night
Strong urges to urinate, that appear suddenly and may lead to urinary leakage
A weak or interrupted urine stream
Urinary dribbling (where urine slowly leaks out after urination, due to incomplete emptying of the bladder)
The sensation that the bladder is never truly empty (incomplete voiding)
Pain while urinating
Red-tinted urine due to presence of small amounts of red blood cells in urine
","The symptoms of BPH can vary in severity. Some men will experience extremely mild symptoms that require no treatment, while in rarer cases, others – typically those with a full blockage of the urethra – will find it impossible or extremely difficult to urinate.",Causes of benign prostatic hyperplasia,"The exact cause of BPH is unknown, but it is thought mainly to be linked to hormonal changes. Many of these changes naturally affect older men, e.g. declining testosterone levels, which lead to a greater (relative) level of estrogen in the bloodstream.[1]",Some experts believe that a family history of prostate irregularities puts some men at greater risk of developing BPH. Certain genetic factors also seem to play a role in the development of BPH.[4],Diagnosing benign prostatic hyperplasia,"Diagnosing BPH will typically begin with the doctor taking a medical history, including questions to find out if the affected person has a family history of prostate problems, followed by a full medical examination.","The examination will include a digital rectal examination (internal examination of the rectum), through which the doctor will be able to estimate the size, shape and health of the prostate. The rectal examination will also be used to check for the presence of prostate cancer, which, while unconnected to BPH, can be experienced simultaneously with the condition. Other exams and tests may include:[5]","
Urinalysis: Testing a sample of urine to check for a bladder infection which may be causing the symptoms.
Blood tests: To check the levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), a protein produced by the prostate that may increase in volume in men with BPH and prostate cancer. In some cases blood values related to kidney function may also be tested, as the kidneys can sometimes be affected e.g. in cases of severe urinary obstruction.
Uroflowmetry: To check the rate of urine flow during urination. The normal maximal urinary flow rate is more than 15 ml per second. Maximal flow rates of less than 15 ml per second indicate an obstruction at the bladder outlet. Maximal flow rates of less than 10 ml per second (due to BPH) indicate the need for surgery.[1]
Abdominal ultrasound: This imaging technique may be used to detect factors such as increased total prostate volume, an elevated post-void residual urine volume (e.g. more than 100 ml), thickening of the bladder wall and hydronephrosis (swelling of a kidney due to a build up of urine).[1]
Transrectal ultrasound: This imaging technique requires insertion of an ultrasound probe into the rectum of the affected individual. It is carried out only if prostate cancer is suspected, for example in cases of abnormal digital rectal exam results, or elevated serum PSA.
",Benign prostatic hyperplasia treatment,"A variety of treatment options for BPH exist, including medication, minimally invasive therapy and surgery. The treatment route chosen will depend on:[6]","
The severity of the condition
Age
General health
The size of the prostate
",Conservative treatment,"In people with mildly symptomatic BPH, observation of the condition over time, accompanied by some behavioural changes (outlined below) may be sufficient. These behavioural changes may also be employed as a supplementary therapy, for people undergoing medical treatment for BPH. Helpful behavioural changes include:","
Restricting fluid intake before bedtime, and before leaving the house
Choosing non-caffeinated and non-alcoholic beverages
Ensuring the bladder is completely empty by passing urine in the sitting position and double voiding (emptying the bladder twice to ensure complete urination).[7]
",Medication,Medication is the most common method of treating BPH. Options include:,"
Alpha blockers: These drugs relax bladder and urethra muscles, easing urination. They are generally more effective in men with smaller prostates and tend to work rapidly. Side-effects may include dizziness and retrograde ejaculation – a harmless condition in which semen is sent to the bladder instead of being released from the penis.
5-alpha reductase inhibitors: These drugs work by reducing the size of the prostate. They may take roughly six months to become effective and may also cause retrograde ejaculation.
Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors: e.g. Tadalafil. Although this drug is more typically prescribed to treat erectile dysfunction, it has also shown success in treating symptoms of BPH. It is generally only prescribed to those experiencing BPH and erectile dysfunction simultaneously.
","In some cases, the doctor may prescribe a combination of drugs.",Minimally invasive surgery,"For those experiencing moderate to severe BPH, or in cases where medication has proven to be unsuccessful, a range of minimally invasive surgical therapies are available. These include:","
Transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP): Incisions are made in the prostate by passing a lighted scope (tubular viewing instrument) up the urethra, allowing urine to pass more easily through the urethra.
Transurethral microwave thermotherapy (TUMT): An electrode is passed into the prostate and microwaves are emitted in order to shrink the prostate. This therapy can ease urine flow.[8][9]
Transurethral needle ablation (TUNA): Radio waves are passed through needles which have been inserted into the prostate, heating and reducing excess tissue.
Laser therapy: A laser is used to destroy excess prostate tissue, quickly relieving the symptoms of BPH.
Interventions such as the Urolift® system,[10] a non-surgical proprietary device that uses tiny implants to lift the prostate away from the urethra and thereby relieve BPH symptoms that result from pressure on the urethra.
",Classical surgery,Those with severe symptoms or those for whom other treatment methods have proven unsuccessful may require surgery to treat BPH.,"
Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP): By passing a lighted scope up the urethra, a surgeon removes the majority of the prostate. This usually relieves the symptoms of BPH, however, a catheter may be required until the operation site has fully healed.
Open prostatectomy: This is an inpatient procedure in which an incision is made in the abdomen or perineal area, allowing a surgeon access to the prostate to remove excess tissue. It is common for those with a very large prostate or other complicating factors that rule out other treatment options.
",Preventing benign prostatic hyperplasia,"The two main causes of BPH – aging and genetics – cannot be avoided, meaning the condition is difficult to prevent. However, leading a healthy lifestyle may delay the onset of the condition or help manage its symptoms. Lifestyle choices that may help include:[11]","
Maintaining a healthy diet: Fruits and vegetables are high in antioxidants, polyphenols, vitamins and minerals – all substances that may help fight inflammation and reduce the risk of an enlarged prostate. Avoiding fatty, sugary and additive-heavy foods may also help with this.
Maintaining a healthy weight: Some studies have drawn a link between being overweight and BPH. Regular exercise can help with this.
Managing stress: Some studies have suggested that hormonal changes associated with stress may contribute to the onset of BPH.
Don’t wait to urinate: Delaying urination may worsen the symptoms of BPH and can, in some cases, lead to a urinary tract infection.
","Although these lifestyle factors may help delay or manage BPH, even very healthy men can develop BHP, and these preventative measures offer no guarantee against this condition.",Possible complications and risk factors of benign prostatic hyperplasia,"Although BPH is usually a non-serious condition that can be managed effectively, in rare cases complications can arise. These include:[12]","
Urinary tract infection (UTI): Those unable to fully empty their bladder as a result of BPH are at risk of infection. Frequent infection may necessitate the surgical removal of part of the prostate.
Urinary retention: An inability to urinate may call for the insertion of a catheter to drain the urine from the bladder. Surgery may also be necessary.
Bladder stones: These can lead to infection, irritation, blood in the urine and an inability to properly urinate. Bladder stones can be surgically removed.
Bladder damage: BPH, especially when experienced for a prolonged period, can weaken the bladder significantly.
Kidney damage: Built-up pressure from urinary retention can damage the kidneys and allow infections to spread to the kidneys.
Retrograde ejaculation: Almost all of the surgical procedures listed above can lead to retrograde ejaculation into the bladder. This is because the bladder sphincter, which usually keeps semen out of the bladder, can be compromised during surgery. If the shape or function of the bladder sphincter is altered during surgery, it may lose its ability to create a complete seal.
","BPH does not increase, or decrease, the risk of prostate cancer. The peripheral zone (in which prostate cancer can develop) is left intact during the TURP procedure; people who have been treated for BPH are therefore at the same risk of developing prostate cancer as the general male population, so normal prostate cancer screening protocol should be followed.[1]",Benign prostatic hyperplasia FAQs,"Q: Is BPH linked to erectile dysfunction?
A: BPH and erectile dysfunction (ED) are separate problems. However, certain medications used to treat BPH may lead to ED, while, conversely, certain medications used to treat ED can help with BPH. A doctor can help to outline the right treatment plan for an individual.[13]","Q: Are there any natural treatment methods for BPH?
A: A number of natural products are thought by some to help treat BPH. These include:[14]","
Saw palmetto: A herbal remedy that has historically been used to treat urinary problems.
Beta-sitosterol: A mixture of plant extracts containing sitosterol, a cholesterol-like substance thought to help with the symptoms of BPH.
Pygeum: The bark from the African plum tree which has historically been used to treat urinary problems.
Rye grass pollen extract: An extract made from three types of grass pollen that is thought to help relieve the symptoms of BPH.
","It is important to note that such natural treatments are not guaranteed to help prevent BPH or relieve its symptoms, nor should they be seen as an alternative to normal treatment methods. A doctor should always be consulted before using natural treatment methods."

However, it is still considered an effective treatment.[21]",Taking lithium reduces the chances of having a manic episode within the next year by 30 to 40 percent.,Anticonvulsant medication,"Valproate is an anticonvulsant medication which was originally developed to treat epilepsy. It is increasingly used to treat bipolar disorder as a mood stabilizer, particularly in the United States. It is not yet clear how the drug works.","Valproate is used to treat mania, rapid cycling and mixed episodes. It is sometimes prescribed along with lithium, as there is a suggestion that the two work more effectively together.[22]","Valproate can cause damage to a developing fetus, and should not be taken by women of childbearing age.[23]",Other side effects may include:,"
Nausea
Feeling shaky
Diarrhea
Increased appetite and associated weight gain
Changes to levels of ammonia and platelets in the blood
",Carbamazepine and lamotrigine are anticonvulsants that are also used as mood stabilizers. Carbamazepine is thought to be more effective at treating rapid cycling than lithium and causes fewer side effects. Lamotrigine is generally prescribed for treating bipolar II disorder.[16],Antipsychotic medication,"Antipsychotic medications, such as olanzapine and quetiapine, are used to treat mania. They can also be used in conjunction with mood stabilizers to prevent mania occurring.[24]","Antipsychotic medications help by treating bipolar disorder with psychotic features, such as hearing voices, delusions and racing thoughts. They can also help to prevent extreme mood swings and, in some cases, can be used to treat severe depression.[17]",These medications work by blocking dopamine in the brain. Side effects may include:,"
Feeling sleepy and sluggish
Weight gain
Lack of interest in sexual activity
Increased chance of developing diabetes
High doses can cause limbs to be stiff and shaky
",Antidepressants,Antidepressant medications are used to treat moderate to severe episodes of depression.,"For some people, there is a risk that treatment with antidepressants alone can trigger an episode of mania or make rapid cycling more likely. For this reason, it’s recommended that antidepressants, such as fluoxetine[25], should be prescribed alongside a mood stabilizer.[26]",SSRI antidepressants can take two to six weeks to start affecting mood. They are thought to work by increasing levels of serotonin in the brain.,"There are many potential side effects when using SSRIs, though most wear off after a few weeks. These side effects include:[17][25]","
Anxiety
Nausea
Upset stomach
Dizziness
Not sleeping enough or sleeping too much
Low sex drive
","It is important not to stop taking SSRIs too soon so as to prevent a recurrence of depression. A course of six to nine months is usually recommended, though in more severe cases, it may be advisable to continue taking SSRIs for longer. A doctor should be consulted before stopping treatment with SSRIs.[27][28]",Psychological treatments for bipolar disorder,"In between episodes of mania or hypomania and depression, cognitive behavioral or psychotherapy treatments can help. Psychotherapy usually takes place in sessions of one hour over periods of several months.[28]",Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT),Cognitive behavioral therapy is a form of talking therapy that focuses on how thoughts and beliefs affect feelings and behavior. CBT teaches participants coping skills to recognize and deal with problems.[29],"For people with bipolar disorder, CBT can help improve awareness of behavior, compliance with treatment plans and day-to-day coping skills. When used alongside medication, a study of 19 randomized control trials found that CBT is effective in reducing the relapse rate and the severity of symptoms.[30]",Self monitoring,"Learning to recognize signs of moods swinging out of control is an important step in managing bipolar disorder. Recognizing early signs can lead to intervention and prevent full episodes of mania and depression, and avoid potential hospitalization.","Keeping a mood diary is helpful to track long-term mood changes, as well as possible triggers.",Other forms of psychotherapy for bipolar disorder,"Psychoeducation can help by providing more information about bipolar disorder to the person with the condition, as well as their family and friends.[31]","Led by a therapist, group psychoeducation brings together people with similar experiences to share knowledge about how bipolar disorder can affect behavior and how to manage symptoms.","Family therapy can help by working together as a family to strengthen relationships, identify risks and develop support skills.",Other treatments for bipolar disorder,"There are other potential treatments for bipolar disorder if medication and psychotherapeutic interventions are not successful, or if the condition is extreme.",Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT),"Electroconvulsive therapy is a treatment that sends electrical current through the brain to trigger an epileptic seizure. The electricity is administered under general anesthetic and with the use of muscle relaxants, so the body does not convulse.[32]","ECT is only advised for rapid, short-term relief of severe depression, mania or psychosis, where other interventions have failed and/or when the condition is considered life-threatening.","ECT causes memory loss, which is usually short-term but can be very disorienting.",New treatments,"There is ongoing research into new mood-stabilizing drugs. Other, non-medication therapies, are also being investigated, including vagal nerve stimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation and light therapy.",Self care in the management of bipolar disorder,"As well as monitoring day-to-day behavior for signs of mood changes, the knowledge gained from such monitoring can be used to avoid triggering an episode of mania or depression.[33]","It can help to have someone to confide in. Close relationships with people who understand the condition and the individual’s experience and trigger points, can be useful as a support network.","Too much activity can trigger a manic episode, so it’s helpful to maintain a balance between work and activity, and relaxation and fun.",Stress and bipolar disorder,"Stress is a common trigger, and avoiding highly stressful situations is recommended. However, it’s not possible to avoid all stress, so a useful tool may be to learn relaxation techniques or take advice on handling stress from a qualified therapist.[34][35]",Healthy lifestyle,"There is no specific diet recommended for bipolar disorder. However, maintaining a healthy diet will help with overall wellness.[36][37] This includes:","
Eating a balance of foods rich in nutrients, such as fruits, vegetables, pulses, whole grains, fish, eggs, low-fat meat, nuts and seeds
Avoiding food that is high in saturated and trans fats, such as red meat, as well as simple carbohydrates such as refined sugar
","Lithium can affect salt levels in the body, so care should be taken not to eat too much or too little.[19]",Caffeine may contribute to a manic or hypomanic episode by disrupting normal sleep patterns.[38],"Exercising for 20 minutes, three times a week, helps to maintain fitness. Exercise also releases endorphins into the brain, which improve mood.[39]",Bipolar disorder in women,The presentation and course of bipolar disorder differs in men and women.,The following features of bipolar disorder tend to be more common in women than in men:[40][41],"

","Women with bipolar disorder tend to have more depressive symptoms and different accompanying conditions than men. There is a high risk of symptoms recurring after giving birth and during menopause. Bipolar disorder in women also correlates with increased risk of sexually transmitted diseases, weight gain, unplanned pregnancies and cardiovascular disease.","Gender is not thought to affect response to mood stabilizing medication, though treatment can pose a risk to the developing fetus in pregnant women. Pregnancy does not protect from nor exacerbate bipolar disorder, so many women require continuation of medication during this time. The time after giving birth, the so-called postpartum period, however, does increase the risk of onset and recurrence of bipolar disorder.",Pregnancy and bipolar disorder,"Women with bipolar disorder who are pregnant, or plan to become pregnant, should talk to their doctor to assess whether their medications are suitable and to discuss how to manage mood during and after pregnancy.[42]","Women of childbearing age should not take valproate. If taken while pregnant, there is a high risk of harm to the developing fetus.[22]","Lithium is safer than other mood stabilizers to take during pregnancy. There is a low risk to the fetus of developing a heart valve defect during the first three months, but lithium is safe after 26 weeks. Babies should not be breastfed if the mother is taking lithium.[20]",Postpartum illnesses are more common for women with bipolar disorder than for the general population. Postpartum depression and postpartum psychosis are both serious conditions which could affect a woman’s ability to take care of herself and/or her baby.[43],Postpartum depression,Around 25 percent of women with bipolar disorder who give birth will experience postpartum depression.[43],"Postnatal depression can start at any point in the first year after birth.

The most common symptoms are blood in the urine (hematuria) and urination problems. Treatment and the outcome after having bladder cancer depend on the size and type of cancer.",Risks,"Bladder cancer is more common in men than women, and becomes more likely with age. People who smoke, or who are exposed to cigarette smoke, have a higher risk of bladder cancer. Exposure to some industrial chemicals and fumes, including arsenic, benzene and diesel exhaust, also increases the risk of developing this condition. Persistent or often-recurring bladder infections also increase one's risk.",Symptoms,"Typical symptoms include blood in the urine (hematuria) and urination problems, such as pain when urinating, urinating more frequently and feeling a sudden urge to urinate. Some people may have recurring urinary tract infections (bladder or kidney infections). Other symptoms may include pain low in the belly or in the back and swelling of the legs.",Diagnosis,"Diagnosis is based on the symptoms and, occasionally, the physical examination. A urine analysis can be done to look for blood and cancer cells in the urine. A cystoscopy (looking at the inside of the bladder with a camera) will be done to confirm the diagnosis and to take a sample of the cancer for further investigation. A computed tomography (CT) scan is also helpful in investigating whether the cancer has spread to other locations.",Treatment,"Treatment of bladder cancer depends on the size of the cancer, the exact type of cancer and whether the cancer has spread.

Thesed personality traits tend to develop in people who have had a difficult childhood or adolescence. Treatment can be achieved through psychological counseling.",Risks,"The personality is the way that a person reacts to people and events in their life. The personality is formed during childhood as a result of family relationships, childhood experiences and difficulties. Personality traits may also be partially inherited from one's parents. If people develop personality traits which cause them difficulty in their life, this is called a personality disorder. A major cause of borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a traumatic life experience in childhood. This may include parental neglect, sexual abuse or physical violence. This condition is relatively common; it is estimated that up to 3% of the general population may have the personality traits of BPD. It tends to affect women more commonly than men. The personality traits tend to cause the most problems in early adulthood and become less troublesome as people grow older.",Symptoms,"People with a borderline personality tend to have unstable moods and difficulty controlling their thoughts and emotions. They may often feel conflicting emotions. These people tend to act impulsively and, sometimes, aggressively.

They may also be involved in risky behaviors, such as drug consumption, eating disorders, and a tendency to cause themselves harm.",Diagnosis,"The diagnosis of borderline personality disorder is made after a thorough psychological assessment, which considers multiple aspects of a person's life. The diagnosis is often difficult as people with borderline personality disorder have often had multiple complicated experiences which have formed their personality. To make the diagnosis of borderline personality disorder, a doctor should exclude other causes for the symptoms, such as depression, anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder.",Treatment,"Therapy aims to teach people with these personality traits how to manage difficulties and relationships and how to manage impulsive behavior. This is usually done by a psychologist. It can take time for a person with BPD to learn new ways of dealing with problems, but this therapy can be effective if a person is determined. Medications might be prescribed to help symptoms of depression or anxiety, because people with BPD often also have these conditions.",Prevention,"It is difficult to prevent borderline personality disorder.

People with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, cardiovascular diseases (such as heart attacks or previous strokes) or who have family members with these conditions are at increased risk. Typical symptoms include dizziness, vertigo, imbalance, and impaired vital functions like breathing and heartbeat. Recovery after a stroke depends on the size of the area of brain which was involved. In some cases, this can be a life threatening condition, though this is uncommon. Many people recover well with physical therapy and treatment of the cause of their stroke.",Risks,"Brain stem infarcts are caused by an interruption in the blood supply to the brain stem, either due to a blockage in the blood vessels (ischemic stroke), or due to bleeding in the brain stem (hemorrhagic stroke). This condition is more common in men, and becomes more common with age. People with atrial fibrillation (an abnormal heart rhythm), high blood pressure, high cholesterol, cardiovascular diseases and family history of stroke or mini-stroke are at increased risk of stroke. Smoking, alcohol abuse and physical inactivity also increase the risk of developing this condition.",Symptoms,"The symptoms can be very different from person to person, and depend on the area of the brain affected. Common symptoms are dizziness, imbalance, hearing loss and double vision. Some people lose feeling or become weak in their face, arms or legs. Some people experience persistent hiccups, nausea, vomiting or breathing difficulties.",Diagnosis,"The diagnosis is usually made by an experienced doctor or neurologist based on the symptoms, a clinical examination, and a CT (computed tomography) or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan of the brain. A Doppler ultrasound of the neck arteries and an angiography may also be performed to look for blockages in other blood vessels. Other tests may include an electrocardiogram and blood tests for kidney and liver function.",Treatment,"A possible brain stem infarct requires urgent review by a doctor. The treatment is dependent on the type of infarct, and symptoms. If bleeding has caused the stroke, this may need to be stopped using a clip or coil. If blockage in a blood vessel has caused the stroke, these can be dissolved with help of medication. The long-term treatment depends on the consequences of the stroke, but physical therapy and speech therapy are helpful. Some people may need to take medication to thin the blood in order to prevent another stroke.",Prevention,"Regular exercise, losing weight, and giving up smoking, alcohol or drug abuse can help prevent the chances of a stroke.

Burnout can affect anyone, but tends to commonly affect people in jobs which are physically and emotionally stressful (such as nurses, doctors, police, social workers, etc.) or people going through or supporting a loved one through a stressful life event.",Symptoms,"Symptoms of burnout can be both physical and emotional. Physical symptoms include headache or back pain, disturbed sleep, nausea, tense muscles and tiredness. Emotionally, people with burnout feel irritable, tense, and unmotivated. They may also feel indifferent (not care about things) and cynical, and may socially distance themselves from others. Affected people may lose confidence in their work, feel unproductive and overloaded.",Diagnosis,A diagnosis of burnout is made by a doctor. The medical definition of burnout differs from the common usage. But a early diagnosis may help a person more quickly regain a healthy work-life balance.,Treatment,"There is not a single method for treating burnout, but affected people may cope better with stress by adjusting their attitude (rediscovering enjoyable aspects of work, reevaluating priorities and goals), resting (taking short breaks throughout the day, sleeping more), and taking time to recharge themselves outside of work (spending time doing enjoyable things outside of work, seeking support from family and friends, exercising, etc.).",Prevention,"Since burnout usually develops over a long period of time, attention to tell-tale signs, like feeling constantly overloaded at work, may help with prevention. Affected people may find that working within their abilities, developing healthy habits (e.g. regular meal times and exercise), and finding strategies to counter stress may help with prevention. Preventing burnout is sometimes an ongoing process, so finding reliable sources of emotional support is important."
,,,,,,,,,,What is a CT angiogram / CT angiography (CTA)?
,,,,,,,,,,What is a CT angiogram / CT angiography (CTA)?,CT angiography (CTA) is an imaging technique which produces pictures of vertical slices of the body. It is used to look at the blood vessels and to detect any problems related to blood flow around the body.,"Angiography and arteriography are slightly different imaging techniques which may be used interchangeably by one’s doctor. Arteriography is used to refer to techniques which produce images of the arteries, specifically. Angiography is an umbrella term used to describe the process of imaging all kinds of blood vessels. This can involve visualising blood vessels (arteries and veins) throughout the body, including the head and blood vessels in various organs. Usually, this is facilitated with the help of specific contrast materials.","CTA is performed by a specialist doctor/physician called a radiologist using a computerised tomography scanner. This is a large ring-shaped piece of hospital equipment which creates detailed virtual  cross-sectional or multidimensional images of the blood vessels while the body passes through it, lying on a motorized bed.","The images produced are called CT angiograms. The person undergoing CTA will usually be injected, usually in a vein in their arm, with a special dye called contrast material which makes particular blood vessels show up in the images taken by the CT scanner.","The radiologist will analyse the images and produce a radiology report to give to the doctor who ordered the scan. Doctors can use radiology reports from CTA to diagnose accurately and/or rule out a wide range of conditions, such as cardiovascular diseases (diseases which affect the heart or blood vessels), often much earlier on in their course than would be possible by many other means.",CTA is typically used by doctors for:,"
Confirming suspected conditions: for example, a pulmonary embolism in the lung can be diagnosed with the aid of CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA).
Identifying the cause of unexplained symptoms: headaches or seizures, which are unexplained, may indicate the presence of a range of possible underlying conditions and are typical reasons why a doctor may suggest CTA.
Assessing internal damage: CTA can be useful in identifying problems, such as internal bleeding related to an area that has been injured — or that may have been injured — in an accident.
","Types of CTA include scans of a particular blood vessels, such as a CT aortogram (of the aorta, the body’s biggest blood vessel), or scans of an area of the body containing several blood vessels, such as a CT coronary angiogram (an overall scan of the blood vessels in the heart) or a CT pulmonary angiogram (an overall scan of the blood vessels in the lungs).",Common types of CTA include:,"
CT aortogram (of the aorta, the body’s biggest, main artery)
CT carotid angiogram (of the head and neck)
CT cerebral angiogram (of the brain)
CT coronary angiogram (of the heart)
CT pelvic angiogram (of the stomach, including its lower part, ending at the legs)
CT peripheral angiogram (of the arms and legs)
CT pulmonary angiogram (of the lungs)
",People who are scheduled for a CT angiogram can generally undergo the procedure as an outpatient and can leave the hospital the same day.,What conditions does CTA screen for?,"CTA is used to look for, identify and confirm a variety of conditions. With the insights gained from the angiograms, doctors can begin to treat the affected person much earlier on in the course of the disease than would otherwise be possible. Feeling unwell? Get a free symptom assessment with the Ada app.",Aneurysms,"Aneurysms can occur anywhere in the body, but are most common in the aorta (the body’s main artery), brain, intestines, legs (especially the arteries behind the knees) and spleen. Aneurysms are the result of a weakened blood vessel wall, which can occur due to high blood pressure weakening the arteries caused by external factors like major accidents , but is also often hereditary. When the weakened area bulges, it becomes filled with blood and is more likely to rupture. This can cause internal bleeding, serious complications and even, in case of a rupture, death. It is possible to have an aneurysm without knowing about it or perceiving any signs or symptoms.","A CT angiogram for aneurysms is usually performed as a way of ruling out an aneurysm, when unspecific symptoms or certain signs are in the foreground upon examination. For example, in a case of severe recurring headaches or when the doctor finds a pulsating aortic mass on a physical examination of the abdomen.",Blockages,"CTA can detect the formation of blood clots or the build-up of plaque (a substance primarily composed of fat, cholesterol and calcium) in the blood vessels around the body. CTA has been found to be often more reliable than other methods of testing for blockages.",Congenital abnormalities,"Birth defects, such as malformations of the heart or other blood vessels, can be detected with CTA.",Coronary artery disease (CAD),"This is a group of diseases including myocardial infarction (heart attack), stable and unstable angina (problems with blood flow to the heart due to obstruction or spasm of the arteries) and sudden cardiac death (where the heart stops functioning unexpectedly). There may be no symptoms present for CAD, but many people experience chest pain which travels to the neck, back, arm, jaw or shoulder.","High blood cholesterol, smoking, poor diet and excessive alcohol consumption are all risk factors for CAD, as they make the arteries less effective at transporting oxygenated blood to the heart.CAD is the most common cause of death globally. [1]",CT coronary angiograms are one of the most common type of CT angiogram and are prescribed as a matter of course to detect coronary heart disease — the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States[2].,Factors which render a person at high risk of developing coronary heart disease include:[3],"
High blood pressure
High LDL (low density lipoprotein) cholesterol, or bad cholesterol
Low HDL (high density lipoprotein) cholesterol, or good cholesterol
A family history of coronary heart disease
Smoking tobacco
Being post-menopausal (in women)
Being older than 45 (in men)
Having diabetes
Being obese
",Diseases of the vessels of the kidneys,"Problems which affect the blood vessels going to and from the kidneys can be diagnosed with the aid of a renal angiogram. The procedure may also be carried out to visualise the blood vessels in and around the kidneys before a kidney transplant or before the insertion of a stent (a thin, flexible tube which helps stabilize structures of the urinary system like the ureter, running from kidney to bladder after, for example, kidney stone removal.",Disordered blood vessels,"CTA can identify areas where blood vessels have been modified in their structure through various conditions and/or the body’s reactions to these conditions, so that they no longer transport the blood around the body effectively. Conditions which involve these changes of the blood vessels include:","
Peripheral vascular disease (PVD), a condition in which blood circulation disorder causes the blood vessels outside of the heart to block, narrow, spasm or become dilated. This can affect arteries or veins and typically causes pain and fatigue, often in the legs and especially during exercise. In case of the arteries being affected, this would then be called Peripheral artery disease (PAD). Pain related to PAD usually improves with rest. In the case of the veins being affected, this most often shows as dilated or varicose veins of the legs.
Arteritis/vasculitis (inflammation of the arteries)
",Injury,"When the body sustains an injury, the blood vessels can be affected. This is not always easily detected by examining the outside of the body, and a CT angiogram may be prescribed to survey the extent of any internal damage.",Pulmonary embolism,"This condition involves a blockage (such as a blood clot) obstructing the pulmonary artery, which carries blood to the lungs or one of its many branches. This can be life-threatening, as oxygen-rich blood will be prevented from reaching the lungs. Blood clots, which obstruct the lungs, usually form in the legs as a result of a condition called deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and travel up the body towards the pulmonary artery. Leading an active lifestyle to improve one’s blood circulation, avoiding smoking tobacco and drinking alcohol, and refraining from staying still for long periods (for example, on long-haul flights) can help prevent DVT.",Tumours,"Before beginning treatment following the discovery of tumours, a doctor will often use CTA to investigate the arteries which are carrying blood to the tumour. It is important for the doctor to be able to visualise the blood vessels in the affected area when they are planning the treatment programme or deciding on a treatment.",Who is CTA suitable for?,"In general, adults, children and even babies can undergo a CT angiogram without any adverse effects or complications. However, CTA is more commonly prescribed for adults, and is used to scan for a wider range of conditions in adults than in children or babies. CTA may not be suitable for people who are known to be allergic to contrast material.",Doctors may consider using alternative methods to CTA when they are examining people with one or more of the following characteristics:,"
A history of allergic reactions to contrast material
Unstable pulse or blood pressure
Impaired kidney function
","For people who are pregnant and/or who are undergoing radiation therapy to treat other conditions, the decision to prescribe a CT angiogram will be taken by the doctor, in discussion with the affected person, on a case-by-case basis.",Factors which will be taken into consideration include:,"
The type of angiogram
The condition(s) to be screened for
The cumulative (total) amount of radiation that the individual would be exposed to over the course of the total number of procedures that they are scheduled to undergo which involve radiation
Whether the area of the body to be screened includes the womb and/or the unborn child
The timeline of the pregnancy: after 15 weeks, the foetus is considered to be sufficiently developed that the risks from the exposure to radiation, that a single scan involves, are thought to be negligible. (See FAQs.)
",Preparation,A person who is scheduled for a CT angiogram may often be advised to avoid eating or drinking for a number of hours before the procedure. The exact length of this period depends on the body parts being examined and how extensive the angiogram will be. Talk to a doctor about the details of any forthcoming scan and follow their advice about how to prepare.,"Please talk to the doctor beforehand about how to take prescribed or OTC medication  before the scan and on the day of the scan. Usually, there is no need to change one’s medication regimen before the scan.","On the day of the procedure, the person undergoing a CT angiogram will be asked to remove their clothing, jewelry and any other metal objects (such as a removable mouth-brace). A loose gown will be provided by the hospital. If they feel anxious about the scan, a sedative (medication which relaxes and calms individuals) may be provided. A sedative may also be prescribed if the person being scanned is a young child, or for anybody who experiences difficulties remaining still.",Contrast material,"Almost all CT angiograms require the use of a contrast material. This is a dye which can be seen by X-ray equipment. For an angiogram, contrast material is injected into the body through a vein, making the blood vessels stand out from the rest of the image. Contrast material is normally harmless and passes out of the body during urination following the scan.","However, before administering contrast material, the doctor will check the clinical history of the individual to ascertain whether it is suitable. Contrast material may cause kidney damage in people who have previously experienced kidney problems. If a person has a history of asthma, or previous allergic reactions to contrast material, the chances of experiencing an adverse allergic reaction are heightened. Often, counter measures can be taken to ensure that these people are able to undergo an CT examination if needed.[4]",During the CTA,"The CT scanner is made up of the scanning device (a large ring containing X-ray equipment) and a motorized bed. During a CT angiogram, the person lies down on the motorized bed of the scanner and remains as still as possible. The radiologist will operate the CT scanner from a separate room. The person undergoing CTA will be able to communicate with the radiologist throughout the procedure using an intercom. During the procedure, the person may be asked to breathe out or hold their breath at certain points to ensure the clarity of the images.",After the CTA,"Following a CT angiogram, the images collected are processed by a computer. They will depict cross-sections (slices) of the body, in which the blood vessels under examination are differentiated from the rest of the image by the contrast material. The radiologist will analyse the images, taking into account the person’s medical history and any suspected diagnoses, and produce a radiology report. The report will usually be passed to the doctor who ordered the scan. It is normal to wait days, or in rare cases, even weeks to receive the results of a CT angiogram.","Almost all CT angiograms require the use of contrast material. Therefore a person who was injected with contrast material for a CT angiogram is usually asked to wait in the hospital for up to an hour so that they can be monitored for signs of an allergic reaction. It is important to drink plenty of fluids after the scan and over the following day to flush the contrast material out of one’s system. If a sedative was used, a family member or friend should accompany the affected person home, and they should avoid driving or operating machinery for the rest of the day.",CT angiography in comparison to regular and MRI angiography,"For someone who has been prescribed an angiogram, there are several factors to consider in order to decide whether a CT angiogram is the most suitable option for their needs. The doctor will decide whether CT, MRI or regular angiography is suitable on a case-by-case basis.",Invasive or non invasive,One of the most important aspects of the experience to consider is whether the recommended scan will be an invasive or a non-invasive procedure.,"Traditional angiography is an invasive procedure in which an incision is made in the skin so that the contrast material can be administered using a catheter, whilst X-rays are used to create the images. A local anaesthetic will be used to numb the area before the catheter is inserted. Catheters are thin, flexible tubes which are tailor-made for a range of different functions, like in this case administering the contrast material.","The other types of angiography — computed tomography (CT) angiograms and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) angiograms  — are non-invasive procedures. This means that they can be performed by injecting the contrast material into the relevant part of the body through a vein, without the need to use an anaesthetic. CT and MRI angiography are generally preferred by patients for these reasons in comparison to invasive, regular angiography.",Level of detail,"An important advantage of CTA over regular angiography is that it is possible for the radiologist to view and evaluate bones, soft tissues and blood vessels all at the same time. This increases the possibility that a single angiography session will be enough to reveal everything that the doctor needs to know in order to accurately diagnose and therefore later on properly treat the affected person.","In the case of coronary artery disease (CAD)  using CT angiography was shown to be more sensitive and also more specific than an MRI angiography. This means that that the coronary artery disease will be more likely properly diagnosed with CT angiography. Furthermore when CT angiography is used to screen for CAD, this allows the radiologist to perform a scan using less contrast material than an MRI angiography would require.[5]","However, in general, the suitability of CT or MRI angiography depends on the body part being scanned and the condition(s) to be screened for.",What can be accomplished during each scanning procedure?,A CT angiogram can be used for diagnosis or investigation. A separate treatment plan must be devised based on the findings.,"For this reason, somebody who is undergoing a coronary angiogram because of a possible problem with their heart may, in some cases, be recommended a regular angiogram rather than a CT coronary angiogram. CTA is generally preferred by patients as the quicker and less painful option for a scan.","However, use of a catheter in regular angiography makes it possible to sometimes combine diagnosis and treatment in a single procedure. It is for example possible to identify and treat an aneurysm or restore blood flow to a part of the body by removing a blood clot or blockage via the catheter during the scan itself with a regular coronary angiography – avoiding the need for further treatment.",CTA FAQs,"Q: Is CTA safe?
A: The radiation-related risks associated with CTA are far outweighed by the benefits. CTA gives doctors the ability to make rapid and accurate diagnoses and prescribe appropriate treatments for otherwise harder-to-identify conditions. However, care must still be taken to minimize the exposure to radiation from the X-ray equipment. Being exposed to X-rays is often associated with an increased risk of developing cancer later on.","It is advisable to limit the number of X-rays performed on a single person — including those associated with CTA  — to those which are absolutely necessary. However, CT scanners have sophisticated radiation dose controls to minimize the risk of developing cancer as much as possible. Furthermore, it is possible to opt for a low-dose radiation X-ray in all cases where a lesser quality CT angiogram will be sufficient to make a diagnosis.","Q: Is CTA suitable for someone who is pregnant?
A: In the early stages of pregnancy, the foetus is most at risk of experiencing adverse effects from being exposed to the ionizing radiation involved in CTA. For this reason, it is recommended that pregnant women do not undergo CTA during the first fifteen weeks of their pregnancy, if the purpose of the scan is to produce an angiogram showing a section of the body which includes the gravid uterus (the area containing the foetus).","From fifteen weeks post-conception, the foetus is considered to have developed sufficiently for there to be a negligible risk of damage from exposure to the ionizing radiation involved in a single scan. At this point, it is generally considered that the risk of damage to the unborn child is outweighed by the benefits of performing a CT angiogram in order to diagnose and treat any conditions which may affect the mother and unborn child if left untreated. There is no reason for a pregnant woman to avoid contrast material at any point in the pregnancy, so intravenous contrast material can be administered as needed.[6]","Q: Is CTA suitable for children
A: Due to technological advances, contemporary CTA can be performed even on newborn children. The range of reasons that CTA is usually performed on children is narrower than for adults. In children, CTA is most often used to assess congenital diseases (birth defects), postoperative vascular diseases (abnormal conditions that can develop in the blood vessels and veins as a result of surgery) and cardiac diseases. One advantage of performing CTA on children is that it can be possible to avoid long periods of sedation, which are associated with MRI angiography and reduce high-intensity radiation exposure, which is associated with regular angiography.[7] If you are concerned about the health of you or a loved one, get a free symptom assessment with the Ada app."

A: The principal difference between CT scans and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans is that CT scans use X-rays to produce their images, while MRI scans use radio frequency pulses and magnetic fields. The MRI scanner is shaped like a tube and surrounds the whole body at once. An MRI scanner is more likely to make a person feel claustrophobic than the ring-shaped CT scanner.

It is normal to wait days or sometimes even a few weeks to receive the results of a CT scan.","CT imaging scans are generally painless and non-invasive, so most people do not experience any adverse effects. In most cases, individuals should be able to leave the hospital when the scan is complete. If no sedatives or contrast material was used, day-to-day activities can be continued as normal.","If a contrast material was used, a wait in the hospital of roughly an hour may be necessary in order to monitor for signs of an allergic reaction. Sometimes these allergic reactions, especially the ones affecting the skin, may be quite delayed. In this case, or when in doubt, it is always best to contact one’s doctor to be safe.","If a sedative was used, leaving the hospital by onself is not recommmended. a friend or family member will normally be asked to accompany the person who underwent the scan home, and they should avoid driving or operating machinery for the rest of the day.",CT scan (head) FAQs,"Q: What are the risks of undergoing a CT scan of the head?
A: CT scanning involves exposure to some X-ray radiation. Doctors generally agree that the risks are low compared to the potential risk of not being diagnosed with a dangerous health problem. The risk from a single scan is small, but it increases if an individual has many X-rays or CT scans over time. Newer imaging scanners can make it possible to encounter less exposure to radiation than older models.","Q: I am pregnant. Will undergoing a CT scan of the head affect my unborn child?
A: Although the risk of damage from radiation is usually considered insignificant in comparison to the benefits of performing the scan, it is advisable to tell the doctor if the person undergoing the scan is pregnant. They may be able to avoid exposing the unborn child to radiation completely by examining the head using other tests which do not involve such a high level of exposure to radiation, such as a head MRI scan or ultrasound.","Q: Can the head and neck be assessed during the same CT scan?
A: The head and neck can be assessed during the same procedure. It is particularly common after an accident for a CT scan or X-ray to be used to check for damage to the bones in the person's neck and head at the same time. If all possible conditions can be screened for using a CT scan, the head and neck will be assessed during the same procedure. Otherwise, the neck can be assessed separately, using whatever method of scanning is most appropriate to screen for the suspected condition(s).","Q: What is the difference between a CT scan of the head and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan?
A: The principal difference between CT and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scanning is that CT scans use X-rays to produce their images, while MRI scans use radio frequency pulses and magnetic fields. The MRI scanner is shaped like a tube and surrounds the whole body at once. An MRI scanner is more likely to make a person feel claustrophobic than the ring-shaped CT scanner. However, the images produced by MRI scans have the potential to reveal any difference between normal and abnormal non-skeletal tissue more clearly than images from a CT scan.",A CT scan is more likely than an MRI scan to be used to investigate acute health issues as it is faster to perform. An MRI scan is more likely than an CT scan to be used for investigating soft tissue abnormalities.,"For someone who has been prescribed a scan, there are several factors to consider in order to decide whether a CT scan or an MRI scan is the most suitable option. The most important of these is what condition(s) or changes are being scanned for. Based on an assessment of a person’s medical history and the diagnostic and/or imaging purpose of the scan, the doctor will decide whether CT or MRI scanning is suitable.[4]"
,,,,,,,,,,What is candida vulvovaginitis?
,,,,,,,,,,What is candida vulvovaginitis?,"Candida vulvovaginitis, also known as vaginal thrush or a vaginal yeast infection, is a common infection of the vulva and vagina caused by a fungal yeast called candida. Candida is normally present in small amounts on the body but, under certain circumstances, it can overgrow, causing an infection. It is not normally a sexual transmitted infection, but can sometimes be passed between sexual partners. Main symptoms include vulval itchiness, pain during sexual intercourse and vaginal discharge. Thrush can be easily treated with over-the-counter medications. It can reoccur, especially at times of stress, or in people who have diabetes or immune system disorders.",Risks,"This condition is caused by a yeast, candida albicans, which normally lives on the body. Under certain circumstances, candida can overgrow and cause a troublesome infection. This is a very common condition in adult women, but can affect females of all ages. Though it is not considered a sexual transmitted infection (STI), it is more common in people who are sexually active. Other risk factors include the use of antibiotics, pregnancy, a weakened immune system and diabetes. Some people find that humid, warm climate conditions make them more susceptible to this condition.",Symptoms,"The most common symptoms of this condition are itchiness and burning of the vulva and vagina and a thick, clumpy, white discharge. Some people also experience pain or discomfort during urination or sexual intercourse.",Diagnosis,"The diagnosis is usually based on the symptoms and physical examination. If the diagnosis is uncertain, a sample of the vaginal discharge may be taken and investigated for the yeast.",Treatment,"Treatment consists of anti-fungal medication, which can be applied as a cream to the vulva, as a pessary in the vagina, or taken in tablet form. Although many people find tablets convenient, the creams and pessaries are often soothing to the itchy, sore skin.",Prevention,"Avoiding underwear which traps heat and moisture can help to prevent this condition, especially in humid climates. Avoiding the use of antibiotic tablets if another preparation is appropriate (such as an antibiotic cream or ointment) may also be helpful. Maintaining good blood sugar control also helps to prevent this condition from developing in diabetic people.",Other names for candida vulvovaginitis,"

,,,,,,,,,,What are cardiovascular disease risk factors?
,,,,,,,,,,What are cardiovascular disease risk factors?,"Risk factors for cardiovascular disease are particular habits, behaviors, circumstances or conditions that increase a person’s risk of developing cardiovascular disease, including lack of exercise, unhealthy eating, smoking, diabetes, age and family history.","Cardiovascular disease is a broad, umbrella term used to describe all conditions affecting the heart and circulatory system, including coronary heart disease, stroke, heart attack and aortic disease.[1]","Good to know: Cardiovascular disease is sometimes called “heart disease”, but in medical terms, they are not exactly the same thing. Heart disease is a general term for conditions affecting the structure of the heart and the way it functions. All heart diseases are cardiovascular diseases. However, not all cardiovascular diseases are heart diseases. An example is stroke, which affects blood vessels in the brain, but not the heart itself.[2]","As detailed below, cardiovascular disease risk factors can be split into two categories: modifiable and non-modifiable.[3]","Possessing one or more risk factors increases a person’s risk of developing cardiovascular disease; it does not, however, mean that cardiovascular disease is an inevitability.[1] If you think that you might have signs of cardiovascular disease, try using the Ada app to find out more about your symptoms.",Cardiovascular disease risk factors (heart disease risk factors),Cardiovascular disease risk factors can be classified as modifiable or non-modifiable.,"Non-modifiable cardiovascular disease risk factors are those that cannot be changed. These include a person’s age, ethnicity and family history (genetics cannot be changed), among other factors.","Modifiable cardiovascular disease risk factors are those that can be reduced or controlled with altered behavior. By making certain lifestyle changes, people are able to lower their chances of developing cardiovascular disease. Examples include smoking, diet and exercise.",Family history,"There is a genetic element to cardiovascular disease, meaning a family history of the condition is considered to be a risk factor. Generally, this applies if a person’s first-degree relative developed CVD at what may be considered a relatively young age. This is the case if the person’s father or brother developed cardiovascular disease before the age of 55, or their mother or sister developed it before the age of 65.[4][5]","A family history of high blood pressure (hypertension), high cholesterol and type 2 diabetes can also increase one’s chances of developing these conditions, which can in turn increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.","Having a family history of heart disease does not mean CVD is inevitable, but does make it more likely. Leading a healthy lifestyle is generally recommended to help reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in those with a genetic predisposition to the condition.",Age,"Older people are at greater risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Although the process of aging cannot be changed, leading a generally healthy lifestyle is recommended to help reduce the likelihood of developing heart and circulatory conditions.",Ethnicity,"Statistics suggest that people of South Asian, African or Caribbean descent have a greater risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Type 2 diabetes – a risk factor in itself for cardiovascular disease – also seems to be more prevalent among these groups. The reasons for this are difficult to define. However, leading a healthy lifestyle is generally recommended as a way for people from all backgrounds to help prevent heart and circulatory disease from developing.[6][^13]",Sex,"While it may have long been seen as a man’s disease, the risk of cardiovascular disease in women has been underestimated, and symptoms may go unrecognized, complicating diagnosis and treatment. Though CVD risk factors are shared by men and women, some may be more prevalent and/or more significant for one sex or gender; for example, having diabetes may be a stronger risk for certain types of CVD in women. Research is ongoing.[7][8][9][10]",Women tend to develop cardiovascular disease at an older age than men. This later age of onset in women is thought to be linked to the hormonal changes that follow menopause.[7][8][9][10],"If you are concerned about your cardiovascular disease risk profile, it is advisable to consult a doctor, who should be able to answer any questions you may have.",Socioeconomic status,"People who have a low socioeconomic status seem to be at a greater risk of cardiovascular disease. Although the reasons behind this are multiple and their relationships complex, diet is generally considered to be one of the biggest factors, with those from a higher socioeconomic background typically having greater access to a more nutritionally-balanced diet.[11]",Cholesterol,"High levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol – also known as “bad cholesterol” – are linked to a range of cardiovascular diseases. Cholesterol is a fatty substance that is carried around the body by proteins. If too much LDL cholesterol is present, it can cause fatty substances to build up in the artery walls and lead to complications.","High levels of LDL cholesterol are often caused by factors such as an unhealthy diet, smoking, physical inactivity, high alcohol intake and liver and kidney disease. To reduce LDL cholesterol levels, people can eat a balanced diet, undertake regular exercise and quit smoking. Those with extremely high levels of LDL cholesterol may be prescribed medication to lower them, most often statins.","Good to know: High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol is known as “good cholesterol”. This cholesterol transports cholesterol and fats from around the body to the liver, where they can be removed. Unlike LDL, it is generally a good thing to have a high level of HDL, as this can help lower one’s risk of developing heart disease or having a stroke. Eating healthily, staying active, avoiding tobacco and limiting alcohol intake can all help to increase HDL cholesterol levels.[12]",Blood pressure (hypertension),"High blood pressure, known as hypertension, is another contributing factor to cardiovascular disease, including heart failure, stroke and heart attack. High blood pressure is often symptomless, but can be easily diagnosed by a doctor, using a routine test.","High blood pressure is often linked to being overweight, physical inactivity, a high intake of salt or alcohol or a family history of the disorder, but in some cases may have no apparent cause. Lifestyle changes may help to reduce high blood pressure and, in severe cases, medication may be prescribed.[13]",Diabetes,"Having diabetes, a condition that causes high levels of glucose in the blood, is a risk factor for developing cardiovascular disease. High glucose levels can damage the artery walls and make the buildup of fatty deposits (atheroma) more likely. If these fatty deposits occur in the coronary arteries, they can lead to possible coronary heart disease and heart attack.","There are two types of diabetes: type 1, which involves the body being unable to produce insulin and which usually develops in children and young adults, and type 2 diabetes, which is more likely to affect older people, though is becoming more common in younger people, and which involves the body either not making enough insulin or the body becoming resistant to insulin. Type 2 diabetes is closely associated with a lifestyle that leads to being overweight and physical inactivity.","Eating a balanced diet, taking regular exercise and leading a generally healthy lifestyle can both help manage diabetes in those who already have the condition and help prevent the onset of the condition in those that don’t. In people with diabetes, careful management of blood sugar levels is also very important in helping to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.[14]",Smoking,"Smoking tobacco significantly increases the chance of developing cardiovascular disease. Smoking damages and narrows the arteries, making angina pectoris and heart attack more likely. Angina pectoris is a condition characterized by pain or discomfort in the center of the chest, caused by the heart muscle not getting enough blood,[15][16]. Nicotine also makes the heart beat faster and increases blood pressure, meaning the heart has to work harder to pump blood around the body.[17]","Soon after quitting smoking, health benefits such as improved circulation, better taste and smell and a stronger immune system can usually be noticed. Doctors and other health professionals are able to offer advice on how to quit smoking.[18][19]",Physical inactivity,"Physical inactivity is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Not exercising regularly increases a person’s chances of being overweight, of having high blood pressure and of developing other conditions that make cardiovascular disease more likely.[20]","To see substantial health benefits, experts recommend that adults do at least 150 minutes of moderate to high-intensity exercise per week. If this is not possible, any amount of physical activity is always preferable to none at all.[21]",Being overweight (obesity),"Being overweight is another leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Eating an unhealthy diet and being physically inactive are both contributing factors to being overweight, which is generally defined as having a body mass index (BMI) outside the normal range.[22]","Taking steps to lose weight through lifestyle and dietary changes can help reduce the risk of a range of cardiovascular conditions, including coronary heart disease and congestive heart failure.",Diet,"Eating an unhealthy diet is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease. To lower the risk, a balanced diet made up of plenty of fruits and vegetables, complex carbohydrates and protein should be aimed at and excess fats, salts and sugars avoided.","Alcohol should also be consumed in moderation, if at all. In many countries, this is defined as a maximum of 14 units of alcohol per week, with some experts recommending half that for women. The week should include several alcohol-free days. One unit is equal to approximately one small glass of beer or wine, or one “shot” of distilled spirits or liquor, e.g. whisky, gin.[23][24][25]",Cardiovascular disease risk factors FAQs,"**Q: What are heart disease risk factors?

A: The link between stress and cardiovascular disease is not well understood.  However, it is known that stress can influence many of the well-established risk factors for CVD, including high blood pressure, smoking, lack of exercise, eating an unhealthy diet and drinking large amounts of alcohol. In addition, it is thought that stress in the form of job strain and long working hours may somewhat increase a person’s risk of cardiovascular disease.[26][27][28][29]","**Q: Where can I do a CVD risk factor assessment or screening?
A: While various cardiovascular disease risk factor calculators and assessment tools exist online, the only way to obtain an accurate understanding of a particular person’s risk is by seeing a licensed doctor.","**Q: How can I reduce heart disease risk factors?

,,,,,,,,,,What is carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS)?
,,,,,,,,,,What is carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS)?,Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a painful medical condition in which the median nerve in the wrist becomes compressed inside the carpal tunnel.[1],"
The median nerve is a nerve which passes through the arm to the hand, on each side of the body and which controls sensation and movement in the hand.
The carpal tunnel is a narrow passageway in the wrist on the palm side of the hand, made up of bones and ligaments. The median nerve is the only nerve in the body which passes through the carpal tunnel.
","When direct pressure is exerted on a nerve, as in CTS, this is, in medical terms, referred to  as an entrapment neuropathy. CTS is the most common type of entrapment neuropathy.[2] When the nerve becomes entrapped, this causes symptoms including pain, tingling, numbness and hot-and-cold sensations. The hand may become difficult to move. The symptoms of CTS are often worst at night and absent during the day.","In most cases, the exact cause of CTS is unknown, but it usually develops in adulthood and is often attributed to work-related activities such as typing and other repetitive movements, such as mopping, sweeping or using vibrating tools. The risk of CTS is increased in people experiencing arthritis, thyroid conditions and pregnancy.","Around 60 percent of people affected by CTS experience the condition in both wrists (bilateral CTS). CTS which only affects one wrist is called unilateral CTS. In both bilateral and unilateral CTS, the dominant hand is usually first and/or more strongly, affected.[3]","CTS  caused by pregnancy often goes away on its own when the pregnancy concludes. Likewise, CTS that is caused by a medical condition usually goes away on its own when the condition is managed effectively.","To treat CTS, some people may find it helpful to wear a wrist splint at night to hold the wrist in a still position and use OTC or prescription medications to manage the pain and inflammation of CTS. For others, surgery may be necessary to alleviate the condition.",Symptoms,"The symptoms of CTS are usually worse at night and may be absent during the day. They can be intensified or brought on by forceful activities involving the wrist, especially the use of vibrating tools and heavy lifting. The most common symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome are:[4]","
Numbness and tingling in the thumb, index finger, middle finger and the radial half of the ring finger (the half of the ring finger closest to the palm, which is supplied by the median nerve). This can result in atrophy of the affected muscles (which may appear flattened).
Burning pain in the wrist
Loss of grip strength and dexterity
","Proximal radiation (the sensation that the pain has radiated to nearby areas) is a less common, but not unusual, symptom of CTS. People may experience pain related to CTS in other parts of the arm, namely:","
The volar forearm; the side of the forearm that is on the same side as the palm of the hand
The medial arm; the skin on the side of the arm where the medial brachial cutaneous nerve is
The shoulder
","The symptoms of CTS worsen the longer the condition is left untreated. If a person is affected by CTS for several months, they may begin to feel numbness in the hand on a permanent basis and lose the ability to feel hot and cold sensations with the hand.","Seek medical attention promptly if any of the symptoms of CTS are present, in order to diagnose and begin treating the condition  at an early stage.",Acute carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS),"Acute carpal tunnel syndrome is a version of CTS in which the median nerve is severely crushed, usually as the result of an injury or chronic health condition. Unlike regular CTS, acute CTS requires urgent surgical intervention to prevent serious health consequences, such as the permanent loss of sensation or movement in the affected area.[5]",Factors which are associated with the development of acute CTS include:[5],"
Fractures and fracture dislocations around the wrist
Vascular disorders (diseases affecting the blood vessels)
Hemorrhagic conditions (conditions relating to abnormal blood flow or clotting)
Rheumatologic disorders (conditions relating to pain and stiffness in the body, such as arthritis and Crohn’s disease)
Anomalous anatomy (atypical wrist or nerve structure)
",Causes of CTS,"Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by the median nerve (the nerve which controls sensation and movement in the hands) becoming compressed. Any medical conditions and/or injuries which cause swelling in the wrist can reduce the amount of space inside the carpal tunnel, causing pressure to be exerted on the median nerve and activating the symptoms of CTS.",The biological cause of CTS within the carpal tunnel is the swelling of a protective lining of tendons called the tenosynovium. This sets off a chain of related changes within the carpal tunnel:[6],"
The swelling of the tendons is understood to cause a buildup of synovial fluid; the fluid which normally protects and lubricates the tendons; within the carpal tunnel.
In reaction to this buildup of fluid, a band across the top of the carpal tunnel called the transverse ligament becomes thicker and broader.
The swelling and the enlarged transverse ligament exert pressure on the median nerve, depriving it of the blood supply and oxygen it needs in order to function normally. This causes the median nerve to become damaged and the symptoms of CTS to develop.
","The medical or circumstantial basis for these developments occurring in the carpal tunnel is unknown in many cases, and there is no test available to identify a specific cause. However, the development of CTS may be caused by factors including:[1]",Work-related activities,"In particular, CTS may be attributed to activities which involve repetitive movements, heavy lifting and using vibrating tools. Professional activities which are particularly associated with CTS include assembly work, farming, sewing, cleaning, and meat packing.",Heredity,People born with smaller bone structures are more likely to have wrist and bone structures in which the median nerve is susceptible to the compression that causes CTS. A genetic predisposition to any of the many medical conditions which are linked to CTS may be described as the indirect cause of CTS in a person who develops CTS as a result of another medical condition.[7],Medical conditions,"Musculoskeletal disorders (conditions affecting the muscles and/or skeleton) and autoimmune diseases may trigger the development of CTS by causing inflammation in the hands and wrists. The main medical conditions which are linked to CTS are diseases of the thyroid gland, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic kidney insufficiency, Down syndrome, osteoarthritis and obesity. If CTS is caused by a medical condition, it may be alleviated by effectively treating the causal condition.[6] Feeling unwell? Get a free symptom assessment by downloading the Ada app.",Pregnancy,"Pregnant women sometimes develop CTS due to hormonal changes and fluid retention. If CTS is caused by pregnancy alone, it will often go away when the pregnancy ends. Rest, ice, elevation and exercise may all help to alleviate the symptoms of CTS during pregnancy.[8]",Medications,"The use of some medications has been linked to CTS, but more research is needed to understand the mechanisms by which these may cause CTS to develop. Medications which have been linked to CTS include:[6]","
Medications which affect the immune system (such as interleukin-2)
Medications which prevent blood clotting (such as warfarin)
",Risk factors,"Certain risk factors increase a person’s likelihood of developing CTS. These include occupational factors such as working in a role that necessitates intensive and/or repetitive use of one’s hands, and non-occupational factors, such as medical conditions like diabetes and hypothyroidism which may cause CTS.",Risk factors for CTS include:[2],Pregnancy,"CTS is a common complication of pregnancy, due to fluid retention, edema and hormonal changes within the body. One’s likelihood of developing CTS in pregnancy, and the severity of the condition, increases with age. Most people who develop CTS during pregnancy find that it alleviates on its own when the pregnancy concludes.","Read more about Pregnancy »
Read more about Pregnacy Complications »",Being female,"According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, women are three times more likely than men to develop CTS.[1]",Menopause,"The hormonal changes that accompany menopause can cause a buildup of fluid in the body, increasing the risk of developing CTS. Women, whose hormone levels alter excessively during pregnancy, are more likely to develop CTS in later life, after undergoing menopause, than those whose hormonal changes during pregnancy are within the normal range.[9]",Inflammatory arthritis,"CTS is a common complication of arthritis, due to the swelling of joints and tendons associated with the condition.[10]",Being middle-aged or elderly,"The likelihood of developing CTS increases with age, particularly after 70. In part, this is due to the fact that most musculoskeletal disorders predominantly affect older people, and CTS is a common consequence of these conditions.[11]",Diabetes,"Between 15 and 20 percent of people with diabetes will develop CTS, which is believed to be due to having high blood sugar levels. Diabetes is often linked to the development of problems with the nerves, such as diabetic neuropathy. In people with diabetes, when blood sugar levels are high, glucose is believed to attach to the tendons. This causes compression within the carpal tunnel as the tendons enlarge, resulting in CTS.[12]",Read more about Diabetes »,Diseases of the thyroid,"People with improperly-managed thyroid conditions may retain excess fluid in their connective tissues. This contributes to inflammation within the wrist, which can cause CTS, especially if left untreated. Hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid) is particularly linked to CTS, but people with hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid) are also more likely to develop CTS than the general population.[13]","Read more about Hypothyroidism »
Read more about Hyperthyroidusm »",Heredity,"People with a sibling or parent with CTS are more likely to be affected than those without. A person’s bone structure and overall size is largely determined by their genetic makeup, and those with smaller frames have less space in their carpal tunnels, which significantly increases the likelihood of the median nerve becoming trapped and their developing CTS.[7]",Using tobacco products,"A link has been found between the use of tobacco and developing CTS. Tobacco products negatively affects the body’s immune system and increases a person’s risk of developing inflammatory diseases which can cause a buildup of fluid in the carpal tunnel, which may result in CTS.[14]",Injuries to the wrist,"It is possible for the median nerve to become compressed due to changes in the structure of the bones and muscles in the wrist that result from injuries. People who play a lot of sports are particularly at risk of hand and wrist injuries that can result in CTS. In injury-related CTS, ensuring that the injury heals properly and that the median nerve ceases to be entrapped will alleviate the condition.[15]",Working intensely with one’s hands,"CTS is often linked to activities involving repetitive hand and wrist movements, in particular, the use of vibrating tools.",Diagnosis,"To diagnose CTS, a doctor will usually perform a physical exam on the hand(s) and wrist(s) and ask about the symptoms a person has been experiencing. The purpose of the physical exam is to find out whether a person is experiencing physical sensations that typically relate to the median nerve being compressed.","If these sensations are not present, this can rule out a diagnosis of CTS and the possibility that a person is affected by another condition can be investigated. During the physical exam, doctors look out for:","
Weak muscles surrounding the thumb (which can happen in cases of CTS due to underusing these muscles in order to avoid the pain that often accompanies movement)
Tinel’s sign which involves tingling and numbness in the fingers when the wrist is tapped at the palm side of the hand (this alone is insufficient for a CTS diagnosis, as it is also a possible symptom of many other conditions)
A positive Phalen’s maneuver which invilves pain, numbness or tingling in the wrist and fingers when the wrist is flexed to the hand’s maximum ability
",Further testing,"Further testing is usually needed, even if all of these symptoms are present, in order to confirm a diagnosis of CTS. This may involve:",Nerve conduction test,"Damaged nerves cannot transmit signals to the body parts in order to bring about certain actions as quickly as healthy nerves can. Nerve damage is a common result of CTS. To detect it, the doctor will attach electrodes to the hand and wrist to stimulate the nerves in the fingers and wrist with an electric current.","The speed with which the signal can travel through the nerves will be indicative of the extent of any nerve damage, and can support or discredit a diagnosis of CTS. This test usually takes around 10 minutes to perform, and can be moderately uncomfortable because it produces an unfamiliar tapping/tingling sensation.",Imaging study,"Doctors may perform an ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan in order to visualize the median nerve and carpal tunnel and determine their exact positions and the extent of the nerve entrapment.",Blood testing,"To rule out other conditions which also have symptoms of pain, numbness and tingling in the hand/wrist, including diabetes, diseases of the thyroid and arthritis, doctors may perform a blood test.",Other conditions which may be misdiagnosed as CTS,"Carpal tunnel syndrome is frequently misdiagnosed due to the fact that it shares symptoms with several other conditions, including arthritis, wrist tendonitis, repetitive strain injury (RSI) and thoracic outlet syndrome. Symptoms which CTS shares with other conditions include:","
Tingling
Pain
Numbness
Hot-and-cold sensations
Difficulty grasping or using one’s hand
","It is important to be aware of the key differences between CTS and some other conditions which share its symptoms, in order to avoid a misdiagnosis. Other conditions which are commonly misdiagnosed as CTS include:",Arthritis,"Arthritis can affect all the fingers in the hand, whereas CTS cannot affect the little (pinky) finger. Whereas CTS is worse at night, arthritis is not affected by the time of day. The symptoms of CTS can be absent and then suddenly become triggered by a particular activity, whereas the pain associated with arthritis is usually constantly present but alters in intensity during activities which put strain on the hands and wrists.[16]",Read more about Arthritis »,Nerve compression due to conditions affecting the spine,"Conditions such as spinal disc herniation (a slipped disc) and cervical stenosis (a condition characterised by weakness and numbness that may affect areas including the spine, neck, shoulders, hands, arms and legs) can cause nerve compression that may result in similar sensations to those of CTS.",Wrist tendonitis,"In wrist tendonitis, the area affected by symptoms may be different to that of CTS. The pain, numbness and tingling may affect the tendons in any part of the hand or wrist, whereas in CTS the symptoms are limited to the thumb, index and middle fingers, the palm side of the wrist and the radial half of the ring finger.",Thoracic outlet syndrome,"In thoracic outlet syndrome, blood vessels or nerves in the space between the collarbone and the first rib become compressed. The pain can affect the shoulders and neck, as well as the fingers. The fingers which are usually affected are the little (pinky) finger and the non-radial half of the ring finger. These are the two areas that cannot be affected by the symptoms of CTS.[17]",Repetitive strain injury (RSI),"This is a general term to describe symptoms including pain, throbbing and stiffness in the muscles and tendons as a result of overuse and repetitive movements.[18] RSI can occur anywhere in the body, but most often affects the neck, shoulders, forearms, elbows, hands and wrists. When it occurs in the hand and wrists, RSI may be mistaken for CTS, but unlike CTS, RSI is capable of affecting any part of the overall area.",Treatment of CTS,"Carpal tunnel syndrome may disappear on its own without treatment. If CTS is caused by another condition such as arthritis or an underactive thyroid, its symptoms may alleviate on their own when the causal condition is treated.","If one’s carpal tunnel syndrome is not caused by another treatable medical condition, it is best to begin treatment as soon as possible to prevent the symptoms worsening and to reduce the level of damage to the median nerve associated with continuous pressure.","For those with mild symptoms, and/or who have been affected for a short time, non-surgical treatments such as wrist splinting and medications may be sufficient. In more severe cases, or where the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome cannot be alleviated by non-surgical means, surgery to relieve pressure on the median nerve may be recommended.","In pregnant women, the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome often abate in the weeks after the pregnancy ends, with no need for treatment. Those who are still experiencing symptoms of CTS three months after the conclusion of the pregnancy should seek medical attention to devise a treatment plan.[19]",Wrist splinting,"Wrist splinting is a common first-line treatment for mild to moderate CTS. It involves wearing a splint at night for a few weeks in order to hold the joint in a neutral position. This helps to prevent the symptoms of CTS from developing overnight, when the pain is usually worse.","Wrist splints come in many different shapes and sizes and a doctor can recommend a suitable one. A wrist splint works by preventing the hand from bending in way which brings on the symptoms of CTS during the night. However, because the wrist is kept in a fixed position by the splint, it is important to exercise the hand and wrist during the day to prevent the muscles from weakening due to underuse.","The effects of wrist splinting usually become noticeable after a few weeks of wearing the splint. In some cases, this is a sufficient treatment for CTS and symptoms will disappear.","However, for many people, splinting is a temporary solution rather than an effective treatment for CTS, and symptoms may return. In this case, other treatment options such as medications or surgery may be recommended.[20]",Medications for CTS,"Medications that are prescribed in the management of CTS can provide temporary relief from the pain and inflammation associated with the condition. The medications most commonly prescribed for CTS are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as ibuprofen and, in more severe cases of CTS, corticosteroids, which are taken as tablets or injected into the carpal tunnel.","NSAIDs are available as over-the-counter or prescription medication, and can temporarily minimize joint and muscle pain. Naproxen and ibuprofen are the NSAIDs most commonly used for pain management in CTS. Long-term use of NSAIDs carries multiple health risks, including impaired gastroenteric function and increased likelihood of peptic ulcer disease. NSAIDs should be taken for a limited period of time only, in consultation with a medical professional.","Corticosteroids can be taken orally as tablets or injected into the carpal tunnel. Local injections are considered to be more effective than oral corticosteroids at reducing the pain and inflammation associated with CTS. Corticosteroids may be prescribed in cases of severe CTS, and/or when wrist splinting has not provided long-term relief.[21]","Short-term use of corticosteroids (for example, for a few weeks or a month) is associated with a variety of side effects, including stomach problems, skin problems and weight gain, which may render them an unsuitable treatment option for some people.",Continuous (longer-term) use of corticosteroids is never recommended for the treatment of CTS as it is associated with increased risk of the development or worsening of a variety of health conditions such as diabetes and osteoporosis.,"Medications help manage the painful symptoms of CTS, rather than treating the cause. Neither NSAIDs nor corticosteroids can relieve the pressure on the median nerve and these medications can therefore only provide temporary relief from the symptoms of CTS. Medications should be used as part of a wider treatment strategy which focuses on releasing the entrapped median nerve.",Surgery,"Surgery for CTS will not usually be considered as a first-line treatment, and is usually recommended only when CTS is at a late stage and/or has not been alleviated by non-surgical treatments. Urgent surgery for CTS is usually only needed as a treatment for acute CTS.",Surgery for CTS involves cutting a part of the carpal tunnel in order to reduce pressure on the median nerve. The part of the carpal tunnel which is cut during surgery is known as the flexor retinaculum. There are two possible surgical procedures for CTS: endoscopic carpal tunnel release and open carpal tunnel release.[22],Both types of surgery can be performed as an outpatient procedure and usually only require a local anesthetic to numb the hand or arm.,"Endoscopic carpal tunnel release involves making a small incision in the palm and/or the wrist, and a small camera called an endoscope is inserted into one of the incisions to monitor the procedure. The flexor retinaculum is then cut with an instrument inserted into the second incision. It is also possible to perform the procedure by making only one incision in the wrist, and inserting both the surgical instrument and the endoscope into the same incision.",Open carpal tunnel release involves cuting the inside of the wrist to reveal the carpal tunnel. The surgeon will then cut through the flexor retinaculum.,"The recovery time may be slightly shorter for an endoscopic procedure, but most people can return to work less than three weeks after either procedure.[23]",Self-care for managing CTS,"If a person is diagnosed with CTS, they can help to prevent the condition getting worse by making certain adaptations to their lifestyle. The two principal lifestyle changes which are recommended for people who have been diagnosed with CTS are:",Exercising the hands and wrists,"There are many possible hand exercises that can be incorporated into a person’s daily routine in order to ease the pain associated with CTS and prevent future injuries.[24] When a person is diagnosed with CTS, doctors will be able to recommend and demonstrate exercises, and provide guidelines on how often these should be carried out.",Avoiding strain,"CTS can be aggravated by overuse of the hands and wrists, in particular through repetitive activities such as working in an assembly line or using vibrating tools. People with CTS whose work involves activities that may increase their symptoms are often advised to stay home when they are undergoing treatment to ensure its effectiveness. Wearing a wrist splint at night can help to reduce strain.[20]",Prevention,"It is not always possible to prevent CTS, particularly if it is caused by pregnancy or another health condition. However, there are some lifestyle changes that people can make to reduce the likelihood of developing CTS. These preventative measures are particularly recommended for people whose daily activities are associated with a higher risk of CTS.",Preventative measures against developing CTS include:,"
Ensuring that any other health conditions a person may have that could contribute to developing CTS (such as diabetes) are treated or managed effectively
Maintaining a healthy weight, diet and exercise regime
Avoiding the use of tobacco products, which weaken the immune system and increases the likelihood of developing inflammatory conditions that can cause CTS
Regularly assessing one’s day-to-day routine in order to minimize activities involving repetitive or intense movements that might contribute to an increased risk of CTS
Following ergonomic guidelines (recommendations on how to position and use equipment for efficiency and comfort) at home and at work, in order to ensure that all activities are carried out in the most comfortable, appropriate way for the body
Taking regular breaks from any activities that contribute to CTS, especially when using vibrating tools, in order to reduce the impact of activities which put pressure on the wrists and hands
",Carpal tunnel syndrome FAQs,"Q: Does typing cause CTS?
A: Typing is associated with an increased likelihood of developing repetitive strain injury (RSI). If RSI affects the tendons or ligaments in the carpal tunnel, this can cause compression on the median nerve and the development of CTS. However, research has shown that there is at most a very small direct link between computer work and CTS. Activities which involve using the hands and wrists with a greater intensity, such as using vibrating tools, are significantly more likely to cause CTS than typing. The use of ergonomic computer keyboards is, however, sometimes recommended as a preventative measure against developing CTS.[20]","Q: Can children be affected by CTS?
A: CTS in children is rare. When it develops, it is most commonly related to having a genetically inherited condition associated with inflammation, such as lysosomal storage disease, which can cause swelling in the joints and pressure to build up in the carpal tunnel. The symptoms of CTS and its treatment options are the same for children as for adults.[25] If you are concerned that your child, or a child that you know, may be affected by CTS, you can get a free symptom assessment by downloading the Ada app."
,,,,,,,,,,What are cataracts?
,,,,,,,,,,What are cataracts?,"A cataract is a clouding of the eye’s lens which leads to a decrease in vision and, in some cases, possible blindness. The condition occurs when protein clumps in one or both eyes prevent the retina from receiving clear images.[1] Cataracts generally affect older people, but can also be present from birth, be brought about by exposure to radiation or trauma, as well as through complications from surgery.[2]","Cataracts are among the main causes of blindness globally and are one of the most common reasons for loss of vision in people over 40.[3] Cataracts can be treated through surgery, and steps can be taken to help prevent the onset of the disorder.",Types of cataracts,"There are several types of cataracts, each classified by how and where they develop in the eye:[4]","
Nuclear cataracts form in the center (nucleus) of the lens and typically cause the eye to become brown or yellow. Normally associated with aging.
Posterior capsular cataracts affect the back of the eye and typically form very quickly.
Cortical cataracts form in the lens cortex which surrounds the nucleus. They are white and wedge-shaped opacities.
Congenital cataracts are a rare form that develops in childhood or are present at birth.
Radiation cataracts are brought about by exposure to radiation, typically as a result of cancer treatment.
Traumatic cataracts are brought about by damage to the eyes and can sometimes develop some time after the initial trauma.
Secondary cataracts are a result of medications or disease. These include the steroid prednisone, diabetes, and glaucoma.
",Symptoms of cataracts,"Cataracts typically develop slowly, meaning the symptoms may be difficult to detect or confused with normal signs of aging. The symptoms include:","
Blurred, clouded or dimmed vision
Sensitivity to light and glare, particularly at night
Objects appear yellow-tinged or faded in color
Halos appearing around lights
Changes in glasses prescription
","Occasionally, when cataracts first develop, it can lead to an improvement in nearsightedness. This phenomenon is known as “second sight” and is a temporary occurrence that will disappear as the condition develops.[5]",Causes of cataracts,"The lens of the eye filters light onto the retina, allowing for clear and focussed vision. Largely, it is made from water and proteins. Cataracts are brought about when these proteins begin to clump in the lens, leading to blurred, faded and cloudy vision which can worsen over time. This clumping is commonly a result of aging, yet it is not clear why some people and not others are affected.","There are, however, some factors that may increase an individual’s chances of developing cataracts, including:[6]","
Exposure to ultraviolet radiation, from sunlight or radiation therapy
Diabetes
Eye conditions like uveitis and glaucoma
Eye injury or surgery
Use of corticosteroids
A family history of cataracts
",Other factors that are also thought to be linked to the development of cataracts include:,"
Smoking
Alcohol
The abuse of illicit substances
Vitamin deficiency. See these resources on vitamin D deficiency, vitamin K deficiency and vitamin B12 deficiency for more information.
",Diagnosing cataracts,"Cataracts are diagnosed through a full eye examination carried out by an optometrist or ophthalmologist. Those experiencing problems with their sight should visit an eye care professional as soon as possible. Moreover, people over 40 should undergo an eye test at least once every two years.[7]",Cataracts treatment,"If the symptoms of cataracts are mild, an altered prescription, i.e. for different glasses or contact lenses, may be effective in correcting an individual’s vision. However, it is typical for cataracts to worsen over time. If this happens, it is likely that surgery will be necessary.[8]","Cataracts surgery is a common procedure and usually carried out under local anaesthetic. Most people who undergo cataract surgery will see a significant improvement in their vision, with 9 out of 10 people achieving between 20/20 and 20/40 vision afterwards. However, most surgeons will focus on correcting long-distance sight, meaning glasses may still be needed to see things close at hand.",Good to know: The terms 20/20 and 20/40 are visual acuity measurements.,This is usually measured using the Snellen visual acuity system:,"
The top number of the fraction refers to the viewing distance between the patient and the eye chart.
The bottom number of the fraction refers to the distance at which a person with ideal vision would be able to see the figures on the eye chart clearly.
","A person with 20/40 vision can therefore see figures on the eye chart clearly at a distance of 20 feet, whereas a person with ideal vision could see the same figures clearly, from a distance of 40 feet away from the eye chart.","In the United States, the distance at which visual acuity is measured, is typically 20 feet. In other countries, this distance is generally six meters, and a person’s visual acuity may therefore be expressed as a fraction of six.",Risks,"The risk of complications during and after cataract surgery is small. The most common complication is posterior capsule opacification (PCO) brought about when skin or membrane grows over the implanted lens, resulting in a return of clouded or impaired vision. PCO can be corrected with laser surgery.[8]",There are other risks that are far less common. Risks during the operation include:,"
Tearing of the lens
Inability to remove the cataracts
Bleeding of the eye
Accidental damage to other areas of the eye
",Risks following the operation include:,"
Inflammation of the eye
Retina swelling
Cornea swelling
Retinal detachment
Infection
","If complications become apparent after surgery, a doctor should be contacted as soon as possible. In most cases, complications can be rectified with treatment or further surgery.",Cataracts prevention,"Although there is no guaranteed way to prevent cataracts, there are some preventative measures that can be undertaken to reduce the risk. They include:[9]","
Having your eyes checked regularly
Eating a healthy diet rich in vitamins
Quitting or cutting down on smoking
Reducing your alcohol intake
Avoiding prolonged use of corticosteroids
",Cataracts FAQs,"Q: Is cataract extraction possible?
A: Yes, cataract extraction is carried out through surgery. The procedure is considered routine and is a success in most cases, leading to between 20/20 and 20/40 vision.[10]","Q: Do cataracts lead to blindness?
A: Cataracts cannot be reversed but it can be treated effectively through surgery. If, however, the condition is left untreated, it can lead to blindness."
,,,,,,,,,,What are the causes of miscarriage?
,,,,,,,,,,What are the causes of miscarriage?,"A miscarriage is a fairly common complication of early pregnancy, in which the developing embryo or fetus dies in the womb of natural causes, or due to exposure to substances, i.e. in certain medications, which are unsuitable for use during pregnancy. The term miscarriage is used to describe this process when it happens during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy:","
A miscarriage which occurs in the first trimester (weeks 1-12 of pregnancy) is known as an early miscarriage
A miscarriage which occurs in the second trimester (during weeks 13-20 of the pregnancy) is known as a late miscarriage
","Loss of the fetus which occurs after week 20 of pregnancy is known as a stillbirth, or fetal death.","Most miscarriages are early miscarriages, and are caused by factors including:[1][2]","
Chemical pregnancy, when the fertilized egg fails to implant in the uterine (womb) lining, and the pregnancy can only be evidenced by measuring levels of the pregnancy hormone, hCG, which will be detectable in blood or urine pregnancy tests. The embryo does not develop sufficiently to be visible on an ultrasound scan.
Chromosomal (DNA) abnormalities, which are present in the fetus.
Problems with the placenta, the organ responsible for the exchange of nutrients and gases between the pregnant person and the fetus.
","Certain long-term health conditions, particularly immunological disorders, such as diabetes or systemic lupus erythematosus, may cause early or late miscarriage. (See the section on miscarriage caused by long-term health conditions and immune disorders.)",The typical causes of late miscarriages tend to be different from the causes of early miscarriages. The leading causes of late miscarriage include:[2],"
Adverse reactions to medications
Diseases and infections, such as toxoplasmosis or rubella
Food poisoning
Environmental factors, such as exposure to radiation
Womb or cervical dysfunction
","More rarely, miscarriage can be caused by other factors, including histamine intolerance, fibroids or psychological stress.","It is also possible for a miscarriage to be caused by treatable conditions; for example, fertility issues affecting one or both parents. (See the section on diagnosing and treating causes of miscarriage.)",Age and miscarriage,"Being older increases the likelihood of miscarrying, in both the first and second trimesters. The older a person is, the more likely it becomes that their pregnancy will result in a miscarriage:[2]","
In women under 30, only 1 in 10 pregnancies end in miscarriage
In women over 45, more than half of all pregnancies end in miscarriage
","The older either parent is, the more likely it is that the developing fetus will be vulnerable to other causes of miscarriage, which renders age the leading cause of miscarriage overall. In particular, the risk of conceiving an embryo with chromosomal abnormalities, which may lead to miscarriage, increases with age.","The risk of miscarriage increases after the approximate age of 35 for women, and 40 for men. Notwithstanding the increased risk of miscarriage, it is possible to have a healthy pregnancy after these ages.",Chemical pregnancy,"In a chemical pregnancy, the fertilized egg fails to implant properly in the uterine (womb) lining and/or survive in the uterus. Miscarriages caused by chemical pregnancy occur very early in pregnancy, usually at around week five of pregnancy, before the fetal heartbeat would be detectable via an ultrasound scan.","It is possible for a person to be unaware of their chemical pregnancy and of miscarrying. Many early miscarriages go unnoticed because the symptoms of early miscarriage, such as abdominal pain and/or vaginal blood loss, are not usually severe. They may therefore be perceived as normal menstruation.","Good to know: Many forms of birth control (contraception), such as the combined pill or progesterone-only mini pill work to thin the lining of the womb. These medications are usually taken intentionally to prevent pregnancy. One way in which they do this is by stopping the fertilized egg from implanting. When a fertilized egg does not implant due to the effective use of birth control, this is not considered a chemical pregnancy.",Chromosomal abnormalities,"Chromosomal abnormalities are the most common cause of early miscarriage. They are detected in 50 to 85 percent of miscarried pregnancy tissue, which, as standard practice, is usually analyzed after a miscarriage takes place, to help determine the cause.[3]","Most people have 23 pairs of chromosomes. Chromosomes are basically blocks of DNA; the mechanism by which parents pass their genes onto their offspring, determining characteristics like hair and eye color and the possibility of carrying – or being affected by – hereditary diseases like sickle cell disease.","The male sex cell (sperm) and the female sex cell (egg) each carry 23 chromosomes. A normal fertilized egg (zygote) has 23 pairs of chromosomes and is equipped to develop into a healthy embryo, which in turn develops into a fetus as the pregnancy progresses. An embryo becomes a fetus at around eight weeks into the pregnancy, at which point all major body parts are present.","If an embryo has more or fewer than 23 pairs of chromosomes, this is a chromosomal abnormality and the zygote will be vulnerable to miscarriage, either during its embryo stage or when it develops into a fetus.","A multitude of potential problems stemming from chromosomal abnormalities can affect the embryo or fetus. It can take an unpredictable amount of time for an embryo or fetus to develop enough for it to become clear that, due to its chromosomal makeup, it would be unlikely to survive after birth. It is at this point, usually in the first trimester, that miscarriage will occur.",Types of chromosomal abnormalities which commonly lead to miscarriage include:[4],Blighted ovum,"Blighted ovum is a very common type of miscarriage which occurs early in pregnancy, usually in week 5-6. This is before the developing fetus would be visible on an ultrasound scan.","A blighted ovum miscarriage is caused by high levels of chromosome abnormalities in the fetus which would prevent any resultant baby from developing healthily. As a result, the fertilized egg does not develop into an embryo. Instead, a cluster of cells forms in the uterus to make an empty pregnancy sac. A blighted ovum often results in miscarriage before a person is aware that they had become pregnant.",Trisomy,"The fetus will contain one extra chromosome, so 47 chromosomes will be present in total, rather than the usual 46 (23 pairs). The chances of miscarriage in a case of trisomy are high. Trisomies that do not result in miscarriage are usually born with congenital conditions such as Down syndrome.",Nullisomy,The embryo will be missing a pair of chromosomes. Embryos with missing chromosomes cannot develop healthily and will result in miscarriage.,Monosomy,"A monosomy is a fetus in which one chromosome is missing. The fetus will contain 45 chromosomes: 22 pairs and a half. Monosomies almost always result in miscarriage. If a monosomy comes to term, the baby usually has a congenital condition and/or can only survive outside the womb for a short time.",Placental problems,"Problems with the placenta are frequently found to be the cause of miscarriage or stillbirth, especially early miscarriage. The placenta is an organ which develops in the uterus during pregnancy. It is pancake-shaped and should be positioned at the top of the uterus, as far away as possible from the cervix, i.e. the part connecting the womb to the vagina. After the baby is born, further contractions will typically push the placenta out through the vagina.","In its correct position, a healthy placenta performs important functions including:[5]","
Providing the developing fetus with oxygen and nutrients
Removing waste products from the fetus’ blood through the umbilical cord
Secreting the hormones necessary to maintain pregnancy
Passing on antibodies to protect the fetus from infection
","If the placenta does not form or function correctly throughout pregnancy, this is likely to negatively affect the development of the fetus, causing a miscarriage. Ways in which the placenta may cause miscarriage include:[6][7][8]","
Passing on toxins from alcohol, excess caffeine, unsuitable environments, medications that are unsuitable for use in pregnancy and illicit substances from the pregnant person to the pregnancy tissue and/or fetus.
Passing on harmful cells related to infections or inadequately managed long-term health conditions from the pregnant person to the pregnancy tissue and/or fetus.
Placental insufficiency, in which the placenta fails to pass sufficient hormones, antibodies, oxygen and nutrients to the developing baby. Placental insufficiency is particularly common when the placenta does not grow big enough to sustain the fetus. For example, this sometimes happens when it is sustaining twins rather than a single fetus.
",Medications which can cause miscarriage,"People who become pregnant may have an ongoing health condition, or develop a new condition, which requires continual treatment and/or management using certain over-the-counter (OTC) or prescription medications. Before using any medication, pregnant women should always confirm with a doctor that it is safe for use in pregnancy.","Physicians can advise on making changes to long-term medications which are needed and/or recommend appropriate new medications to use, to minimise the risks to both mother and baby.","In addition to needing medications for possible ongoing conditions and/or new conditions unrelated to the pregnancy itself, pregnancy can cause a person to be affected by certain related conditions such as severe morning sickness or headaches, mainly in the first trimester. These can usually be treated effectively and safely with appropriate OTC or prescription medications as recommended by a doctor.[9]","However, particular medications are unsuitable for pregnant women and using them can cause miscarriage or (teratogenic) abnormalities and/or malformations. The reason that certain medications may cause miscarriage is that, like food and drink consumed by the pregnant person, their components are transmitted by the placenta to the developing fetus. Pregnant women are not usually included in safety trials for new compounds, and therefore only a limited amount is known about whether medications are wholly safe for use during pregnancy.","To minimize the risk of a medication-induced miscarriage, doctors will:","
Prescribe only medications which are widely accepted to be safe for pregnant women and the developing fetus
Advise people to avoid medications which have been linked to pregnancy or birth complications and miscarriage
",Medications which are commonly linked to miscarriage include:[10][11],Ibuprofen,"An over-the-counter or prescription painkiller commonly used to treat fever inflammation and pain, ibuprofen is not recommended for use during pregnancy and can cause congenital defects as well as increase the risk of miscarriage.",Read more about Ibuprofen »,Isotretinoin,"Used to treat severe acne, this medication can cause congenital defects, most often affecting the baby’s heart and face, as well as increase the risk of miscarriage.

Many womb or cervical dysfunctions make miscarriage particularly likely to occur in the second trimester as the developing fetus grows in size. A weakened cervix, known as an impotent cervix, commonly causes miscarriage, as the cervical muscles dilate too early in the pregnancy. This often results in the early expulsion of the fetus from the womb, before it would be able to survive on its own.","Good to know: If medical professionals are aware that a pregnant person has a weakened cervix; e.g. because they have previously experienced a miscarriage for this reason, a temporary stitch may be put around the cervix to keep it closed. This procedure is usually performed during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy to prevent miscarriage, and is removed around week 37 in preparation for the birth.[2]",Other problems which may affect the pelvic area and cause miscarriage include the presence of non-cancerous growths in the womb (fibroids) and having a uterine form variation (an abnormally-shaped womb).

Many people with an arcuate womb opt for a Cesarean birth (C-section) as a result.",Bicornuate womb,"Also called a heart-shaped womb, this abnormality increases a person’s chances of a second-trimester miscarriage or premature birth. Additionally, while it does not usually cause any difficulties in conceiving or during early pregnancy, having a bicornuate womb may cause difficulties during the birth itself. These may be overcome by opting for a Cesarean.",Septate womb,"In a septate womb, a wall of muscle from the top to the bottom of the womb separates the womb into two vertical chambers. The wall of muscle may extend all or part of the way down the womb, creating a partial or total division. People with a septate womb will often have difficulty conceiving and are at greater risk of a first-trimester miscarriage or premature birth. A septate womb may cause the developing fetus to lie in an unusual position, resulting in birthing difficulties.",Unicornuate womb,"A unicornuate womb is a rare abnormality in which only one side of the uterus develops.

This can leave the fetus and placenta vulnerable to attack from the mother’s immune cells.","Good to know: The immune system works to protect the body from foreign cells (antigens) by destroying them in order to prevent the development or spread of disease or infection. Both the developing embryo and placenta contain antigens. In a healthy pregnancy, the genes that are responsible for recruiting immune cells are turned off within the decidua – the lining inside the uterus which forms during pregnancy.[25] The developing embryo and placenta are therefore protected from being destroyed by the immune system in the usual way, despite containing foreign cells.",Immunological abnormalities which may cause miscarriage can stem from the pregnant person being affected by factors including:[26],"

,,,,,,,,,,What is celiac disease?
,,,,,,,,,,What is celiac disease?,"Celiac disease is a serious, lifelong condition caused by the immune system reacting to gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye, barley and several other grains. It causes inflammation and damage in the small intestine and can result in a wide range of symptoms throughout the body.[1][2]",Symptoms of celiac disease in adults and children may include:[1][3][4],"
Abdominal (belly) pain or discomfort
Diarrhea
Fatty, pale, smelly stools that float in the toilet
Rash
Fatigue
Irritability and depression
","However, many people have no symptoms or only mild symptoms, which can make a timely diagnosis challenging. Celiac disease often goes unrecognized; only a small fraction of people with the condition are diagnosed.[5][4][2]","Celiac disease can affect anyone, of any age, though it tends to be more common among women than men. It occurs in approximately one out of every 100 people. There seem to be two peak periods in the appearance of symptoms - one in the first year of life, between eight and 12 months of age, and the second between approximately 20-40 years of age. Celiac disease is linked to certain genes and is often found to run in families.[1][3][6]","In people with celiac disease, eating food that contains gluten causes a severe response from the immune system; it mistakenly damages the lining of the small intestine, leading to difficulty absorbing nutrients and a number of potential complications.[1][4][2]","There is currently no cure or way to prevent celiac disease. The only treatment for celiac disease is a lifelong gluten-free diet. Following a strict gluten-free diet allows the lining of the small intestine to heal, clearing up symptoms and reducing the likelihood of developing complications. Any ingestion of gluten will result in damage to the intestine and a relapse of symptoms.[1][3][4][2]",Celiac disease symptoms,"The symptoms of celiac disease can vary widely and range from mild to severe. If present, they are typically persistent.",Gastrointestinal (digestive tract) symptoms in adults may include:[5][1][3][4][7],"

","Many adults with celiac disease do not have any symptoms, or only have mild symptoms.[4] People experiencing symptoms that may be linked to celiac disease can carry out a symptom assessment using the free Ada app now.",Causes of celiac disease,"Celiac disease is caused by a severe response to gluten, a type of protein found in wheat, barley, rye and several other grains. In some people who carry genes called HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8, eating foods containing gluten can trigger the body’s immune system to mistakenly damage the lining of the gut.[1] It is not understood exactly why this happens.[9]","Reacting to gluten, the immune system causes inflammation and irritation in the lining of the small intestine. The villi, which are tiny, tube-like projections in the lining and play a key role in the absorption of digested food, become flattened. This is called villous atrophy and can lead to malabsorption, with serious nutritional deficiencies and health complications as a result.[5][1][3][4][2]",Risk factors for celiac disease,"Celiac disease can affect anyone, of any age and racial background. However, certain factors may make a person more likely to develop celiac disease. These include:[1][4][8]","
Having a close relative, e.g. a parent or sibling, with celiac disease; this significantly increases one’s risk
Having another autoimmune condition, e.g. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, type 1 diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis
Turner syndrome, a disorder in which a female only has one out of two X chromosomes
Down syndrome, also known as trisomy 21
",Celiac disease and “leaky gut”,"The terms “leaky gut” and “leaky gut syndrome” are often encountered by people looking for information on celiac disease and/or gluten sensitivity. Leaky gut and leaky gut syndrome are not recognized medical terms. They refer to something known as intestinal permeability, which means the ease with which substances are able to move through the mucosal barrier, or wall, of the small intestine.[10][11][12][13]","In a healthy intestine, the gaps between cells in the mucosal barrier are usually very small, only allowing appropriately digested nutrients and other substances through to the bloodstream. However, certain substances and conditions can cause the gaps to widen or the intestinal barrier to become “loose” or “leaky”. Celiac disease is one such condition. It is thought that gluten may cause increased intestinal permeability in a number of people without celiac disease, too.[10][11][12][13]","There is a theory that increased intestinal permeability might allow potentially harmful substances, e.g. undigested proteins, bacteria and toxins, to pass from the gut into the bloodstream and cause widespread inflammation in the body, with a range of resulting health problems.[10][11][12][13]","There is not enough evidence to confirm many of the ideas about leaky gut and the possible effects it may have in the body. Doctors generally recommend eating a balanced, healthy diet for optimal digestive and overall health.[10][11][12]","If you have any questions about your digestive health, it is recommended that you consult a medical doctor.",Diagnosis of celiac disease,"After taking the person’s medical history and performing a physical examination, a doctor will typically order blood tests if celiac disease is suspected. If the results suggest that celiac disease is present, a biopsy will then be recommended to confirm the diagnosis.[1][4]","Good to know: If you think that you might have celiac disease, it is very important that you do not go gluten-free until you have spoken to a doctor and been tested, if necessary. Adopting a gluten-free diet can interfere with the blood test and biopsy results and may cause a false negative.[1][9]",Celiac disease blood test,"A blood test is used to check for the antibodies, proteins that typically fight infection and which are typical of celiac disease. These include IgA tissue transglutaminase (IgA tTG), endomysial IgA and IgG deamidated gliadin peptide. The levels of these antibodies are usually only high in people with celiac disease.[9] A doctor may also recommend blood tests to check for nutritional deficiencies, e.g. iron deficiency.[1]",Celiac disease biopsy,"If the blood test shows high levels of the antibodies found in celiac disease, a diagnosis will typically need to be confirmed with a biopsy of the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine. This involves a doctor taking a small sample of tissue, typically using an endoscope – a thin tube that is passed down the throat into the stomach and intestine. The sample is examined for signs of the characteristic damage caused by celiac disease.[1][9]",Genetic test for celiac disease,"In some cases, it may be possible to have a test to check for the presence of the genes that are associated with celiac disease. Not having HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 genes means that developing celiac disease is highly unlikely. However, having the genes does not mean that a person will develop celiac disease; the majority of people with a genetic predisposition to celiac disease never develop the condition.[14][15]",Celiac disease treatment,"There is currently no cure for celiac disease – treatment requires adopting a completely gluten-free diet. In addition, certain supplements and vaccinations may be recommended to help prevent complications from celiac disease.[5][1][4]",Gluten-free diet,"The only effective treatment for celiac disease is a diet that is 100 percent free of gluten. Following a strict gluten-free diet typically results in a rapid improvement in symptoms; a person will usually start to feel better within a couple of weeks, and the lining of the small intestine will start to heal.[5][1][3][4][2]",A strict gluten-free diet must be followed for life; the consumption of even a very small amount of gluten can cause damage to the small intestine and trigger a relapse of symptoms.[1],Gluten is found in the following grains:[5][1][3][4],"
Wheat
Rye
Barley
Spelt
Einkorn
Kamut
Triticale
","Any foods that contain the above, e.g. breads, pastries and many cereals, will therefore also contain gluten, and must be avoided. Sauces, snack foods, ready-made meals, beers and even medicines are among the many products that often contain gluten; labels should always be checked carefully.",Gluten is not found in the following unprocessed starches:,"
Rice
Potatoes
Corn
",Oats and celiac disease,"There are differing opinions on whether oats are suitable for people with celiac disease. Oats contain a protein called avenin, which is similar to gluten. For some people with celiac disease, this does not seem to be a problem. However, others find that it causes a relapse of symptoms and/or damage to the small intestine. Furthermore, some brands of oats may be contaminated with gluten from the factories they are processed in. Some celiac disease authorities advise that oats be included in a person’s diet, while others recommend avoiding all oats and oat products. A doctor may be able to advise on what is most appropriate for a particular person’s dietary needs.[16][8][17][18][19]","Good to know: It is possible to enjoy a balanced, healthy diet that does not contain any gluten. Fruit, vegetables, dairy, soya, eggs, fish and meat are all gluten-free, and gluten-free breads, snacks and other products are increasingly available. A doctor will be able to offer advice and/or refer a person to a dietician, support groups and information resources.",Other measures,A doctor may recommend the following measures to help prevent nutritional deficiencies and other complications from celiac disease:[1][20],"
Taking a vitamin, calcium or iron supplement, for at least six months after diagnosis
Having the seasonal “flu jab”, the yearly influenza vaccination
Having other vaccinations, e.g. the Hib vaccine to prevent blood poisoning and pneumonia, and the pneumococcal vaccine[21]
",Complications of celiac disease,Maintaining a strictly gluten-free diet is essential to prevent symptoms and lower the likelihood of complications from celiac disease. Eating even a tiny amount of gluten can cause symptoms and increase the risk of developing complications.[1],Complications associated with poorly managed celiac disease include:[5][1][9],"
Vitamin D deficiency, iron deficiency and other nutrient deficiencies
Osteoporosis
Skin problems, e.g. dermatitis herpetiformis
Ulcers in the intestine, known as ulcerative jejunitis
Weakened functioning of the spleen and possibly the immune system as a result[21]
Other autoimmune conditions, e.g. type 1 diabetes and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis
Anxiety and depression
Rarely, lymphoma, a cancer of the intestinal lymph system, and other cancers of the gastrointestinal tract[22]
Infertility
In undiagnosed women having a child, low birth weight, premature birth or miscarriage
In children, stunted growth, delayed puberty and dental problems
",Non-responsive celiac disease,"About one in 10 people with celiac disease will continue to experience symptoms after they have switched to a strict gluten-free diet. This is often caused by hidden sources of gluten in the diet, but may also be the result of:[5][9]","
Food intolerances, e.g. lactose, a sugar found in cow’s milk
Food allergies
Bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine
Irritable bowel syndrome
Microscopic colitis
A deficiency of pancreatic enzymes
Refractory celiac disease
",Refractory celiac disease,"A small number of people with celiac disease may continue to experience gastrointestinal symptoms even on a confirmed gluten-free diet, or experience short-term relief when going gluten-free and then a recurrence of symptoms. This is called refractory celiac disease. The cause is unknown, and the condition requires treatment with immunosuppressive medication, e.g. steroids.[9]",Prevention of celiac disease,"Previously, it was thought, by not introducing gluten into a baby’s diet until they were 4-6 months old, it might be possible to prevent or slow the development of celiac disease. However, recent research shows that the period at which gluten is first introduced does not affect the development of the condition. It is not yet possible to prevent celiac disease in children or adults.[23][24]","Nonetheless, early diagnosis and treatment can help to prevent further development of, and complications from, celiac disease. It is recommended that anyone who experiences symptoms, or could be considered to be at risk for the condition, ask a doctor about screening. For people who are diagnosed with celiac disease, following a strict gluten-free diet can help to prevent further damage to the digestive tract and other complications.[24]",Celiac disease in children,"Celiac disease can affect people of any age, including infants and children. If present, symptoms of celiac disease in children are typically persistent.",Gastrointestinal (digestive tract) symptoms in children may include:[25][26],"
Diarrhea or constipation

Thinning of the bones
Anxiety and/or irritability[28]
Sleep disturbances
","Many children with celiac disease do not have any symptoms, or only have mild symptoms.[4]","If a child is suspected of having celiac disease, a doctor will typically recommend blood tests before making any dietary changes and, if the result is positive, a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis.","Treatment for celiac disease in babies and children is the same for adults and requires a strictly gluten-free diet. While this may be challenging for the family, it is necessary at all times, without exception and must be continued for the rest of the person’s life to avoid complications. Support groups are available to assist families in adjusting to and managing a 100 percent gluten-free lifestyle.",Celiac disease FAQs,"Q: Is celiac disease genetic?
A: Yes. Celiac disease is said to be genetic, because it typically develops in people who carry genes called HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8. These genes are found in about 30 percent of people. However, not everyone who has these genes will develop celiac disease; only about one in every 30 people will develop the condition. It is triggered by a combination of genes and environmental factors. If a close relative has celiac disease, a person’s likelihood of developing it is higher, and screening may be recommended.[5][2][28]","Q: Is there a test for celiac disease?
A: Yes. There is a blood test that can detect the antibodies – proteins that typically fight infection – found in celiac disease. If the test is positive for these antibodies, diagnosis is typically confirmed with a biopsy, where a small sample of tissue is taken from the small intestine and checked in a laboratory.[1]","Q: What is the difference between celiac disease and gluten sensitivity?
A: Some people who do not have celiac disease may nonetheless experience similar symptoms when eating foods containing gluten, and they may feel better when they exclude gluten from their diet. This is called non-celiac gluten sensitivity, or simply gluten sensitivity.[14]","Q: What is the difference between celiac disease and a wheat allergy?
A: Celiac disease is a severe response to gluten, a type of protein which is found in wheat and many other grains. Eating foods containing gluten causes a long-term autoimmune reaction, where the body is attacked by its own immune system. Symptoms may not appear immediately. A wheat allergy, on the other hand, is an immediate, short-term reaction to proteins found in wheat specifically. Eating foods containing wheat or being exposed to wheat in other ways causes the immune system to try and attack these proteins as if they were invading germs. The immune system does not attack the body. The symptoms of celiac disease and wheat allergy are different.[29][30]","Q: Is there a celiac disease vaccine?
A: Not yet. A vaccine for celiac disease is currently being researched and tested in clinical trials to see whether it works and whether it is safe for people to receive. It is called Nexvax2® and aims to desensitize people with celiac disease to gluten, so that it no longer triggers an autoimmune response.[31][32]",Other names for celiac disease,"

Cervical cancer is a common cancer in women. Most cervical cancer is caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV or wart virus). This virus causes changes in the cervical cells that may develop into cancer over time. Symptoms may include unusual vaginal discharge, pain during sex and vaginal bleeding after sex, between periods or after the menopause. The treatment may consist of surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. If discovered at an early stage it is likely to be cured.",Risks,Cervical cancer is one of the most common cancers in women. Most cases are caused by infection with the human papilloma virus (HPV or wart virus). People who have unprotected sex or who first have sex at an early age are more likely to get HPV and develop cervical cancer.

Other things that increase the risk of cervical cancer are smoking and having a relative who has had cervical cancer.,Symptoms,"Symptoms include vaginal discharge, vaginal bleeding in between menstruation or after sex, pain during sex and pain in the lower part of the belly. Many women with cervical cancer have no symptoms, so screening (testing for the condition in people with no symptoms) is important.",Diagnosis,"The diagnosis may be based on screening for changes in cervical cells. Women are regularly screened (tested without symptoms) for cervical cancer, and the most common test for screening is a Pap smear. This test involves sampling cells from the cervix and looking at them under a microscope. If there are signs that a cancer could be developing, a biopsy (a bigger sample of the cervix) may be needed to identify the type of cancer.",Treatment,"If there are cells on the cervix that have a high chance of becoming a cancer over time, these are removed with a procedure called a large loop excision (of the) transformation zone (a LLETZ procedure). Treatment of cervical cancer depends on the size of the cancer, the exact type of cancer and whether the cancer has spread. The combination of these factors decides the stage of the cancer. Depending on the stage, cervical cancer can be treated by radiotherapy, surgery and chemotherapy or a combination of therapies. The treating doctor can give the best advice as to treatment.",Prevention,"Vaccination against the wart virus helps to prevent most cases of cervical cancer. This is currently given to girls between the ages of 9 and 14 as a part of national immunization programs. Screening (Pap tests) for cervical cancer is also very important because it allows cervical cancer to be detected and treated at an early stage.

A: Yes, in cases, where cervicitis is caused by chlamydia or  gonorrhea and it spreads to the uterus or fallopian tubes via mechanisms not yet fully understood, but probably related to various inflammatory processes in infections with trichomonas, or when pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), a related condition, develops.[9][10] If you are worried about the possibility of cervicitis complications, seeking immediate medical attention is advised. The Ada app can also be used to carry out a symptom assessment."
,,,,,,,,,,What are chemotherapy side-effects?
,,,,,,,,,,What are chemotherapy side-effects?,"Chemotherapy – often abbreviated to chemo or CTX – is a cancer treatment that uses anti-cancer drugs to fight the disease. Chemo is very common and is used to treat most types of cancer, both as a cure and as a method of improving the prognosis.","Chemotherapy can result in a wide-range of side-effects. Cancer cells are characterized by their tendency to divide rapidly; chemo therefore fights the disease by attacking fast-dividing cells. Unfortunately, healthy cells that divide quickly are also targeted, resulting in adverse side-effects.","Although there is no way to prevent chemotherapy side-effects altogether, there are methods of managing them that can lessen their worst symptoms.",Some of the more common side-effects of chemotherapy may include:,"
Fatigue
Vomiting and nausea
Hair loss
Anemia
Loss of appetite and feeling full after eating only a small amount
Sleeping issues
Sex and fertility issues
Emotional stress
Bruising and bleeding
Diarrhea and constipation
Mouth and throat problems
Skin and nail problems
Memory loss
","There is a higher risk of chemotherapy side-effects in the elderly. With increasing age, the total body water decreases, leading to a reduced volume of distribution for drugs that dissolve in water. The total body fat increases, changing the body’s distribution of drugs that dissolve in fat.","In addition, kidney function may decrease, leading to a decreased clearance of drugs that are excreted by the kidneys. Furthermore, the presence of other conditions, as well as other drugs being taken may, among other factors, all impact on the tolerability of chemotherapy.[1]",Common side-effects of chemotherapy,"Side-effects of chemotherapy differ from person to person, ranging from mild to severe, depending on the type of cancer that is being treated, the chemotherapy drug that is being administered, the length of the course and the general health of the person.[2]","It is difficult to predict what side-effects will be experienced. Of those listed below, it is unlikely a person will experience them all.[3]",Fatigue from chemotherapy,"Fatigue – lack of energy – is the most common side-effect of chemotherapy. Those undergoing chemotherapy often feel a whole-body tiredness that is not relieved by sleep, and which may make them unable to carry out everyday tasks or work. Fatigue may continue once the treatment is over; intensive chemotherapy weakens the body, meaning full recovery can take a long time.","There are many possible underlying causes of fatigue, some of which have medical treatment options. Where possible, the best way to combat fatigue is to find out and treat the underlying cause. For instance, there are medications available for fatigue caused by anemia.",Vomiting and nausea from chemotherapy,"Vomiting and/or nausea is common to those undergoing chemotherapy. It can be managed with anti-sickness drugs which can be prescribed by a doctor. It should be noted, however, that these drugs can also have their own side-effects.",Chemotherapy hair loss,"Many people find that hair loss is one of the most distressing side effects of chemo treatment. This side-effect is common but won’t affect all people. The head is the most common location for hair loss, though other regions of the body can also be affected. In almost all cases, the hair will grow back once the chemotherapy has been completed.","Depending on the type of cancer and type of chemotherapy used, it is sometimes possible to reduce the chances of hair loss by wearing a cold cap during a treatment, designed to cool the scalp, reducing blood flow to the scalp and therefore reducing the amount of medicine that reaches it.",Anemia from chemotherapy,"By lowering the amount of red blood cells in the body, chemotherapy can also result in anemia. Symptoms of anemia can include fatigue, heart palpitations, shortness of breath and paleness of complexion. Treatments for anemia differ according to its severity; a doctor will be able to explain the best options.",Loss of appetite and early satiety from chemotherapy,"People going through chemotherapy often experience a loss of appetite, i.e.  the feeling of not being hungry, and/or early satiety, i.e. the feeling of being full after eating only a small amount. These changes may last the entire drug regimen or may only be experienced immediately after a treatment. Causes of loss of appetite include:","
Taste changes
Dry mouth
Mouth sores
","It is recommended that the affected person try to eat what they can, and, if their doctor says it is ok, ensure they drink plenty of fluids. Some medications may be prescribed by a doctor for long-term lack of appetite.",Sleeping issues from chemotherapy,"Problems with sleep, or insomnia, are common during chemotherapy. It may be helpful to think about possible causes, such as certain medications, pain or anxiety. A healthcare provider will be able to offer advice on how to manage sleep issues.",Sex and fertility issues from chemotherapy,"Chemotherapy may lower a person’s libido or sex drive. Chemotherapy can also result in reduced fertility in both men and women. If there are concerns about lasting infertility, options such as IVF and egg/sperm banking can be explored with a doctor.",Emotional stress from chemotherapy,"Chemotherapy can result in a large amount of emotional stress. This stress can take the form of anxiety and may develop into depression. Talking therapies such as counseling and psychotherapy, as well as support groups to share with others in similar circumstances may help with the emotional stress of chemotherapy.",Bruising and bleeding from chemotherapy,"Chemotherapy can often reduce the number of platelet cells in the blood. This can result in severe bleeding when cut, skin that bruises easily, nosebleeds and bleeding gums. Treatments to improve platelet cell count are available. These include corticosteroid drugs and, in severe cases, blood transfusions.",Diarrhea or constipation from chemotherapy,Diarrhea and/or constipation can be a common side-effect in the early stages of chemotherapy. An affected person can consult a doctor for dietary recommendations to minimize diarrhea or constipation.,"If the problem persists and a doctor says it is ok, over-the-counter medications may be taken to help minimize this side-effect.",Mouth and throat problems from chemotherapy,"Chemotherapy can result in mouth and throat ulcers or sores, also known as mucositis. These ulcers can be painful and result in difficulty eating and drinking. They can also become easily infected. If necessary, doctors can prescribe painkillers or other appropriate treatments.",Skin and nail problems from chemotherapy,"Dry, itchy, discolored or sore skin can result from chemotherapy. The nails can also become brittle or flaky. Ointments and creams can be prescribed to help.",Chemotherapy memory loss,"For reasons that aren’t completely clear, chemotherapy can also result in short-term memory loss and an inability to concentrate properly. This side-effect usually dissipates once the treatment is complete. Many people manage this by setting reminders, keeping written records and asking for help where necessary.",More serious chemotherapy side-effects,Some side-effects of chemotherapy are less common but can become serious.,Osteoporosis from chemotherapy,"People undergoing chemotherapy are more at risk of developing osteoporosis, a condition that thins and weakens the bones. Women, particularly those over the age of 50, as well as people with breast cancer, are most at risk of osteoporosis.[4] Getting enough calcium and vitamin D lessens the risk of developing the condition. If osteoporosis does develop after chemotherapy, treatment options are available.",Heart problems from chemotherapy,"In rare cases, heart problems can occur with chemotherapy. The symptoms of this may include a rapid or irregular heartbeat, fatigue, chest pain, coughing, dizziness and breathing problems.[5] In extreme cases, these heart problems may lead to a heart attack. If a person experiences any of these symptoms, it is important they contact their doctor immediately.",Eye problems from chemotherapy,"Anti-cancer drugs used in chemotherapy can, in rare cases, lead to eye problems, including cataracts, conjunctivitis, dry-eye syndrome, glaucoma and photophobia, also known as light sensitivity, i.e. a discomfort or pain in the eyes due to light exposure.[6]",Thorough washing of the hands and the avoidance of unnecessary touching of the eyes can reduce the risk of eye problems.,Long-term side-effects of chemotherapy,"The duration of chemotherapy side-effects varies. A majority of chemotherapy side-effects will continue in duration for the length of the chemotherapy and disappear soon after the treatment has finished. However, some can be more long lasting, and others can develop after the chemotherapy has finished.",Chemo side-effects after treatment may include:,Organ problems,"The anti-cancer drugs used in chemotherapy can lead to long-term problems in organs such as the heart, lungs, kidneys and bladder.[7] To lessen the chances of developing these problems, doctors will check the person’s medical history before administering the drugs, and avoid uncomplimentary drugs accordingly.",Risk of second cancer,"Some chemotherapy drugs have been linked to causing a second cancer of a different type. It is important to realize that this is very rare, and that doctors will avoid the use of these drugs if at all possible. They will also advise about the risks before going forward with the treatment.[8]",Chemotherapy side-effects FAQs,"Q: Are there any natural remedies for chemotherapy side-effects?
A: There are a variety of natural remedies that may help with the management of mild chemotherapy side-effects. Always talk to a doctor before beginning to use any chemotherapy side-effect remedies, as some methods could interfere with the treatment itself. Natural chemotherapy side-effect remedies include:[9]","
Ginger: Research suggests eating or drinking foods containing ginger can act as a natural antiemetic.
Relaxation: Taking steps to relax can help to reduce stress, something that may contribute to chemotherapy side-effects.
Zinc: Eating foods rich in zinc, such as beef, shellfish and fortified breakfast cereals, may help prevent taste changes, a side-effect of chemotherapy, radiation and some pain medicines.
Glutamine: Taken in supplement form, glutamine may help to reduce weakness and numbness or pain in the hands and feet, and mouth sores and soreness, though evidence is not conclusive.
Acupuncture: Many people report that this helps with pain relief, as well as other symptoms such as nausea, dry mouth and anxiety.
","Q: Chemotherapy side-effects: when do they start?
A: Chemotherapy side-effects can be acute, meaning immediate, or late, meaning they are delayed. Acute side-effects may begin when the treatment is given or very soon after it is finished. However, some people may develop side-effects further into the treatment or after treatment is finished, or may have no side-effects at all.[10]","Q: Do chemo side-effects get worse with each treatment?
A: Some people undergoing chemotherapy report that they feel more fatigue the further along they get in their regimen. Nerve damage can occur with chemotherapy, and this may get worse with each dose. Sometimes, treatment has to be stopped because of this. However, other side-effects, including nausea, constipation and diarrhea, are not typically cumulative with repeated treatment.[11]","Q: What is the timeline for chemo side-effects?
A: Everyone reacts differently to chemotherapy, and some people may have mild or no side-effects at all or only experience one or two symptoms. However, the first symptom following treatment is often nausea, which may last for a few hours after each treatment or may linger for several days, and may continue throughout the drug regimen. Symptoms that may develop slightly later, in the days, weeks and months after beginning treatment, include:[12]","
Mouth soreness and changes in taste: Often occurs within 5-10 days after starting. Typically goes away gradually in about 3-4 weeks after treatment is finished.
Fatigue: Usually begins after the first week or two of chemotherapy. Normally resolves within six months after treatment.
Loss of mental acuity: Often occurs within the first few weeks after beginning chemotherapy. May increase, depending on the dosage, type of chemotherapy and general health of the person affected. May last for up to a year or two after treatment is finished.
Hair loss: Usually begins within 2-3 weeks after starting chemotherapy. Tends to start growing back 2-3 months after treatment is finished.

,,,,,,,,,,What is a chest cold?,"A chest cold, or acute bronchitis, is a condition affecting the bronchial tubes of the lungs, causing short-term inflammation and irritation of these airways. Common symptoms include a persistent cough, shortness of breath and fatigue.","Most often developing out of respiratory infections such as flu or a common cold, chest colds are caused – in most cases – by the same set of viruses as cause the common cold. In rare cases, a chest cold can also be caused by a bacterial infection.[1]","Most people find that a chest cold clears up in two to three weeks, without the need for treatment. In severe cases or when the symptoms do not subside in the normal timeframe, doctors will recommend treatment options.","A chest cold is generally considered to be a non-serious condition. However, there is a risk that a chest cold will develop into pneumonia – a more serious condition. A persistent chest cold may also be diagnosed as chronic bronchitis, a long-term condition that cannot be fully cured.[2] If you think that you may be experiencing a chest cold, a symptom assessment using the free Ada app may be able to help.",Acute bronchitis vs. chronic bronchitis,"Chronic bronchitis differs from acute bronchitis by its persistent nature. Acute bronchitis, which shares the same symptoms as chronic bronchitis, is a short-term condition that typically fades in two to three weeks, whereas chronic bronchitis is a permanent or constantly recurring condition, most often caused by smoking or the inhalation of irritants or dust. To be classed as chronic bronchitis, a cough must be present for a minimum of three months in each of two consecutive years and all other possible causes ruled out.",Read more about Chronic Bronchitis,Symptoms of a chest cold,"The main symptom of a chest cold is a cough, which will often be persistent and accompanied by the coughing up of mucus. The production of excess mucus is normal during a chest cold – a response designed to protect the respiratory tract from germs and bacteria. Other symptoms may include:[3]","
Fever
Headache
Aches and pains
Other symptoms associated with a cold or flu
","The cough associated with a chest cold will typically take two to three weeks to disappear completely. If you are experiencing any symptoms of a chest cold, try using the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.",Causes of a chest cold,"A chest cold can be either a viral or bacterial infection, though it is far more common to contract the condition virally. The viruses that cause the condition are of the same variety as those that cause the common cold or flu, and it usually develops from these conditions. If a cold or flu seems to worsen, therefore, it may be that a chest cold has developed.","The viruses that cause a chest cold are most commonly passed on through tiny droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks. The virus can survive on a surface such as a countertop or door-handle, for example, for up to 24 hours.[4] To help avoid infection, individuals should take measures such as washing their hands thoroughly and avoiding sharing drinking glasses and utensils.",Diagnosing a chest cold,"Doctors will usually be able to diagnose a chest cold by asking some questions about a person’s symptoms and by performing a physical examination.[5] In some cases, a doctor may order further tests to diagnose the condition or distinguish it from other conditions. These tests include:[6]","
Pulmonary function test: Used to check for signs of asthma or emphysema.
Sputum tests: Used to identify the bacteria within sputum (mucus).
X-ray: Potentially useful in identifying the source of an individual’s symptoms.
",Chest cold treatment,"A chest cold does not require treatment in all cases – it will normally begin to fade in two to three weeks,** though the cough may persist for longer.","If the coughing is particularly severe, cough medication is available over the counter, or it may be prescribed by a doctor. Pain relievers such as ibuprofen and paracetamol can be taken to suppress pain. For those with allergies, asthma or chronic obtrusive pulmonary disease, a range of medications can be prescribed as needed.[7]","As a chest cold is in most cases caused by a virus, antibiotics are useless and may even be harmful. However, if it is thought that a chest cold is bacterial in origin, antibiotics can be used to effectively treat the condition.",Chest cold home remedies,"Although treatment may not be necessary for a chest cold, there are a range of home remedies that can be used to manage its symptoms. Some of the most common home remedies include:[8]","
Rest: Rest is vital in order to help the immune system regain its strength.
Hydration: Drinking plenty of water helps thin out the mucus in the chest, making it easier to cough up.
Hot drinks and lozenges: Drinks such as tea with honey and over-the-counter lozenges can provide some relief from certain symptoms.
Steam: Steam from a hot shower or towel can help dislodge mucus and relieve symptoms.
",There are many natural products which can effectively help alleviate the symptoms of a chest cold. These include:,"
Apple cider vinegar: Raw, unfiltered apple cider vinegar helps thin the mucus in the chest, which can reduce congestion and help a person with a chest cold to breathe better. Drinking a solution of warm water mixed with two teaspoons of apple cider vinegar two or three times a day for a week will help reduce the duration of a chest cold and strengthen the immune system, preventing future colds.
Turmeric: Tumeric, a plant and spice that grows in Southeast-Asian and Middle-Eastern countries, is very effective at reducing the symptoms of a chest cold. It contains the compound curcumin, which has antiviral, antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. Adding around a teaspoon of raw, grated turmeric or powdered tumeric to a hot drink several times a day or using it to flavour food can help alleviate the symptoms of a chest cold.
Ginger: Ginger has been used as a natural remedy to treat various conditions for over 2000 years and is an effective agent in reducing the inflammation in the chest caused by a chest cold. It can be added to food in its raw state, brewed as a tea or taken as supplements.
Essential oils: There are many different types of essential oils, each of which are particularly helpful with alleviating the symptoms of a different array of conditions. The most helpful essential oils for treating a chest cold include frankincense, oregano, eucalyptus, tea tree and lemon. Essential oils can be added to a hot compress, bath water, dabbed on the neck and temples or administered using a vaporiser/diffuser. When using essential oils to treat a chest cold, always consult the instructions on the packaging for the most appropriate way to apply them.

,,,,,,,,,,What is childhood absence epilepsy?
,,,,,,,,,,What is childhood absence epilepsy?,"Absence seizures, also called petit mal seizures or childhood absence epilepsy, is a form of epilepsy in which seizures appear as short, undramatic episodes of a loss of awareness. This condition usually begins between the ages of four and ten and affects children who are otherwise healthy. Patients usually present with staring episodes, accompanied by a sudden loss of awareness that typically lasts between five and twenty seconds. This condition is treated with epilepsy medication. Most children with absence epilepsy will have their symptoms well controlled with medication, and many will find that their seizures alleviate as they get older.",Risks,"Absence seizures are a are form of epilepsy. Seizures occurs when there are episodes of uncontrollable and disorganized electrical activity in the brain. This condition is caused by a gene mutation which seems to affect the growing brain, but not the adult brain. For this reason, absence epilepsy often runs in families. The siblings of children with this condition have about a 10% probability of also developing epilepsy. Childhood absence seizures are slightly more common in girls than boys. Absence epilepsy usually begins between the ages of four and ten years old. It is uncommon for absence seizures to begin after age 14.",Symptoms,"The symptoms of an absence seizure are short episodes of staring or unawareness which occur several times a day. This may occur mid-sentence, or appear as if the child is daydreaming. During these episodes, there may be other signs such as lip smacking, chewing movements, sighing, eyelid fluttering or small jerks of the head. After the episode, the child has no memory of this period. Some children are first diagnosed when their seizures cause difficulties at school.",Diagnosis,"The diagnosis is made by an experienced doctor or pediatrician based on the symptoms and a description of the seizure. A test called a video-EEG (video- electroencephalography) is often conducted, which involves a test for electrical signs of seizure in the brain (electroencephalography) while the child is videoed in order to observe the seizure characteristics.",Treatment,"Absence seizures can usually be well controlled with epilepsy medications. No special treatment is needed during an absence seizure, though it can be helpful to gently touch the child to check if they are having a seizure or daydreaming.",Other names for childhood absence epilepsy,"

,,,,,,,,,,What is asthma in children?
,,,,,,,,,,What is asthma in children?,"Asthma is a disease which primarily affects the bronchial tubes in the lungs, called the airways. Children affected by asthma typically experience breathing difficulties due to the inflammation of the airways.","Asthma can cause acute discomfort – such as an asthma attack – and can have a debilitating effect on the child’s overall health, including symptoms like tiredness, depleted strength and recurrent coughing.",The most common signs of asthma include:,"
Wheezing
Chest pain
Shortness of breath
",These symptoms may be present every day or only during an asthma attack.,"Asthma affects around 6.2 million children in the U.S.[1] If a child experiences recurrent coughing, wheezing, tightness or pain in their chest or shortness of breath, it is important to consult a doctor, as one or more of these symptoms may indicate childhood-onset asthma.","When the respiratory system is functioning normally, as in a healthy child, the airways allow oxygen to pass into the lungs, which supply it to the rest of the body via the bloodstream. The airways of an asthmatic child are hypersensitive and will react by becoming inflamed and swollen when certain physical and environmental triggers enter the airways. This swelling makes it difficult for sufficient air to pass through the airways to the lungs, causing the child to experience breathing difficulties.",The potential impact of childhood-onset asthma on a child’s quality of life and long-term health can be significantly minimised by identifying appropriate treatment to bring their symptoms under control. Children with untreated asthma tire more easily after exercise than their peers and are prone to coughing and wheezing.,"With effective treatment, it is possible to reduce the symptoms of asthma, so that asthmatic children can carry out their day-to-day activities as normal, including participating in exercise and outdoor activities.",Symptoms,"Children are affected by asthma more commonly than adults. Asthma in children usually starts to develop in early childhood. Asthmatic children often present symptoms at under five years of age. Despite the presence of asthma-like symptoms, it can be difficult to diagnose asthma in infants and young children, as their lungs may not be developed sufficiently to carry out certain tests.","One of the first signs that a child might be affected by asthma is an involuntary whistling sound which accompanies their breathing. This is commonly known as “wheezing.” Typically, wheezing is especially prominent when the child exhales.",Other possible signs and symptoms of childhood-onset asthma include:,"
Chest pain
Chest tightness
Depleted stamina after play or exercise
Diminished energy throughout the day
Difficulty drawing breath
Recurrent coughing, typically at night
Retractions (involuntary pulling in of the chest which occurs as a result of laboured breathing)
Shortness of breath
","If you are concerned that your child, or a child that you know, may be showing signs of asthma, get a free symptom assessment with the Ada app.",Triggers,"When a child experiences an asthma attack, their airways are reacting to specific triggers in the environment.[2] The absolute cause of asthma is still unknown, but there are many different triggers (stimuli) which are associated with bringing on asthma attacks or aggravating asthmatic symptoms.","Triggers affect every child differently. Children may appear to outgrow, or become immune to, certain triggers. Equally, they may develop new sensitivities as they mature. The intensity of their adverse reactions to specific triggers may also increase or decrease.",Environmental triggers of asthma in children include:,"
Airborne irritants (such as pet dander) and pollutants (such as scented cleaning products)
Weather conditions, especially changes in temperature or humidity
",Physical triggers of asthma in children include:,"
Allergies
Emotional extremes such as stress, anger or nervousness
Exercise
Gastroesophageal reflux
In infants, feeding
Negative reactions to pharmaceutical medications such as painkillers
Respiratory infections such as colds and/or flu
",Skin or food allergies can cause asthma symptoms to occur in some children. This is called allergy-induced asthma or allergic asthma.,Allergy-induced asthma,"Allergy-induced asthma is the most common type of asthma. Allergic asthmatic children are simultaneously affected by allergies and asthma. It is possible to confuse an allergic reaction, such as hay fever, with a flare-up of asthma. It can be difficult to determine whether a child’s symptoms relate to either condition, or to a combination of both. This is further complicated by the fact that it is possible for both reactions to be stimulated by the same trigger.",Allergens which commonly trigger allergic asthmatic reactions in children include:,"
Dander from pets
Dust mites
House dust
Pollen
","If a child appears to be affected by asthmatic symptoms, allergic reactions or a combination of the two, it is advisable to visit a health care provider or an allergist, who will be able to help identify the principal triggers, and suggest further stimuli to be avoided.","An allergist may also decide to prescribe medications against allergy symptoms, such as antihistamines. These will need to be factored into the child’s overall treatment plan, which will involve measures to manage their asthma. These may include asthma medications, immunology programmes and/or the use of a nebulizer, depending on the severity of the child’s condition and how often they experience a flare-up. (See Treatment for more information.)",Causes,"It is not always possible to identify the cause of asthma in children, and a child may develop the condition with no apparent triggers. The main possible causes of asthma in children are:","
Genetic predisposition. Children with a family history of asthma, eczema, hives and/or allergic rhinitis develop asthma more commonly than those without.
Environmental factors. Exposure to air pollutants, including cigarette smoke and potential triggers of asthma, including dust mites, pollen and pet dander, may cause children to develop  asthma.
Infections. Children may develop asthma as a result of certain types of infections that affect the airways, including viral infections such as the common cold.
",Risk factors,Some children are at greater risk of developing asthma than others. Risk factors for developing asthma include:,"
A family history of asthma and related conditions such as eczema
A medical history of allergic reactions, including food and pet allergies, skin reactions and hay fever
Living in an urban area, where there is greater exposure to pollution
Regular exposure to potential triggers of asthma such as cigarette smoke and pet dander
Obesity
Other respiratory conditions, including sinusitis (inflamed sinuses) and/or a chronic blocked nose (rhinitis)
Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
","Before puberty, boys are at greater risk of developing asthma than girls; the biological reasons for this are not yet medically understood.[3]",Diagnosis,"Each child experiences asthma differently, and a child may not exhibit all of the symptoms or respond to all the triggers listed. Within individual children, asthma symptoms and their severity may change. It is usual for the doctor to consider a range of possible causes for the child’s symptoms, in order to eliminate other conditions before offering a definitive diagnosis of asthma.",Non-allergic conditions that typically cause asthma-like symptoms include:,"
Aspiration (when pieces of food or other small items accidentally pass into the airway)
Pulmonary Aspergillosis (a fungal infection of the lung)
Respiratory tract infections such as bronchiolitis and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
Rhinitis (runny, stuffy nose)
Sinusitis
Vocal cord dysfunction
Acid reflux or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
Airway abnormalities caused by such as an esophageal disorder(where acid from the stomach triggers a reaction that inflames the airways) or neuromuscular respiratory diseases
","Many of these conditions commonly co-occur with asthma. A diagnosis of asthma in a child therefore requires the doctor to determine whether the child’s symptoms are purely asthmatic, caused by a condition other than asthma, or whether the child has developed another condition in addition to asthma.",Diagnostic tests,"A variety of tests are available to help diagnose asthma in children, including lung function tests and allergy skin tests. These tests usually work best for children of five years and older.","To diagnose asthma in children of 5 years and older, doctors tend to use the same tests that are used to identify the disease in adults. The main tests used to identify asthma are:",Lung function tests,"Lung function tests (spirometry) are primary tests used to measure how much air the child can exhale and how quickly. They involve using a device called a spirometer, attached to a mouthpiece by a cable. [4] To determine the severity of the asthma diagnosis, the child’s lung function is usually measured during three levels of activity: after taking asthma medication, after exercising and at rest.","Lung function tests employ flow volume loops to measure how quickly the child can inhale, and their maximum intake of breath in one inhalation. This helps detect obstruction of air in the neck, such as vocal cord paralysis or dysfunction- which helps to identify any non-asthmatic conditions that may be a correct or additional diagnosis.",Allergy skin tests,"When a child is diagnosed with asthma, and  the doctor suspects that they may be affected by allergic asthma, allergy skin tests may be used in addition to the tests for asthma to test for possible triggers which may be causing the symptoms. The skin is pricked, and solutions containing extracts of common allergy-causing substances are applied, such as animal dander, mold or dust mites. The child is then observed for signs of an allergic reaction.",Methacholine challenge test (MCT),"The Methacholine challenge test (MCT) is used to diagnose mild or intermittent (occurring at irregular intervals) asthma. If lung function tests do not result in the child’s asthma diagnosis, a doctor may order a methacholine challenge test. During this test, the child inhales increasing amounts of a mist of methacholine before and after spirometry. Methacholine is a drug that stimulates the nervous system and causes wheezing and shortness of breath.",Body plethysmography,"In some cases, a body plethysmography test may be carried out in addition to the diagnostic tests above. In this test, a child will breathe in and out in an instrument called a body box. The body box is airtight, and breathing in and out of it causes changes to the air pressure inside the box.","Medical professionals can monitor the air pressure inside the box to add many details to their understanding of how well a child’s respiratory system is performing. This test can be used to measure factors including the volume of air present in the lungs after breathing normally, the specific airway resistance (how much the respiratory tract resists airflow when a person breathes in and out) of the lungs and their total lung capacity.[5]",Diagnosing asthma in children under 5 years of age,"It is often very hard for doctors to provide a conclusive diagnosis of asthma in children under 5 years of age, as their lungs are not sufficiently developed to accurately carry out lung function tests. Many other conditions such as rhinitis, sinusitis, and respiratory tract infections, such as bronchitis, have the same symptoms as asthma.","For this reason, doctors often opt to observe a child’s symptoms over a longer period with regular check-ups, until it is possible to provide an asthma diagnosis.",Treatment,"There is no cure for asthma, but asthma can be managed with proper prevention and treatment. Treatment for childhood asthma focuses on minimising exposure to any identified triggers, so as to avoid flare-ups. With the right treatment options identified, it should be possible for a child to pursue their activities, including sports and exercise, as normal.","As children learn to avoid asthma triggers, it is possible for them to manage their symptoms so effectively that they appear to “outgrow” their asthma. More than three-quarters of children who develop asthma symptoms before age 7 no longer exhibit perceptible symptoms by age 16.","However, there is always the possibility of further flare-ups, and asthma, which has been successfully managed for long periods, can resurface later in childhood, or in adulthood. Types of medication for childhood asthma include long-term medications, courses of immunology and quick-relief medications to unblock the airways during an asthmatic flare-up.","Good to know: Children with asthma may also be referred to an allergist who will be able to advise on specialised treatment, if their asthma is allergy-induced.",Medications for treating asthma in children,"A range of different medications are available, depending on the severity of a child’s asthma. When a child’s symptoms respond well to treatment and the asthma is eventually running a lighter course over time, doctors may suggest switching to milder medications.",Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS),"These medications  are considered to be the most effective medications for controlling asthma when taken regularly. They work on a continuous basis to reduce swelling of the airways. The most commonly prescribed ICSs include fluticasone (Flovent Diskus, Flovent HFA), budesonide (Pulmicort Flexhaler), mometasone (Asmanex), ciclesonide (Alvesco) and beclomethasone (Qvar). These medications need to be taken regularly for several days to weeks, adhering to the prescription, before the child feels their full anti-asthmatic effects.",Short-acting beta-agonists (SABA),"These medications are nebulized medications which provide immediate relief of asthma symptoms. They work by relaxing the inflamed airways, making breathing easier. SABA medications, for example,  include albuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA) and levalbuterol (Xopenex HFA).",Long-acting beta-agonists,"These medications work by relaxing the muscles surrounding the bronchial tubes, which causes a widening of the airways. It is recommended that the long-acting beta agonists be used in combination with an anti-inflammatory medication, such as the inhaled corticosteroids.The most commonly prescribed LABA medications in the U.S. are salmeterol (Serevent), formoterol (Foradil) and a formoterol solution for nebulizers called Perforomist.",Combination nebulizers,"These medications contain both a long-acting beta agonist (LABA) and a corticosteroid. These drugs have very different ways of influencing the airways and have been found to offer a child the most benefit when they are combined. This allows a child to profit from both of their mechanisms of action at the same time and makes combination nebulizers an effective treatment option for childhood asthma (as well as adult asthma) in many cases. Commonly prescribed combination nebulizers include combinations of fluticasone plus salmeterol (Advair), mometasone plus formoterol (Dulera) and budesonide plus formoterol (Symbicort).",Leukotriene modifiers,"These medications are oral medications that can reduce asthma symptoms for up to 24 hours. They include montelukast (Singulair), zafirlukast (Accolate) and zileuton (Zyflo). Care should be taken when taking leukotriene modifiers as they have been, in rare cases, linked to psychological reactions, such as agitation, aggression, hallucinations, depression and suicidal thinking. Medical advice should be sought immediately if the child has any unusual reaction.",Anticholinergic agents,These medications are another treatment option for severe asthma. They work by widening the airways to allow for easier breathing. The most commonly prescribed anticholinergic medication is tiotropium (Spiriva).,Immunomodulatory agents,"These medications can be used to treat very severe cases of asthma in children, where symptoms persist despite the use of SABA, LABA and corticosteroid medications. This treatment involves introducing antibodies (biological agents which interact with the bodies cells to fight and interrupt the usual progression of an asthma attack) into the body.","The antibodies which are used to treat asthma in children are Anti-IgE (omalizumab) and anti-IL-5 (mepolizumab). Both of these medications have been found effective for treating asthma in children. In particular, in reducing exacerbation rate; the medical term for the condition becoming worse, or more symptoms developing, which can happen in a flare-up or an asthma attack. Their other benefits include helping bring a child’s asthmatic symptoms under control and improving their quality of life.","Mepolizumab (Nucala) may be appropriate for children with eosinophilic asthma, a subtype of asthma which is often severe, in which the whole respiratory tract becomes involved in obstructing the airways. mepolizumab works by reducing the number of eosinophils in the blood; the white blood cells that in large numbers interact with other factors in the blood and cause the airways to become inflamed, and thereby reduces the likelihood of an asthma attack for children with this type of asthma.","Omalizumab (Xolair) is used to treat children affected specifically by allergic asthma. It works by targeting immunoglobulin E, the substance produced by the body that causes inflammation of the airways in children with allergic asthma. This medication reduces the immune system's reaction to allergy-inducing substances, such as pollen, dust mites and pet dander, and calms inflammation. It is usually delivered by injection every two to four weeks.","Omalizumab is the only medication for asthma which must be administered by injection only. If it is recommended for treating a child, they will need to visit their healthcare provider to have the medication administered.",GINA guidelines,"The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) provides a five-stage treatment plan which is very helpful in devising the right treatment plan to suit the individual asthmatic child. The GINA guidelines arrange a series of asthma treatment options as a sequence,","Following the GINA guidelines, a doctor will prescribe a treatment plan and assess its efficacy during regular check-ups. They will adjust the plan accordingly, continually measuring the child’s response to their treatment and refining the plan as needed, until the symptoms of asthma improve.","The guidelines recommend a five-step plan for the ongoing treatment of asthma, according to the severity of the child’s condition. Children with mild asthma will be treated according to the guidelines outlined in Step 1 (see below) and children with more severe symptoms will begin treatment according to the guidelines outlined in Step 2, 3, 4 or 5, depending on the severity of their asthma at the time of starting treatment. A step down to a milder treatment option can be considered during a monthly check-up, if the doctor considers the child’s symptoms to have improved sufficiently.",The GINA approach to controlling asthma symptoms aimed at reducing risk and improving asthma management includes the following steps:,Step 1,"The doctor will consider prescribing a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and will prescribe a short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) for relief as needed. Acting within minutes, and lasting several hours, short acting beta agonists are nebulized medications which can quickly relieve symptoms during an asthma attack. ICSs work by  relieving airway inflammation caused by asthma.","Good to know: Long-term corticosteroid use is generally associated with severe side-effects, but the inhalatory steroids used in ICSs do not carry the same risks. When an ICS is administered correctly, the corticosteroid medication goes straight to a child’s airways and very little is absorbed into the rest of their body. ICSs are therefore safe for use on a long-term basis and tend to show their best effects after around three months of use.[6]",Step 2,"The doctor will definitely prescribe a low-dose ICS, as is considered for children at Step 1, as well as prescribing a SABA for relief as needed.",Step 3,"A low-dose ICS or a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) will be prescribed and a SABA or ICS for relief as needed.  In some situations, long-acting beta agonists have been linked to severe asthma attacks if they are taken only by themselves without an ICS. For this reason, LABA medications should always be given to a child with a nebulizer that also contains a corticosteroid (ICS). These combination nebulizers should be used only for asthma that's not well-controlled by other medications.",Step 4,A medium to high ICS/LABA will be prescribed and additionally SABA or another low dose ICS for relief as needed.,Step 5,"The doctor will refer the child for an add-on treatment for severe asthma, such as anticholinergic agents or immunomodulatory agents. They will also prescribe a SABA or ICS for relief as needed.",Additional treatments for allergic asthma,"
Desensitization or hyposensitization (immunotherapy): Allergen-containing injections or oral medication gradually reduce any reaction of the child’s immune system to specific allergens over a period of months or years. The length of the course and intervals between injections vary according to the individual’s symptoms.
Oral and nasal medications: The child may be prescribed antihistamines and decongestants in pill form, as well as, or as an alternative to corticosteroid, cromolyn (a drug that prevents the release of inflammatory chemicals such as histamine from mast cells) and ipratropium nasal sprays.
",Childhood Asthma FAQs,"Q: Does childhood asthma damage the lungs?
A: It is important to diagnose and begin treating asthma in children promptly, in order to prevent it causing long-term damage to the lungs. Chronic (long-term) asthma, or asthma which is not treated effectively over the course of many years, has the potential to damage the lungs on a permanent basis in two main ways: by causing airway fibrosis (scarring) of the tissue in the airways and by causing remodelling (permanent narrowing of the airways).[7]","Both of these changes result from the respiratory system being inflamed regularly for long periods. Not everybody has the potential to develop permanent lung damage from the inflammation associated with asthma, but it is important that all children with asthma begin effective treatment as soon as possible to avoid this outcome. The Asthma Center recommends that early and intensive treatment of childhood asthma should be focussed particularly on calming inflammation in order to reduce the risk of long-term lung damage.","Q: Can childhood asthma cause chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?
A: Not usually, especially if asthma in children is treated promptly and effectively. The primary causes of COPD – a type of obstructive lung disease associated with long term breathing problems and poor air flow which usually develops in adulthood – are smoking tobacco and exposure to poor quality air, for example, living in an area with high pollution.","However, COPD can also be caused by genetic factors and people, who are affected by asthma or who have been affected as children, are believed to be at greater risk than the general population of developing the condition.[8] Recent research indicates that persistent (long term, severe or ineffectively treated) childhood asthma can lead to reduced lung growth and function in adulthood, an outcome which is found to increase the possibility of developing COPD.[9]","Q: Can childhood asthma come back during pregnancy?
A: Many children appear to “outgrow” childhood asthma. However, there is no cure for asthma and there is always the possibility that a child may encounter new triggers and re-experience the symptoms as an adult. Pregnancy may place unfamiliar stresses on the body, which could trigger asthmatic symptoms.[10] Feeling unwell? Get a free symptom assessment with the Ada app.",Other names for childhood asthma,"

,,,,,,,,,,What is chiragra?
,,,,,,,,,,What is chiragra?,"Chiragra is a form of gout which affects the joints of the hands, and results in acute, painful episodes (attacks) of inflammation. The inflammation is caused by too much uric acid which forms small crystals in and around the joints. Uric acid is increased in the body by eating certain foods (especially seafood, red meat or organ meats such as liver or kidneys), as well as by drinking alcohol. The main symptoms of chiragra are swelling, tenderness and redness of the hand joints. Gout tends to affect people over 30 years old and men more commonly than women.",Risks,"Gout is the underlying cause of chiragra and is caused by excess amounts of uric acid in the blood, which forms crystals in the joints. These crystals are very irritating, and cause the joint to become inflamed (red, swollen and painful). Gout is a very common condition. It tends to affect more men than women, and becomes increasingly more common with age. Drinking alcohol, eating red meat or organ meats (such as liver or kidneys) and using certain medications (such as heart failure and high blood pressure medications) increases the chances of having gout.",Symptoms,"Typical symptoms include a severe pain in the hand and finger joints associated with redness, swelling, difficulty moving the joints and sometimes tophi (uric acid crystals deposits appearing as yellowish firm nodules). Symptoms often come on suddenly, and attacks of gout are often recurrent.",Diagnosis,Diagnosis is based on the individual's medical history and physical examination. A doctor may take a sample of fluid from a swollen joint to look for evidence of gout crystals in the joint. Blood tests can monitor the amount of uric acid in the blood. Ultrasounds or X-rays of the joint may be helpful to look for signs of damage as a result of gout.,Treatment,"Pain and swelling during an attack of chiragra is managed with anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving medications (such as ibuprofen, paracetamol or colchicine). Lifestyle changes, such as losing weight, a healthy diet and taking regular exercise, might also be helpful in the management of gout.",Prevention,Preventing future attacks of gout can be done by changing the diet to avoid foods which trigger attacks of gout and (if needed) with a medication called allopurinol. Allopurinol reduces the amount of uric acid in the blood. Losing weight might also be helpful preventing future attacks of gout.,Other names for chiragra,"

,,,,,,,,,,What is cholecystitis?
,,,,,,,,,,What is cholecystitis?,"Cholecystitis is inflammation of the gall bladder. It is a common condition. It tends to affect women more frequently than men, and becomes more common with age. The gallbladder stores bile, which is a liquid produced by the liver to digest fatty foods. After eating, the gallbladder squeezes bile down the bile tract and into the intestine. In most cases, cholecystitis is caused by a gallstone blocking the drainage of gall into the bowel. The condition usually has a sudden beginning, starting with pain in the upper or upper-right areas of the belly. Treatment is usually pain relief and antibiotics. The gallbladder may eventually need to be surgically removed (a cholecystectomy). Most people recover well from cholecystitis.",Risks,"Cholecystitis is a common condition. Women are more likely than men to have cholecystitis and this condition becomes more common with age. Other factors that increase the risk of cholecystitis are being overweight, having a family member who suffers cholecystitis, and (in women) having 1 or more children. In most cases, cholecystitis is caused by a gallstone blocking the drain of gall into the bowel. There may also be an infection of the gall bladder.",Symptoms,"Typical symptoms include pain in the upper or upper-right area of the belly, sweating, nausea/vomiting and symptoms that are worse when eating fatty food. Fever may suggest a bacterial infection.",Diagnosis,The diagnosis is made by a doctor based on the symptoms and physical examination. Blood tests are often taken to test for signs of infection or liver problems. An ultrasound scan or a computed tomography (CT) scan may be needed to examine the gallbladder.,Treatment,"Treatment of cholecystitis is usually pain relief and antibiotics. Avoiding fatty foods can help reduce the symptoms of cholecystitis. In recurrent, persistent or severe cases, surgical removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) may be recommended. If the cause is gall stones stuck in the bile duct, a procedure called ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) may be performed.This involves an endoscopy (a long camera through the mouth to the stomach and bile duct) to remove the stones.",Prevention,Reducing the amount of fatty food in the diet and losing weight gradually may also help to avoid further episodes of cholecystitis.
,,,,,,,,,,What is chronic bronchitis?
,,,,,,,,,,What is chronic bronchitis?,"Chronic bronchitis is a long-term condition causing inflammation and irritation of the bronchial tubes – the airways through which air passes to and from the lungs. People with chronic bronchitis will typically experience a persistent cough that will often bring up mucus. Other symptoms include fatigue, wheezing and shortness of breath.[1]","Chronic bronchitis is differentiated from acute bronchitis by its persistent nature. Acute bronchitis – which shares the same symptoms as chronic bronchitis – is a short-term condition that typically fades in two to three weeks, whereas chronic bronchitis is a permanent or constantly recurring condition, most often caused by smoking or the inhalation of irritants or dust.","According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), bronchitis can be classified as chronic if it affects a person in two consecutive years, over a duration of at least three months each time. Although chronic bronchitis cannot be cured, treatment options are available to manage the condition.[2]","If you are concerned that you may have chronic bronchitis, try using the Ada app to find out what the problem is.",Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),"People with chronic bronchitis, emphysema, or both, are said to have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The condition makes it difficult for the lungs to take in air and expel it while breathing, due to the narrowing or obstruction of the airways. COPD is usually caused by smoking.[3]",Symptoms of chronic bronchitis,"A cough and the production of mucus are the principal symptoms of chronic bronchitis. The severity of the coughing and the amount of mucus produced will differ from person to person, but these symptoms will generally persist for a minimum of three months at a time. Mucus, which is brought up when coughing, may be blood-tinged. Nasal mucus can vary in color, and can be green, yellow or clear. Often, mucus production will be at its height early in the day.[4]",Other symptoms of chronic bronchitis include:,"
Nasal congestion
Shortness of breath (dyspnea)
Wheezing
Sore throat

Contact a doctor if the following symptoms occur:[5]","
Symptoms persist for three weeks or longer
The condition is disturbing sleep
Fever is 100.4 F/38 °C or above
Mucus is discoloured
Wheezing or shortness of breath occurs
","Always consult a doctor if there is blood present in mucus; this can be an indication of other serious conditions, such as lung cancer.",Causes of chronic bronchitis,"Chronic bronchitis is caused by smoking in the majority of cases. Smoking can cause severe damage to the cilia – the tiny hairs that protect the lungs against germs and mucus – leading to repeated bouts of mucus buildup, as well as inflammation and irritation of the bronchial tubes. The longer an individual has smoked, the more severe the condition is likely to be. In some cases, chronic bronchitis can be caused by continual exposure to secondhand smoke.","Less commonly, chronic bronchitis can also be triggered by the inhalation of irritants such as air pollution, chemical fumes or toxic gas. Repeated exposure to such irritants increases the chances of developing the condition. People with certain underlying conditions, e.g. asthma or cystic fibrosis, as well as those with a genetic predisposition, are more likely to develop the chronic bronchitis.[6]",Chronic bronchitis vs. acute bronchitis,"The symptoms of chronic and acute bronchitis are very similar, yet their causes and prognoses are quite different.","In most cases, the chronic form of the condition is brought about by smoking or exposure to irritants and is permanent. Acute bronchitis, however, is a relatively non-serious and short-term condition that typically develops out of a common cold or the flu and which normally fades within two to three weeks.[7]",Read more about Acute Bronchitis »,Diagnosing chronic bronchitis,"In order to diagnose chronic bronchitis, a doctor will typically begin by inquiring about the symptoms a person is experiencing and performing a full physical examination. For further confirmation, a number of tests may also be ordered. These include:[8]","
Pulmonary Function Test (PFT): A series of tests to measure lung volume, capacity and other functions that gives doctors a rounded picture of lung health.
Chest X-ray: Useful in diagnosing chronic bronchitis and other lung conditions.
Sputum examination: Sputum, or mucus, can be tested to determine the cause of mucus buildup.
High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT): A type of CT scan that allows doctors to image the lungs.

The chosen treatment route will depend on the severity of the condition.","
Bronchodilator: A medicinal substance breathed in through an inhaler which helps open up the bronchial tubes and aids breathing.
Theophylline: Particularly useful for treating shortness of breath, this oral medication relaxes the muscles in the airways in order to help with breathing. Usually, this is only used under direct medical supervision, in a clinical setting.
Steroids: Corticosteroids help bring bring many of the condition’s symptoms under control, specifically by reducing both mucus production and the inflammation of the bronchial tubes.
",Lifestyle changes,"There are a number of lifestyle changes that can be made to help manage chronic bronchitis, including:","
Quitting smoking: Smoking is the leading cause of chronic bronchitis and can help aggravate its symptoms. See below for further information.
Avoiding irritants: Those who live in areas with high levels of air pollution, or those who come into regular contact with other airborne irritants should wear a mask or take other steps to avoid them.
Use a humidifier: Regular exposure to warm, moist air from a humidifier can be helpful in managing symptoms.
Exercise: Ideally for at least 30 minutes, three days per week. Exercise can help strengthen the muscles used to breathe.
","Those experiencing chronic bronchitis may also benefit from pulmonary rehabilitation (PR), a program designed to help improve the overall well-being of those with respiratory problems. Typically, the program will involve exercise training, nutritional education, breathing strategies and counselling.[10]",How to quit smoking,"Quitting smoking is often a very difficult process, but it is vital for treating, as well as preventing, chronic bronchitis.","The first step in quitting smoking should be a consultation with a doctor or healthcare provider who will be able to outline the best way to quit, taking into consideration a person’s individual needs and medical history.[11]","A combination of behavioral changes and medication is often the most effective way of quitting. Behavioral changes include avoiding situations in which you are around people smoking, or situations in which you would typically smoke yourself, as well as taking steps to avoid stress, such as taking up a new exercise regimen. Learning to recognise cravings and devising methods of counteracting them may also be useful.[11]","Several medications are available to aid people in nicotine withdrawal. Some of these are available over the counter, others may require a prescription from a doctor. The overarching name for this method of treatment is nicotine replacement therapy. Medication is available in a variety of forms, including patches, gum and lozenges, and can be effective in reducing the intensity of cravings and gradually weaning people off their addiction to nicotine.[11]",Chronic bronchitis prevention,"Chronic bronchitis cannot always be avoided. However, taking certain steps will lessen a person’s chances of developing the condition. These include:[12]","
Stopping or never starting smoking: Ideally, smoking should be avoided completely. Those who have already started should stop.
Wearing a mask: Avoid irritants in the air by wearing a mask when outdoors.
Controlling asthma: Managing the symptoms of asthma may be useful in avoiding chronic bronchitis.
",Complications associated with chronic bronchitis,Complications associated with chronic bronchitis include:[13],"
Dyspnea: shortness of breath

Emphysema: a long-term, chronic condition affecting the function of the air sacs in the lungs
",Proactively managing the condition can be effective in reducing the risk of complications arising.,Chronic bronchitis prognosis,"Chronic bronchitis is a progressive condition, meaning it gradually worsens over time. There is no cure, but the prognosis can be significantly improved through managing the condition via medication and lifestyle changes. However, in cases where an individual continues to smoke, where there is a considerable drop in lung function or where complications occur, the prognosis is generally poor, with patients typically given a life expectancy of five years or under.[14]",Chronic bronchitis FAQs,"Q: Is chronic bronchitis contagious?
A: Chronic bronchitis is not contagious – it is principally caused by smoking or exposure to irritants, meaning that it cannot be passed from person to person.[15]","Q: What is the difference between chronic bronchitis and emphysema?
A: Chronic bronchitis and emphysema are both types of obstructive pulmonary disease – an umbrella term for lung conditions that affect a person’s ability to breathe. Though the symptoms of each are similar, the way they affect the lungs is significantly different. Emphysema is a condition in which the alveoli (air sacs) in the lungs become distended and thereby deteriorate, whereas chronic bronchitis is a long-term inflammation of the lungs.[16]","Q: How can I tell if my cough is caused by chronic bronchitis?
A: A cough caused by chronic bronchitis can typically be differentiated from a cough caused by another condition by its duration and the other symptoms that accompany it. A chronic bronchitis cough will typically persist for at least three months and be accompanied by the bringing up of mucus, which may contain traces of blood and be green, yellow or clear in color.","Q: Is chronic bronchitis linked to lung cancer?
A: Research suggests that chronic bronchitis is associated with a higher risk of developing lung cancer. Although the exact reason behind this is not completely clear, cigarette smoking is thought to play a role.[17]"

Type A: autoimmune gastritis
Type B: infection with bacteria helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)
Type C: Prolonged use of alcohol or painkillers, like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
","Cases of chronic gastritis are declining in developed countries, and most people respond well to treatment.","Without treatment, chronic gastritis can progress over years to the point where the stomach lining is so damaged, the person is at risk of ulcers, gastric cancers and, more commonly in cases of autoimmune gastritis, anemia.[3][4]",Chronic vs. acute gastritis,"Chronic gastritis is similar to acute gastritis, but has a more gradual onset. The person with the condition may not notice symptoms. When pain appears, it is dull and long-lasting, whereas acute gastritis sets in quickly, but the pain is usually brief.[5]","Depending on the underlying cause, chronic gastritis can generally be treated relatively simply.

These include:,Atrophic gastritis,"If left untreated, severe chronic gastritis can develop into atrophic gastritis. This is where the protective mucus layer in the stomach is damaged, leading to loss of gastric glandular cells, which is compensated by cells usually found in the intestine. Eventually, gastric glandular cells are replaced by intestinal and fibrous tissue.

","Most gastric polyps are benign, but some can develop into gastric cancers.[22]",Causes,"If the protective layer of mucus in the stomach is damaged, gastric acids can irritate the stomach lining.","In around 90% of cases, chronic gastritis is caused by the bacteria H. pylori.[4] This bacteria creates an inflammation of the stomach lining and, gradually, stomach cells become damaged. H. pylori is usually acquired in childhood, though symptoms do not develop until later in life.","Another cause of damage to the mucus layer is the repeated use of NSAID drugs, such as aspirin, and excessive consumption of alcohol. These substances can irritate the mucus lining of the stomach. A small number of cases of chronic gastritis are caused by an autoimmune reaction.[23][24]",Causes of autoimmune chronic gastritis,"An autoimmune reaction can also cause chronic gastritis. The body’s autoimmune response causes an inflammation of the protective mucus lining of the stomach, which eventually atrophies the mucus-producing cells. This leads to fewer mucus-producing cells being available and, consequently, less protection for the stomach. This is accompanied by a loss of parietal cells in the stomach, which regulate stomach acid. Parietal cells also affect absorption of vitamin B12 and iron by the stomach, so their loss may cause malabsorption.[8]","It is not known what causes the autoimmune reaction, but people with autoimmune chronic gastritis often have other autoimmune conditions such as autoimmune thyroiditis, Addison’s disease or type I diabetes.[8][14]",Risk factors,"Certain population groups, and people who overuse certain substances are at increased risk of chronic gastritis:","
Habitual use of painkillers like aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen can change the composition of the stomach lining, leaving it less protected and causing both acute and chronic gastritis.
Excessive alcohol consumption is another common risk factor.[25]
Infection with H. pylori (type B)  is more common among older people. Incidences of H. pylori infection have been falling in the developed world since the 1960s, likely due to better hygiene practices.[26][27]
",Diagnosis,"To assist with the diagnosis of chronic gastritis, a doctor will take the person’s medical history, including their use of medications such as aspirin, NSAIDs and antacids, as well as alcohol consumption and travel to countries where H. pylori is endemic. They will also conduct a physical examination of the abdomen.","Depending on these factors, a number of tests may be used for a diagnosis:[7]","
Testing for H. pylori: These tests may include a blood, stool or breath test.
Blood test for anemia
Stool test for the presence of blood
",Other tests may include:,"EGD (esophagogastroduodenoscopy), also called gastroscopy or upper endoscopy: An EGD is a visual inspection of the stomach lining, performed by passing an endoscope – a long, thin, flexible tube with a lighted camera – down the throat and into the esophagus, stomach and upper intestine. The doctor can examine the stomach lining for signs of inflammation and take a small tissue sample (biopsy) to test for H. pylori.[28] An EGD is the best diagnostic tool for autoimmune chronic gastritis.[8]","Upper gastrointestinal (GI) series: Also called a barium swallow, this test creates a series of X-rays of the GI tract.

If the condition is caused by prolonged and excessive use of NSAIDs or alcohol, the person will need to stop taking those substances. A medical professional will be able to assist with replacement painkillers or with any withdrawal effects.[23]",TreatingH. pylori,"Antibiotics can treat H. pylori infection.

However, the vitamin B12 and iron deficiencies that it causes can be treated with supplements, in the form of tablets, shots or intravenous infusions.[8][14]",Follow-up endoscopies may be recommended to monitor development of atrophic gastritis and detect early signs of gastric cancer.[14],Diet and home remedies,"Diet does not play a role in causing chronic gastritis, though to ease symptoms, people may find it advisable to stop eating things that irritate the stomach, such as fatty, spicy or highly acidic foods. Some people choose to reduce foods containing lactose or gluten.","Other lifestyle changes that may help include eating smaller, more frequent meals rather than larger meals, weight reduction and stress management.","Over the counter medicines, such as antacids, may ease symptoms but will not address the underlying problem. Over-the-counter medicines should not be taken often and relied upon. A medical professional should be consulted if symptoms persist.",Chronic gastritis FAQs,"Q: Is there a cure for chronic gastritis?
A: Chronic gastritis caused by H. pylori bacteria or by use of NSAIDs or alcohol can be cured by either eliminating the bacteria or discontinuing use of the substance. However, if a person has had chronic gastritis for a long time, some of the damage to the stomach may be permanent.","Q: Is chronic gastritis dangerous?
A: Chronic gastritis is not dangerous, unless it develops into a more serious stage. If chronic gastritis progresses to atrophic gastritis it can increase the risk of developing ulcers, polyps, anemia and gastric cancers.","Q: Is chronic gastritis the same as antral gastritis?
A: Gastritis can affect any part of the stomach, but antral gastritis affects only the lower portion, known as the antrum. Causes are the same, but symptoms may also include indigestion and flatulence."
,,,,,,,,,,What is chronic heart failure?
,,,,,,,,,,What is chronic heart failure?,"Chronic heart failure, otherwise known as congestive heart failure or heart failure, is an ongoing inability of the heart to pump enough blood through the body to ensure a sufficient supply of oxygen. The causes of the condition vary, but some of the most common risk factors include old age, diabetes, high blood pressure and being overweight. Chronic heart failure is most common in men.","The condition’s name is potentially confusing; the term “heart failure” does not mean that the heart has stopped or is failing completely, but that it is weaker than is normal in a healthy person. In some cases, the condition can be mild, causing symptoms that may only be noticeable when exercising, in others, the condition may be more severe, causing symptoms that may be life-threatening, even while at rest.[1]","The most common symptoms of chronic heart failure include shortness of breath, tiredness, swelling of the legs and ankles, chest pain and a cough. It most commonly affects older people and people with other heart conditions and is typically treated with a combination of lifestyle and diet changes, and medications. Chronic heart failure is typically a long-term condition that gradually worsens over time. This is the feature that differentiates it from acute heart failure, which develops very suddenly. It cannot typically be cured, but symptoms can be managed effectively.",Types of chronic heart failure,"The condition affects the lower chambers of the heart, known as the right and left ventricles. The left ventricle pumps blood around the body, supplying it with oxygen. Chronic heart failure occurs when the heart cannot adapt to the body’s changing need for oxygen, for example when exercising or climbing the stairs.[1]","There are different types of chronic heart failure, classified according to how the heart reacts when it pumps. The two main types are:[1][2]","
Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: Also called systolic heart failure or HFrEF, this type occurs when the heart is too weak and doesn’t squeeze normally.
Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: Also called diastolic heart failure or HFpEF, this type occurs when the heart is too stiff and doesn’t fill with blood normally.
","It is also possible to be affected by a combination of these two types. Moreover, each type of chronic heart failure can affect the left ventricle, right ventricle or both simultaneously.",Symptoms of chronic heart failure,"The symptoms of chronic heart failure generally depend on the type of the condition being experienced and its location, i.e. which ventricle is involved.[2]","The main symptom of left-sided chronic heart failure is shortness of breath, which will generally become worse with activity or when lying flat. A cough may also present. If the condition is affecting the right-side of the heart, edema, a buildup of fluid causing swelling of the legs and ankles, is the most commonly experienced symptom.","Other symptoms, which may present regardless of which side of the heart is affected, may include:[1][2]","
Tiredness
Dizziness or lightheadedness
Nausea
Loss of appetite
Constipation
Weakness, commonly of the legs
Rapid heart rate, even when resting, or an irregular heartbeat
Chest pain or angina
",Doctors generally classify a person’s heart failure according to the severity of the symptoms being experienced. The New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification system is the commonly used grading system. People are sorted into four categories:[3],"
I: Physical activity is not limited by symptoms.
II: Physical activity is slightly limited. Rest is comfortable.
III Physical activity is markedly limited. Rest is comfortable.
IV: Unable to carry out physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms are present while resting.
","People experiencing possible symptoms of chronic heart failure should consult a doctor. In addition, the free Ada app can be used to carry out a symptom assessment.",Causes and risk factors of chronic heart failure,"Chronic heart failure has no single cause; it is most accurately thought of as a complication of a variety of other conditions, each affecting the ability of the heart to pump blood around the body effectively.","One of the most common conditions that causes chronic heart failure is coronary artery disease. CHD leads to a narrowing of the coronary arteries that supply the heart with blood and oxygen, depriving it of the oxygen it needs to function effectively. Although chronic heart failure is a common complication of CHD, it does not occur in all cases.",Read more about Coronary Artery Disease (CHD) »,"Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is another common cause. The condition places extra strain on the heart, which can, over time, cause chronic heart failure to develop.",Read more about Hypertension »,Other possible causes of chronic heart failure include:[2][4],"
Cardiomyopathy, i.e. diseases of the heart muscle
Arrhythmia, an abnormal heart rhythm
Diseases of the heart valve
Congenital heart conditions

Medicines and chemicals including some chemotherapy drugs and cocaine
Excessive alcohol consumption
Anemia
Thyroid gland disease
",Diagnosing chronic heart failure,"Diagnosis is typically based on a person’s medical history, a physical examination and a series of tests. Tests are used by doctors to identify the underlying cause of the chronic heart failure and may include:[1][2]","
Echocardiogram (ultrasound): This test uses high-frequency sound waves to provide doctors with an insight into the different functions of the heart. It is considered the most important tool in the diagnosis of heart failure.
Electrocardiogram (ECG):  Used to test and record the heart’s rhythm and electrical activity.
Chest X-ray: Able to give doctors a picture of the heart. Can also reveal if there is a buildup of fluid.
Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP): A blood test to measure BNP or NT-proBNP protein levels, both of which tend to be elevated in people with heart failure.
","In some cases, other tests, including urine tests and MRI scans, may also be used.",Treatment of chronic heart failure,"Once diagnosed, people with chronic heart failure will work closely with their doctors to create a treatment plan that works for them. In most cases, this plan will include a variety of lifestyle and dietary changes, as well as medications.",Lifestyle and dietary changes,Lifestyle and dietary changes that are often recommended for people with chronic heart failure include:[1][5],"
Stopping smoking: People who smoke should stop. Doctors are able to advise on the best methods of doing this.
Limiting alcohol intake: If a person’s condition was caused by alcohol consumption, they should stop. Doctors are able to advise on the best methods of doing this.
Losing weight: If a person is overweight, they should lose weight. This can lessen the strain placed on the heart.
Taking regular exercise: Exercise can help to reduce symptoms such as shortness of breath and fatigue. Before beginning a new exercise regimen, however, a person should consult their doctor about how to do this in a safe way.
Limiting salt intake: Salt can cause the retention of excess fluid in the body. By managing the amount of salt in one’s diet, therefore, chronic heart failure can be managed. A doctor will advise on how much salt should be consumed.
Weighing yourself daily: It is important for people who have been diagnosed with chronic heart failure to weigh themselves daily. If a person’s weight increases by around 2 kg (roughly 4 lb) over a period of 1 to 3 days, they should contact a doctor. This is a sign of fluid retention and may require intervention.
","People with severe chronic heart failure may be asked to limit the amount of fluid, including water, they consume. Doctors will advise on exactly how much fluid to drink and how to do this in a safe way.",Medications,"The type of medications prescribed will depend on the type of chronic heart failure being experienced, its underlying causes and its severity. In many cases, a combination of medications will be necessary; this combination may need to be altered over time, depending on whether hypertension and left ventricular ejection fraction has been controlled, and, importantly, whether the affected person is still displaying symptoms.",Some of the most common medications prescribed to help manage chronic heart failure include:[2],"
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors: ACE inhibitors can help to prevent a buildup of fluid and may be able to slow the progression of heart failure.
Beta blockers: Usually taken in combination with ACE inhibitors, this type of medication can help to protect the heart and slow the progression of heart failure.
Diuretics (water tablets): This type of medication helps the kidneys to pass extra urine, helping to ease excess fluid retention.
Mineralocorticoid/aldosterone receptor antagonists (MRAs): This type of medication also helps to prevent excess fluid retention.
",Doctors will advise on how and when to take medications. Reading the enclosed instruction leaflet is also recommended.,Other treatment methods,"In some cases, alternative treatment methods may be recommended by doctors. Often, these methods will be used to treat the underlying cause of chronic heart failure.","Devices, such as implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) and pacemakers, may be fitted in some people. In some severe cases, surgery to replace or fix the affected heart valve may be recommended. In rare cases, a heart transplant or the implantation of a left ventricular assist device may be necessary.",Prevention of chronic heart failure,A number of measures can be taken to help lessen the risk of developing chronic heart failure. These include:,"
Taking regular exercise, such as walking or swimming

,,,,,,,,,,What is chronic idiopathic constipation?
,,,,,,,,,,What is chronic idiopathic constipation?,"Chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) is an ongoing condition without any known cause or identified underlying illness. Constipation is a condition which can be defined as a state of unsatisfactory defecation, with characteristic features of infrequent stools and difficulty in passing stools, or both.[1] Eight million people in the US seek medical care for constipation every year, and one million are hospitalized.[2] It is likely that many people who have CIC do not report the condition to their doctors because they are embarrassed or do not see it as a major problem requiring medical care.","CIC and Irritable Bowel Syndrome both present as chronic constipation,[2] and are distinct from acute constipation. Acute constipation usually has an organic cause, such as medication or a medical condition, while chronic constipation usually does not, although medication can sometimes play a role.[3] The term idiopathic means that the disorder arises spontaneously, without any known cause. Chronic idiopathic constipation, therefore, is a type of chronic constipation that has no obvious cause. It is a form of functional constipation.",CIC is characterized by infrequent stools which are often difficult to pass. It typically affects women and older adults. The typical symptom of this condition is passing fewer than 3 bowel movements per week for more than 6 months.,"To diagnose CIC, a physician usually excludes all other causes of constipation.. The treatment options are limited but include dietary changes and physical exercise.",Symptoms,"Infrequent bowel movements and difficulty passing stool, are the most common symptoms. If you experience any of the symptoms listed below more than 25% of the time for six months or more, you may need to be assessed for CIC:[1][2][4]","
Straining
Hard stools
A feeling of incomplete evacuation, i.e. a sensation of stool remaining in the bowel after defecating
A feeling of blockage in the anus or rectum
Use of manual maneuvers; using the hands; to facilitate defecation
","In addition, a major symptom is having fewer than three bowel movements a week.","Good to know: Irritable Bowel Syndrome shares some symptoms with chronic idiopathic constipation, but people with IBS report pain and bloating more often than people with CIC, and report that their symptoms improve after defecation. This is not the case with CIC. People with CIC almost never experience diarrhea without using laxatives.[1] They also experience normal loose stools only rarely. For more information on Irritable Bowel Syndrome, see this resource","There are several gastroenterological symptoms which indicate that chronic constipation may have a serious medical condition as its underlying cause, rather than being idiopathic. These include:[2][3][4]","
Distended abdomen/severe bloating
Vomiting
Blood in the stool
Hematochezia[5]
Unintended weight loss
Anemia
Severe constipation of recent onset
Rapid worsening of constipation
Family history of colon or rectal cancer
",These symptoms are more likely to indicate a serious underlying condition in people who are over 50 years of age at the time of symptoms first appearing.,"Good to know: Constipation is a possible symptom of colorectal cancer, a common gastroenterological cancer that usually affects people who are older than 60 years of age. It is associated with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. For more information on colorectal cancer, see this resource.",Causes of chronic idiopathic constipation,"CIC is most commonly seen in women and older adults. The causes of chronic idiopathic constipation are largely unknown. However, possible causes include a reduction in fluid and fiber intake in the diet, changes in water balance, and changes in contractility of the colon.","There are several different forms of CIC, including chronic idiopathic constipation:[4]","
Normal transit constipation, where the stool may be harder than normal and therefore more difficult to pass, but moves through the colon at a normal speed
Slow transit constipation, where stools move through the colon more slowly than usual
Disorders of defecation or evacuation
",Disorders of defecation or evacuation include:[1][4],"
Rectocele, a condition where the wall of the rectum bulges into the wall of the vagina inside the body and forms a pouch
Rectal prolapse, a condition where the rectum protrudes through the anus and becomes visible outside the body
Dyssynergic dysfunction
","Dyssynergic dysfunction arises from problematic co-ordination of the various muscles and sphincters that control defecation. Defecation requires the muscles involved to coordinate the creation  of increasing pressure inside the rectum, followed by relaxation of the internal and external anal sphincters and relaxation of the perineal muscles.[1] This requires the coordination of the pelvic floor muscles, abdominal muscles, and the muscles in the rectum.[4]","If these structures do not work together, defecation becomes difficult. People experiencing dyssynergic dysfunction often report a feeling of obstruction and incomplete evacuation. Complications of dyssynergic dysfunction include rectocele, anal fissure and rectal prolapse.","In some cases, chronic constipation may be caused by certain medications, such as:[3]","
Antihistamines
Antipsychotic medications
Antispasmodic medications
Opioids
General anesthetics
Antiparkinsonian drugs
","Good to know: Medication-related constipation may be chronic (long-lasting) or acute (short-term), and may improve if use of the medication that is causing it is stopped.",Diagnosis,"The diagnosis is usually based on the symptoms that a person is experiencing and on conducting a physical examination. To confirm the diagnosis, all other causes of constipation – for example a medical condition, or medication – should be excluded.","Doctors who treat constipation are often specialists in gastroenterology. There are various international gastroenterological criteria that help doctors to determine whether CIC, rather than IBS, is present.",Some tests that may be done to aid diagnosis include:[2][4],"
Colonoscopy, in which an endoscopic camera is inserted into the colon, used to identify structural problems. See this resource for more information on preparing for a colonoscopy.
Blood tests to check for infection and other disorders. See this resource for more information on blood test results.
",** Colonoscopy** is used conservatively. MRI scans are also used sometimes.,"Good to know: If the person with CIC does not meet the criteria for being at high risk of colorectal cancer, doctors will usually be conservative about ordering diagnostic tests** and instead rely on taking a history from the affected person and evaluating their symptoms. Tests such as manometry, motility capsules, Sitz markers and scintigraphy are generally rarely used.",Treatment,"As it is not possible to determine the cause of CIC, the treatment options tend to be limited. Dietary changes, like increasing dietary fiber and water intake are usually helpful, as is doing regular physical exercise. However, diet, fluid intake and exercise are not uniformly effective, and some people with CIC may be recommended to use:[1][2]","
Fibre supplements such as psyllium, calcium polycarbophil, inulin and maltodextrin
Osmotic laxatives such as polyethylene glycol or lactulose
Stimulant laxatives such as bisacodyl, glycerol or sodium picosulfate
",Laxatives can help with softening stool and improving regularity of bowel movements. Fibre supplements have a similar effect.,"People who do not find that laxatives provide enough relief from the symptoms of CIC, or for whom laxatives are not recommended, may find serotonin agonists, such as prucalopride or velusetrag, useful.","However, the main medications that are recommended when laxatives do not work or cannot be used are lubiprostone (a fatty acid) and linaclotide (an oligo-peptide agonist).[1] These medications work by increasing the amount of chloride that is secreted into the gut, which increases the amount of fluid in the gut, which in turn stimulates bowel movements.[2] One side effect of linaclotide is diarrhea. Otherwise, both drugs are very effective for CIC.","People with CIC resulting from dyssynergic dysfunction may find biofeedback useful. (see FAQs). If done by a trained therapist, biofeedback can be used to correct incorrect defecatory technique and in that way “retrain” the pelvic floor.[1]","Probiotics, which replenish or balance the growth of healthy intestinal bacteria, may be helpful for some people.",Other names for chronic idiopathic constipation,"

",Chronic idiopathic constipation FAQs,"Q: How should CIC be treated in children? 
A: Young children may not be able to describe the symptoms of chronic idiopathic constipation to their caregivers, so it is important to be vigilant for signs of abdominal distress or discomfort in children, especially surrounding bowel movements. Treating constipation in children promptly can prevent it from becoming chronic. Frequent soiling is a symptom of CIC which is specific to children.[6] Children may experience feelings of shame and therefore not report discomfort to their caregivers. In addition, the feelings of discomfort and difficulty during bowel movements may mean that children begin to resist going to the bathroom or withhold stool.[7]","CIC in children can arise due to a number of different factors, such as a low-fiber diet and or taking certain medications, that may interact with one another.[8] While the condition cannot be cured, it can be treated. Treatment options include laxatives and enemas, as well as a special individualized diet. Children with CIC may be treated by teams of specialists including gastroenterologists, colorectal surgeons and urologists.[9]","Q: Do people with CIC need to be hospitalized??
A: People with CIC do not need to be hospitalized in most cases. Treatment procedures such as management of fecal impaction, use of laxatives, the administration of enemas, biofeedback therapy, and the manual management of minor rectal prolapse can all be done as outpatient procedures or at home.[10]","However, complications that may arise from CIC, such as moderate or severe rectal prolapse and rectocele may need surgical treatment, and this will involve hospitalization.[11][12] In very rare cases, people with chronic idiopathic constipation related to obstruction or slow transit may need surgery to remove a portion of the sigmoid colon.[13][14]","Q: Are there any home remedies that can help manage chronic idiopathic constipation?
A: Taking steps to manage chronic idiopathic constipation at home is possible, and home management often accompanies medical treatment.","Weight management, plentiful fluid intake and regular exercise are important in preventing severe constipation. Eating a diet high in fibre is also helpful in most cases. Although it is anecdotally believed that hot coffee beverages can stimulate bowel movements, this has not been conclusively scientifically established.[15]","Some people with CIC may find following a low FODMAP diet helpful, as it can reduce bloating, flatulence and cramps, as well as diarrhea or constipation. FODMAP stands for “Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides, and Polyols”, short-chain carbohydrates which are poorly absorbed by the body.","It should be noted that a low FODMAP diet is generally considered to be more useful in cases of IBS than CIC.[16] Because FODMAP can become complicated, people who are considering it as a method of managing CIC or IBS should consult a dietitian first.","Q: What is biofeedback?
A: Biofeedback is a method by which people can learn to control bodily processes that were previously believed to be involuntary or out of their control. Biofeedback can be used to treat symptoms, as well as boost overall wellness. It should be noted that, although it is non-invasive, painless, and usually free of side effects,[17] biofeedback needs to be done by a qualified therapist and requires input and effort from the person receiving biofeedback as treatment.[18]","In people affected by constipation, biofeedback is concentrated on learning to voluntarily relax the muscles that govern the opening and closing of the anal sphincter muscles.[17] The process uses a computer, special sensors that are placed inside the body, and verbal reinforcement and encouragement from the therapist. It is usually completely painless.","In biofeedback, sensors measure electrical currents produced by the activity of muscles in the affected areas. These currents are displayed as information on a computer monitor. Being able to see muscle movement in an easily-understandable form like this helps the affected person to visualise what is happening inside their body.[19] In this way, they can learn what is happening and how to control it."

Chronic laryngitis is an inflammatory condition affecting the larynx (voice box) which persists more than three weeks. Laryngitis may have infectious or non-infectious causes. It can affect people of every age and gender but is more common in men of middle age.","The main symptom of chronic laryngitis is vocal hoarseness, which occurs due to inflammation of the vocal cords in the throat. When the vocal cords are inflamed, this distorts the sounds made when air passes over them, in speech, resulting in hoarseness of voice.",Symptoms,"Typical symptoms of long-lasting laryngitis include vocal hoarseness, sore throat, a cough, and swallowing problems. The Ada app can help you check your symptoms. Download the free app or find out more about how it works.",Causes,"Laryngeal symptoms such as cough, sore throat and hoarse voice are frequently caused by prolonged irritation of the larynx and vocal cords. If laryngitis persists for weeks or months, this can result in vocal cord strain and injuries and growths or polyps developing on the vocal cords.","Non-infectious causes of persistent laryngitis can include overuse of the voice; which puts a strain on the larynx; overuse of alcohol, gastric reflux, smoking or cancer. Bacterial infections rarely cause chronic laryngitis.",Diagnosis,"Because laryngitis is usually acute, meaning that it goes away on its own after around two weeks, it is wise to seek medical attention if symptoms, including hoarseness of the voice due to inflamed vocal cords, sore throat and/or cough, remain present after this time. The diagnosis of persistent laryngitis is usually made by assessing the symptoms and examining the throat.",Treatment,"Treatment for long-lasting laryngitis depends on the source of the issue. If the laryngitis is caused by gastric reflux, that underlying condition should be treated. If the inflammation is caused by a bacterial infection, antibiotic medications are normally taken.","Aside from addressing the root cause with appropriate medications and/or therapies, treatment for persistent laryngitis mainly involves resting the voice and soothing the throat, to give the larynx and vocal cords a chance to heal. Self-care remedies that may be helpful include:","
Giving up tobacco products, especially smoking, which can dry out the throat and vocal cords.
Choosing non-caffeinated, non-alcoholic beverages, which can dehydrate the body, aggravating laryngeal symptoms.
Drinking plenty of water, to thin mucus in the throat, so that it clears easily. This decreases congestion and helps minimise the need to cough.
Using natural products that fight infection like ginger and turmeric extracts. These can be added to hot drinks, can reduce the need to cough and help fight infection.
Keeping clean by using antibacterial handwashes and wipes at regular intervals throughout the day, particularly after coughing. This will also help prevent the transmission of laryngeal infection to others.
Avoiding breathing in fumes from smoke or household chemicals, which can cause vocal cord irritation.

,,,,,,,,,,What is chronic renal failure?,"Chronic renal failure is a condition involving a decrease in the kidneys' ability to filter waste and fluid from the blood. It is chronic, meaning that the condition develops over a long period of time and is not reversible. The condition is also commonly known as chronic kidney disease (CKD).","Chronic renal failure is typically caused by certain other medical conditions that put strain on  the kidneys over time, including diabetes, high blood pressure or hypertension and long-term inflammation of the kidneys. Early symptoms of reduced kidney function include urinating more frequently, high blood pressure and swelling of the legs.","Around 15 percent of adults, or 30 million people in the United States are thought to have kidney disease at some stage. Because the condition takes some time to develop, it most commonly affects older people. Women are affected slightly more often than men, and people of African, Latin American and Native American descent are at higher risk of CKD.[1]","People who are at risk of chronic renal failure should have regular health checks, which include evaluating the glomerular filtration rate. This is a more reliable method of diagnosing early stages of chronic renal failure than waiting for symptoms to appear.","Treatment consists of managing the underlying condition and supporting kidney function. Chronic renal failure requires careful, lifelong management, and can progress to end-stage kidney failure which requires dialysis or transplant. However, many cases of chronic renal failure are mild to moderate and can be managed by patients with support from a doctor.[2]",Symptoms of chronic renal failure,"In the early stages of chronic renal failure, affected people often do not experience any symptoms. However, symptoms that may emerge during the early stages of chronic renal failure include:[3][4]","
The urge to urinate more frequently
Urine may be pale and foamy
Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure
Swelling of the legs
Poor appetite
Weight loss

Start your free symptom assessment using the Ada app.,Causes of chronic renal failure,"Chronic renal failure mostly occurs in people who have other medical conditions which cause damage to the small units in the kidneys, called nephrons, which are responsible for filtering waste and fluid from the blood.",Common conditions which can cause chronic renal failure include:[1],"
Diabetes. One in three adults with diabetes are likely to develop chronic renal failure
Hypertension. One in five adults with high blood pressure are likely to develop chronic renal failure
","People with diabetes and hypertension, who are at high risk of developing chronic renal failure, should have regular health checks to measure their glomerular filtration rate. Diabetics should also have regular microalbumin tests. These tests can detect early signs of the condition.",Less common conditions that can cause chronic renal failure include:[4][7][8],"
Polycystic kidney disease, a range of genetic disorders
Nephrotic syndrome, also called nephritis and glomerulonephritis, is a condition which damages the glomeruli[9] and can be caused by strep throat and lupus, among other conditions
Inflammation of the kidneys
Repeated kidney infections and frequent kidney stones
","People who have some malformation of their kidneys or urinary tract are at higher risk of eventually developing chronic renal failure. Once the kidneys have lost a significant amount of function, they may not be able to recover, and the person may progress to end-stage renal disease.",Diagnosis of chronic renal failure,"Chronic renal failure can be diagnosed by measuring kidney function and is typically tested for by taking blood and urine samples to measure creatinine levels. This is a waste product of creatine, which is a chemical the body produces to supply energy, primarily to muscles and the brain.[10]",The two main diagnostic tests are:[11][12][13],"
Glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Checks how well the glomeruli[9] are working. To check the filtration rate, a blood sample is taken which is then tested in a lab. The results are combined with factors including age, ethnicity, gender, height and weight to estimate a person’s glomerular filtration rate.
Creatinine clearance test. Another way of calculating the glomerular filtration rate. To perform the test, a person needs to collect all their urine for a 24 hour period and then provide a blood sample. Comparing creatinine levels in the blood and urine allows a person’s glomerular filtration rate to be estimated.
","If a person has a glomerular filtration rate of less than 60mL/min/1.73m2 for three months or more, they are classed as having chronic renal failure or kidney damage.[14] Normal results are in the 90mL/min/1.73m2 to 120mL/min/1.73m2 range.[11]","Additionally, an ultrasound of the kidneys and urinary tract may be necessary. In some cases, it may be necessary to take a small sample of the kidney, called a biopsy, in order to find the underlying cause for the condition.[4]","Diabetics should have regular microalbumin tests in addition to other tests. This test is used to detect very small levels of albumin, a protein usually found in the blood, in the urine. If the kidneys are damaged, albumin leaks into urine.[15]","If you are worried that you or a loved one may have chronic renal failure, you can do a free symptom assessment with the Ada app.",Treatment of chronic renal failure,"Treatment involves controlling the condition that is harming the kidneys.

,,,,,,,,,,What are cluster headaches (CHs)?
,,,,,,,,,,What are cluster headaches (CHs)?,"Cluster headaches (CHs) are a relatively uncommon headache disorder. This kind of headache affects people in bouts (clusters), over periods of weeks or months. According to the World Health Organization, CHs affect around one in a thousand people. They primarily affect adults, and the first episodes usually begin to appear during a person’s 20s or thereafter.","The most notable characteristic of CHs is the unprecedented intensity of the pain which those affected experience during a headache attack. Cluster headaches are described as one of the most painful types of headache. The exact causes of cluster headaches are unknown, but they are six times more likely to affect men than women.[1] Currently identified possible triggers include stress, exposure to allergens and heavy alcohol use.","An affected person may experience bouts (clusters) of 1-8 headaches per day, also known as cluster periods, for intermittent periods of time lasting weeks or months, usually followed by remission periods when the headaches stop. During remission, no headaches occur for months and sometimes even years. The cycles might be in step with the changing of the seasons. However, some chronic,year-round, presentations of the condition do not seem to have any connections to seasonal or environmental triggers.[2]","Although CHs are incredibly painful, they are not life-threatening, and treatment can reduce the frequency and severity of the headaches. In the short-term, treatment for cluster headaches focuses on lessening the symptoms of the headache attack. This usually involves specialized painkillers and/or oxygen therapy, i.e.inhaling pure oxygen through a face mask. Long-term treatment of CHs focuses on lifestyle changes and prevention.",Symptoms,"CHs are a subtype of headache called a trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia (TAC). Headaches of this kind are unilateral, meaning that they affect one side of the head and face:[3]","
Cephalalgia is the medical term for a dull, persistent, and usually moderately intense, pain in the head region.
Trigeminal refers to the trigeminal nerve, responsible for sensation in the face and motor functions such as biting and chewing. Correspondingly, the area affected by CHs is the facial area and the eye area in particular. CHs can affect either the left or the right side of the head, but most people find that they are usually affected on the same side each time.
Autonomic refers to the fact that the boyd performs the symptoms of CHs automatically, e.g. a runny nose and teary eyes.
","Cluster headaches are associated with pain which develops very suddenly and is incredibly intense. It has been described as an unbearable, piercing, burning and excruciating sensation.[2]","The intensity of the pain may cause people to move in an agitated manner during a CH attack. It is common for people to pace up and down during a headache attack, and some people even report making desperate attempts to bang their heads on walls and objects in response to the intensity of the pain.","In addition to its characteristic pain, one or more the following symptoms may be present during a CH:[2][4]","
A reddened, teary eye
Shrinking of the pupil in the eye
A drooping or swollen eyelid
A blocked and/or stuffy nostril
","When they occur, these symptoms will be located on the side of the head affected.",Other symptoms of CHs which may be present during an attack include:,"
A sweaty face and forehead
A pale or flushed face
Restlessness (pacing and agitated movement)
Spreading of the pain to the face, head, neck and shoulders
A need to avoid light and sound
","Many people only experience one or two of these symptoms in addition to the painful sensation, and it is possible for a person’s symptoms to vary between attacks. However, most people’s symptoms only vary very slightly from one headache attack to another.[5]","Good to know: A cluster headache is also known as a migrainous neuralgia, but is a different kind of headache from a migraine. Migraines are often confused with cluster headaches due to the fact that they can also be very painful and can affect people frequently or in bouts for periods of time, so it is important to be aware of their different characteristics to ensure that a person affected by headaches receives treatment for the appropriate type. (See the section on avoiding misdiagnosis.) If you think that you or a loved one may be affected by CHs, migraine headaches, or another condition, you can get a free symptom assessment by downloading the Ada app.",Read more about Migraine Headache »,Duration and frequency,"The natural duration of a cluster headache is usually approximately between 15 minutes and three hours, if there is no specialized treatment to reduce its pain and duration. CHs usually occur one to eight times per day, at the same time or times. It is most common for CHs to occur at night, one to two hours after falling asleep, waking up the affected person.[6]","After the headache, the pain usually alleviates very suddenly, leaving the affected person pain-free, and, usually, physically tired.",Episodic cluster headaches,"In people with episodic cluster headaches, CHs will occur every day for periods of weeks or months; six to twelve weeks is normal. This is the case in around 80 percent of people affected by CHs.[7]","The rest of the time, a person affected by episodic CHs will experience periods of remission with no CHs. These periods of remission may last months or even years before the next cycle of headaches occurs. Periods in which CHs occur, will usually happen at the same time or times each year. Many affected people experience CHs during Spring and Fall.",Chronic cluster headaches,"For 20 percent of people affected by CHs, the condition is chronic, meaning that the headaches occur all year round rather than in periodic or seasonal cycles. CHs are considered chronic if a bout of CHs lasts for more than a year and/or if periods of remission typically last for less than one month.[7]",Causes of cluster headaches,Only a small amount of information about the physiological mechanism that leads to cluster headaches is known.,"CHs are linked to increased activity in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus, which contains a control centre for many of the functions of the autonomic nervous system. A greater intensity in the activity of the hypothalamus during CH attacks has been detected by brain imaging studies on people affected by CHs.[8] However, the exact relationship between CHs and the activity of the hypothalamus is not yet understood.","They are also been linked to a person having elevated levels of histamine, a chemical produced as part of the body’s immune response to allergens. According to historical research into cluster headaches, people affected by CHs are likely to develop a headache attack when histamine is medically administered.[9]","A person’s food intake may contain histamine-rich foods, which can cause CHs. Histamine levels in foods vary, depending on how processed, ripe or matured they are. Foods which are rich in histamine and may cause CHs include: salty foods such as crisps and cured meats, alcohol, vinegar, cocoa and chocolate, shellfish, beans and pulses, and matured cheeses. Keeping a food diary may help to identify foods which are causing CH bouts or attacks.","Furthermore, having elevated levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter, has also been linked to CHs. Serotonin is mainly produced in the brain, and is found in the nervous system and gut. It promotes feelings of well-being.","However, the relationships between having elevated levels of histamine and/or serotonin and the development of CHs are also unknown.","Good to know: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) ‒ medications which are used to treat a variety of mental health conditions including depression and anxiety  ‒ are not believed to cause cluster headaches, despite the fact that they increase the level of serotonin in the brain. This is primarily because they are prescribed to raise serotonin levels which are believed to be low.","However, it is important that people who are using SSRIs inform their doctor when seeking treatment for CHs: SSRIs have cross-reactivity with certain medications used to treat CHs. For example, the first-line treatment for CHs, sumatriptan, from the triptan class of medications, works by stimulating serotonin receptors in the brain. The stimulation of the serotonin receptors resulting from the use of triptans has an effect called negative feedback regulation on the brain’s 5-HT synthesis. This effect leads to a larger than normal amount of serotonin being available for use by the brain.","Due to this effect, triptans may cause serotonin syndrome when used in conjunction with SSRIs. Serotonin syndrome is a condition involving high body temperature, sweating and tremors, occurring as a result of too much serotonin in the body.",Triggers,"In people who are affected by cluster headaches, certain triggers have been identified which may bring on a bout of cluster headaches. These factors have also been found to trigger headache attacks during a period when a person is experiencing a bout of CHs.","Known triggers of CHs, in people already affected by the condition, include:[4][10][11]","
Seasonal changes - CHs are believed to be linked to circadian rhythmicity and are therefore likely to occur as the body adjusts to taking in more or less light during the day: a property of the shoulder seasons rather than the extreme ones.
Weather changes
Exertion
Drinking alcohol
Smoking tobacco
Stress
Exposure to allergens, such as pollen and pet dander
Strong smells, such as paint, petrol or perfume
Temperature changes - hot towels, hot showers
High altitudes - air travel, trekking
Nitroglycerin, a chemical compound which is used in some medications for chest pain
Foods high in nitrates, e.g. preserved meats

",Risk factors for developing cluster headaches,"The exact cause of cluster headaches is unknown, but certain factors render a person at increased risk of developing cluster headaches. These include:[10]","
Being male
Using tobacco products; however, quitting using tobacco products is not known to affect a person’s chances of developing the condition
Drinking alcohol
Being older than 20
Previous trauma or surgery to the head
A family history of cluster headaches
","Research investigating CHs in various population groups has reliably identified that a small proportion ‒ up to 20 percent ‒ of participants have relatives who are also affected. A significant proportion of people who develop cluster headaches use tobacco products and/or consume alcohol heavily.[10] If you think that you or a loved one may be experiencing cluster headaches, you can get a free symptom assessment at any time by downloading the Ada app.",Diagnosis,"Anybody who thinks they may have experienced a cluster headache should seek medical attention without waiting for a repeat occurrence. To reduce the potential severity and overall impact of CHs on a person’s quality of life, it is important to diagnose and begin treating the condition as soon as possible.","There are no specialized diagnostic tests to establish whether a person is affected by cluster headaches. To diagnose CHs, a doctor will assess the following criteria:","Brain function. In order to rule out any neurological problems, such as brain or vessel abnormalities, which may be the cause of the headache(s), a brain scan will be performed. If any previously-unknown abnormalities are revealed, these will be considered to be the cause of the headaches, and a diagnosis of CHs will not be given at this time. Instead, the abnormalities will be investigated further and treated.","In otherwise-healthy people affected by CHs, the brain scan will be normal with no abnormalities. Doctors can then be confident that the CH attacks are caused by CH disorder rather than any impairment of brain function.","Doctors will also assess a person’s medical history with a focus on whether the person’s symptoms could relate to any other headache disorders, and find out whether a person has a family history of cluster headaches. Although the link between genetics and CHs is not understood, people with relatives affected by CHs are more likely to develop the condition.","Finally, doctors will find out whether a person’s experience of their headache(s) matches the diagnostic criteria for a cluster headache, which include:","
Having at least one symptom which is ipsilateral (on the same side of the head as the pain) in the eye, nose or face
Restlessness or agitation
A duration of 15 minutes to three hours without effective response to medication or painkillers
A frequency of between one attack every other day or eight attacks per day and an incredibly severe pain
",Avoiding misdiagnosis,"Doctors will be aware that a person may be affected by other primary headache disorders, which may result in them experiencing headaches that are similar to cluster headaches. These include:[3][12][13]","
Trigeminal neuralgia. A chronic pain disorder affecting the same nerve that is involved in cluster headaches.
Migraine. Some headache attacks can feature autonomic features such as teary eyes. Migraines can also often occur in bouts, which leads to the widespread misconception that a person is experiencing cluster headaches, when they are in fact experiencing clusters of migraines.
Hemicrania continua. A chronic, persistent headache that usually occurs on the same side of the face and head, usually consisting of a constant dull pain which intermittently becomes piercing.
Short-lasting, unilateral, neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT). Like CHs, SUNCT headaches are a subtype of trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia headaches, but their duration is much shorter than cluster headaches.
",Treatment,People who have been diagnosed with CHs are usually treated by a type of doctors specialising in brain and nerve conditions called a neurologist. Those affected by CHs will require both short and long-term treatment in order to manage their headache disorder:,"
Short-term treatment for CHs focuses on relieving headache attacks themselves by reducing their pain and duration
Long-term treatment of CHs aims to reduce the frequency of headache attacks and to prolong the periods of remission between bouts. With effective treatment, a person affected by chronic CHs may be able to reduce the frequency of their headaches to the point at which their CH disorder becomes episodic.
",Short-term treatment: managing a cluster headache attack,"After having diagnosed CHs, doctors will discuss a range of treatments which a person can use during a headache attack in order to relieve their pain. The pain associated with a CH is so severe that it cannot be alleviated with traditional over-the-counter (OTC) painkillers.","Specialized treatments for CHs can usually relieve headache pain in 15-30 minutes. These treatments are called abortive agents because they begin to relieve (abort) pain more quickly than OTC painkillers, which are designed to be swallowed. They can be administered by vaporisation, i.e. breathing them in through the nose, or by injection into a muscle, or vein.[14]",The principal abortive agents used to relieve the symptoms of a CH attack are oxygen therapy and sumatriptan injections.,Oxygen therapy,"This treatment involves breathing in pure oxygen through a mask at the start of a CH attack. Masks and containers of pure oxygen will be provided by a person’s doctor, and they will be shown how to use the equipment so that they can carry out this treatment themselves, independently, whenever a CH strikes.","The rate at which the oxygen is dispensed from the container can be adjusted, and people are usually recommended to breathe in oxygen at a rate of around 15 litres per minute at the start of the attack, which they can decrease to a rate of six to eight litres per minute when the symptoms subside. It is important to continue breathing in the oxygen for five to ten minutes after the attack has finished, otherwise it may return.",Sumatriptan (triptan class medication) injections,"Sumatriptan is a medication which is used in the treatment of migraines and cluster headaches. It works by narrowing the blood vessels in the brain, which stops the transmission of pain signals. Sumatriptan works best as an abortive agent when injected into the skin and can be injected into the outside of the thigh or upper arm. Never inject sumatriptan into a vein or muscle.[15]","A person’s doctor will demonstrate how to inject sumatriptan, and these injections are then safe to use independently, ideally at the first sign of a CH attack. Sumatriptan is most effective when used at the start of a CH attack. Doctors will recommend the appropriate dose and dosing schedule in each case.[16]","It is also possible to use sumatriptan as a nasal spray, but this method of administration is considered to be significantly less effective at reducing CH symptoms than sumatriptan injections.","Always inform a doctor if a person is on a course of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) medication before taking sumatriptan. SSRIs increase the levels of serotonin in the brain, a property which sumatriptan shares. Using two serotonergic medications, agents which increase serotonin levels, simultaneously can lead to serotonin syndrome: an adverse reaction to having too much serotonin in the body.",Recovery after a CH attack,"CH attacks can be physically exhausting. Although the pain of a cluster headache will alleviate after using an abortive agent, the affected person is likely to benefit from a period of recovery, which may involve resting, spending time in a calm, quiet room and drinking water to stay hydrated.","If a person is likely to be affected by CH attacks at work, it is recommended that they inform their workplace, so that their employers understand the nature of the condition and can accommodate their needs. During a bout of CHs, these may include working from home or taking several breaks to manage attacks.[17]",Long-term treatment for cluster headaches,"For people who experience cluster headaches so frequently that they cannot manage the condition effectively using oxygen therapy or sumatriptan injections, additional treatments may be recommended. These include:[18][19]",Transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (TVNS),"This treatment involves providing the affected person with a small, handheld device which they can use to treat CH attacks when they occur. The device can also be used in between attacks to reduce their frequency. The TVNS device works by emitting a low-voltage electrical current, which, when applied to the skin on the neck near the vagus nerve, will stimulate it, relieving tension and pain. However, TVNS can, in rare cases, cause a CH attack to develop, and this treatment option may therefore be unsuitable for some people.[20]",Sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) stimulation,"The sphenopalatine ganglion is a nerve bundle which is located behind the nose. In people affected by CHs, low-voltage electrical stimulation of of the SPG can relieve the pain of a CH attack. SPG stimulation requires the implantation of a device – which is smaller than an almond – into the side of the face.[21]","General anaesthetic is used to implant the device, and a small incision is made in the upper gum on the side most affected by CHs. The implantation procedure takes around an hour, and there is no visible scarring. After implantation, people affected by CHs can activate the device to stimulate the SPG by using a handheld monitor when they feel an attack coming on. The SPG can also be stimulated between attacks to reduce their frequency.",Prevention,"The causes of cluster headaches are unknown, so it is not possible to prevent the development of the CHs disorder itself. However, using tobacco products is a known cause of CHs, and giving up tobacco products may therefore reduce a person’s chances of developing CHs.","People who are affected by CHs can take measures to prevent headache attacks, including avoiding triggers and making healthy lifestyle choices.",Being aware of triggers,"Keeping a diary of the circumstances surrounding one’s CHs can help a person to identify any possible triggers of headache attacks within a bout of CHs. Logging one’s CHs can also potentially help to establish the overall triggers of CH bouts, such as seasonal changes.","The affected person can then make lifestyle choices aimed at avoiding triggers, e.g. not wearing perfume in Spring and Fall, if their bouts of CHs generally occur during seasonal changes and strong smells are found to be a likely triggering factor.","Good to know: Many known triggers of CHs only cause a person to develop a headache if they are experiencing a bout. During a period of remission, a person may be able to encounter these triggers – such a drinking alcohol in moderation or smelling a strong scent – without being struck by a CH.",Preventative medications,"Preventative medications for CHs vary in effectiveness between people, and a person may need to try several different forms of medication to find the one that is right for them. A person may take preventative medication all year round in the case of chronic cluster headaches, or periodically to prevent headache attacks during a bout.[2] Doctors will help to decide on the preventative medication(s) that are most suitable for each person, according to their pattern of CH bouts and general health.","The first-line medication for preventing CHs is a type of medication regularly used in the treatment of high blood pressure, called a calcium channel blocker. In this case, it works to reduce vasoconstriction, which helps prevent CH attacks. These kinds of medications may cause heart problems to develop in some people, so a person’s heart will be monitored regularly, using an ECG machine when they are using this medication, to safeguard against this.[22]",Other medications which may be prescribed to as preventative treatments for CHs include:[22][23],Corticosteroids,"These medications are usually used in bursts of 2-3 weeks, generally to help break a cycle of CHs or in conjunction with other therapies that take longer to take effect. Due to the side-effects associated with long-term use, such as high blood sugar and the thinning of bones, these medications are suitable for short-term use only.",Greater optical nerve block,"This treatment involves injecting an anaesthetic and steroid medication into the nerves that supply the scalp, at the back of the head. It is carried out in hospital by a doctor and can bring about periods of remission in people with CH disorder lasting a month or more. The procedure takes around a minute to perform and can be repeated every two months.",Lithium carbonate,"Most often prescribed to treat chronic cluster headaches, this oral medication can help to re-regulate hormonal imbalances within the brain, reducing the frequency of CH attacks. However, use of this medication must be accompanied by regular blood tests to measure the levels of lithium in the blood. Having elevated levels of lithium for prolonged periods can cause problems such as kidney damage. Problems such as this can be avoided with close medical supervision.[24]",Anticonvulsant medication,"These kinds of medication have been found to be effective in inducing periods of remission in people affected by CHs and in reducing the frequency of attacks when taken long-term. It is taken orally, and the dosage is usually increased over time at the discretion of a person’s doctor.[25]",Making healthy lifestyle choices,"Although medical treatments are usually needed in order to bring cluster headache disorder under control, many people who are affected by CHs find that making certain changes to their lifestyle can help them in managing the condition and can reduce the frequency of headache attacks. These include:",Relaxation,Practicing relaxation skills such as yoga and deep breathing can help to diffuse stress and aid muscle relaxation. Setting aside periods of the day for relaxation and taking regular breaks from activities which involve sitting or standing in the same position can help to diffuse the buildups of muscle and nerve tension that contribute to CHs.,Resting well,"Getting eight hours of sleep a night and going to bed at the same time each day can help to reduce stress, which can reduce the frequency of CHs.",Exercising regularly,"Exercise releases beta-endorphins in the body, which can relieve stress. Exercising for 20 minutes, three times per week, can help to decrease the frequency of CHs and the severity of individual attacks.",Staying hydrated,"Drinking eight glasses of water or other non-alcoholic, non-caffeinated beverages per day can help. For people who are affected by chronic or persistent CHs, opting for non-alcoholic beverages instead of drinks containing alcohol all year round can help to prevent CHs. Cutting down on, or cutting out, caffeine, can also help prevent CHs.",Seeking help to quit using tobacco products,"The likelihood of being affected by CHs is greater among people who consume tobacco products than those who do not. In people with CHs, quitting is recommended. Doctors will be able to provide a range of resources on quitting smoking and connect a person to support programmes suited to their needs.",Complications associated with cluster headaches,"Although  a person may worry that they are dying during a cluster headache due to the intensity of the pain, this condition is not life-threatening and does not pose any direct health risks. However, relative to the general population, people affected by CHs may be more prone to certain behaviors which carry severe health risks, including:[10]","
Injuring themselves during CH attacks
Alcohol abuse
Other forms of substance abuse
Suicide attempts, in particular in cases of severe and persistent CHs)
",Diagnosing and beginning treatment for CHs is the best means of minimising these risks and avoiding complications.,"For people who have been correctly diagnosed with this condition, and who are being treated effectively, the most likely negative impact of CHs is a reduced quality of life, due to having to spend time away from work, education or social events during headache attacks. The extent to which a person’s quality of life is reduced by CHs can, in many cases, be lessened by accessing effective treatment options.",Cluster headaches FAQs,"Q: What are the key differences between a cluster headache and a migraine?
A: Cluster headaches are unilateral (affecting one side of the head). This is one of the principal factors which distinguish CHs from migraines. Migraines involve a more generalized pain and typically affect both sides of the head at once. Additionally, the duration of a migraine is usually much longer than that of a CH, up to 72 hours.[26] People affected by a migraine tend to want to sit or lie down, whereas a person experiencing a CH is prone to agitated movement.",Read more about Migraine Headache »,"Q: Are any home remedies or natural products effective at treating CHs?
A: The two most popular natural remedies for cluster headaches are:","
Melatonin. Taking supplements of melatonin, a hormone found naturally in the body which helps regulate sleep cycles, has been found to help reduce the frequency of cluster headache attacks.[27]
Capsaicin. Using a nasal spray or cream containing capsaicin, a compound with anti-inflammatory properties, found in hot peppers, has been found to help reduce the frequency of cluster headache attacks.[28]
",Read more about melatonin »,"Good to know; Not much clinical research has been carried out to establish the efficacy of either treatment in comparison to conventional treatments for cluster headache relief, such as suboptical steroid injections. In the evidence-based guidelines on treatments for cluster headaches devised by the American Headache Society, melatonin supplements are rated at grade C, i.e. possibly, rather than probably or certainly, helpful as a treatment for CHs, and intranasally applied capsaicin is rated at grade U, meaning that there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation.[29]","If a person wishes to incorporate natural remedies such as these into their treatment plan for CHs, they should consult a doctor before choosing natural products or beginning to use them. These treatments may not be suitable for everyone. Furthermore, some natural products may contain ingredients which do not combine safely with other treatments or medications."
,,,,,,,,,,What is colorectal cancer?
,,,,,,,,,,What is colorectal cancer?,"Colorectal cancer, or bowel cancer, is the most common cancer of the digestive tract. It arises from the colon (large intestine) or the rectum (final portion of the large intestine). Most colorectal cancers are diagnosed in adults older than 60. Almost all colorectal cancers start as benign (non-cancerous) growths that slowly progress into cancer. These polyps can be found early via regular screening. Although people with colorectal cancer may have no symptoms, some people experience abdominal pain, blood in their stool, a change in bowel habits and weight loss. Early diagnosis and treatment is important in giving the best chance of surviving bowel cancer.",Risks,"Colorectal cancer develops when a group of cells in the colon or rectum grow uncontrollably. These cells destroy the normal cells around them, and can spread into other tissues and organs. Colorectal cancer is a common cancer, and mostly affects people over the age of 60. Other risk factors for the development of colorectal cancer include: a family member with colorectal cancer; being obese; eating red meat regularly and eating little fiber; type 2 diabetes; and a history of inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis). Some rare genetic conditions also increase the risk of colorectal cancer.",Symptoms,"Symptoms of colorectal cancer may include a change in bowel habits, pain in the lower abdomen, blood in stool, unexpected weight loss and a feeling of tiredness and difficulty performing everyday tasks. Many people with colorectal cancer do not have symptoms in the early stages, so screening (testing people without symptoms) is important.",Diagnosis,The diagnosis of colorectal cancer can be made when a person develops suspicious symptoms or during screening (testing someone without symptoms). Testing for colorectal cancer involves testing the stool for small amounts of blood (called a fecal occult blood test) or via colonoscopy (a camera inserted through the anus to look at the bowel). The colonoscopy also allows for taking samples for further investigation if a growth is found. A CT scan (computed tomography scan) may also be done to stage the cancer.,Treatment,"The treatment of colorectal cancer depends on the size of the cancer, the exact type of cancer and whether the cancer has spread. The combination of these factors decides the stage of the cancer. Depending on the stage, colorectal cancer can be treated by radiotherapy, surgery and chemotherapy, or a combination of therapies. The treating doctor can give the best advice as to treatment. People who have had bowel cancer may benefit taking part in a support group or counseling program, especially while undergoing treatment.",Prevention,"Screening in important in preventing the diagnosis of colorectal cancer in the later stages. People who have a family member with colorectal cancer should ask their doctor about bowel cancer screening, as in some cases, these people begin screening at a younger age. Cutting back on red meat and increasing fiber in the diet may help to prevent some episodes of colorectal cancer. Losing weight, giving up smoking and reducing alcohol intake may also help to prevent colorectal cancer.",Other names for colorectal cancer,"

,,,,,,,,,,What is a colostomy?
,,,,,,,,,,What is a colostomy?,"A colostomy, or bowel diversion, is a surgical procedure used to divert one end or a loop of the large intestine out through the wall of the abdomen. An incision is made in the skin and through the abdominal wall to create an opening called a stoma, sometimes also known as an ostomy. Over this, a small pouch – known as a colostomy bag – is placed in order to collect excreted stool and other human waste.[1]","Colostomies can be permanent or temporary (around 65 percent of procedures are permanent). They are used to treat a variety of conditions that affect the large bowel (colon) and lower digestive tract, such as Crohn’s disease, colorectal cancer and ulcerative colitis. It is generally considered a routine procedure, yet it does carry some risks.[2]",Reasons for needing a colostomy,"Temporary colostomy surgery may be necessary following surgeries to remove or repair part of the large intestine. This form of bowel diversion allows stool and other waste to be diverted away from the repaired section of the colon, through the opening in the abdomen, giving the surgery site a chance to recover and heal.","In contrast, a permanent version creates an artificial outlet for stool, and is necessary when the body can no longer rid itself of these substances as the digestive system would normally, through the anus. This may be needed if the surgery involves the removal of the lowest part of the colon (the rectum) or the anal sphincter muscles.",Conditions and diseases that may require a permanent approach include:[3],"
Abdominal/pelvic region cancers including colorectal cancer and more rarely anal, vaginal or cervical cancer
Inflammatory bowel diseases including Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and, more rarely, diverticulitis
Bowel obstructions or injuries
Fecal incontinence (in severe cases)
Hirschsprung’s disease (a rare disease where the bowel lacks nerve cells)
",Types of colostomy,"There are a variety of different colostomy types, each corresponding to a different section of the colon.[4]","
Sigmoid: This is the most common type of colostomy, affecting the lower portion of the colon. A suitable treatment for conditions affecting the part of the colon near the anus, such as perianal Crohn’s disease.
Transverse loop: A transverse colostomy affects the top of the abdomen. This procedure externalises a loop of the intestine creating two openings; the proximal end – to which the pouch is fixed – and the distal end – which is inactive (no stool comes from this end).
Transverse single-barrel: This technique creates a single opening through the abdominal wall. It is permanent, and sometimes called a terminal colostomy.
Transverse double-barrel: In this method, the two ends of the bowel are sutured together and passed through the abdominal wall.
Descending: This method is performed on the left-side of the colon. Having already passed through the right-side of the colon, the output is solid and controllable.
Ascending: This method is performed on the right-side of the colon. Output is typically liquid. This is a rare operation because a stoma of the small intestine is usually preferred.
","Good to know: A person will be provided with recommendations to help prepare for their particular surgery. These may be different depending on each case; if a person has colorectal cancer, they may be recommended a different procedure and prep guidelines to someone with Crohn’s disease, for example. One may be given written related literature to consult, such as a colostomy guide. The colostomy guide will typically include instructions on food and liquid intake, clearing the bowel of stool and other waste, as well as recommended supplies and recovery tips.","Always call the doctor with any questions about the preparatory process, as it is important to follow all guidelines as closely as possible for best results.",Reversal of a temporary colostomy,"Reversing a temporary colostomy is generally a routine procedure carried out when the colon has healed. After reversal, stool and other waste will be excreted through the anus as normal and the stoma and pouch will no longer be needed. Reversal is normally carried out between 12 weeks and a number of years after the initial procedure, depending on a person’s recovery.[5]",Risks of a colostomy,"Although considered a fairly routine surgical procedure, colostomies still carry the chance of complications. As with any major surgical procedure, there are risks due to going under general anaesthesia and blood loss, as well as colostomy specific risks that include:","
Skin complications, ranging from mild irritation to ulceration and infection (present in 18 to 55 percent of cases)
Retraction – when the stoma in the abdomen recedes into the skin (present in 32 to 40 percent of cases)
Parastomal hernia (present in 14 to 40 percent of cases)
Necrosis, caused by insufficient blood supply to the stoma (present in 2 to 22 percent of cases)
Stomal prolapse – when the stoma becomes displaced (present in 2 to 22 percent of cases). This is more likely to occur when the muscle tone in the abdomen is poor, or in cases of excessive weight gain or obesity.
",Life after a colostomy,"Immediately following a temporary or permanent colostomy, a hospital stay of roughly two-weeks should be expected. To fully recover, however, two months may be needed. After recovery, modern advancements in colostomy care and improvements in pouch design mean that – following a period of adaptation – most people are able to lead a relatively normal life.","This includes being able to go back to work, enjoy a regular diet and take part in physical activity.[6] Individuals who have undergone colostomy surgery should, however, be aware that their stoma and pouch do need to be looked after to keep them functioning correctly.[7] Advice on how to do this and how to change a colostomy bag will be given by doctors and nurses after the procedure has taken place.","Good to know: In some cases, colostomy irrigation may be recommended. This is a method for people who have had permanent colostomies to achieve regular bowel movements, by flushing their colon with water inserted through the stoma, daily or every two days. This allows waste to exit the body as normal through the rectum and anus, as an alternative to collecting stool in a colostomy bag. Colostomy irrigation can help prevent constipation and is ideal for people who had regular bowel function before surgery, and whose colostomies affected the sigmoid portion of the colon."
,,,,,,,,,,What is a colostomy bag?
,,,,,,,,,,What is a colostomy bag?,"A colostomy bag, also called a stoma bag or ostomy bag, is a small, waterproof pouch used to collect waste from the body.","During a surgical procedure known as a colostomy, an opening, called a stoma or ostomy, is formed between the large intestine (colon) and the abdominal wall. This allows waste products to be excreted through the opening in the abdominal wall rather than via the colon through the rectum and anus. Stool and other waste products are drainable into the pouch, which can then be emptied at regular intervals.","This procedure is carried out in the treatment of conditions involving damage to the colon or large intestine, such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease, diverticulitis or colorectal cancer. The pouch is placed over the new opening that has been created in the abdominal wall –  in order to collect stool and other waste from the body.[1]","An ostomy bag, therefore, is a fairly simple device intended to rest the patient’s colon
in the case of a temporary procedure, or to act as an artificial outlet for the bowel when the
surgery is intended as permanent.",The use of a pouch to collect waste outside the body:,"
Is surprisingly common
Is not painful
Doesn’t necessarily involve a huge change of lifestyle
","Full guidelines on changing a colostomy bag and/or using a drainable version will be provided by the clinic that is treating the affected person, as well as advice on finding all necessary supplies, such as replacement pouches.",When is a colostomy bag needed?,"Colostomies can be necessary for people of all ages. Typically, they are recommended for those experiencing problems with their colons, such as Crohn’s disease, or when the anal sphincter does not function properly. The temporary or permanent use of a stoma and colostomy bag allows the body’s waste to bypass the colon.[2]","The diversion of waste from the body via the stoma/ostomy may be necessary for the treatment or management of certain conditions involving inflammation of, or damage to, the large intestine, including:[3]","

",Colostomy bag surgery,There are two main surgical procedures used to create a stoma in the abdomen:,"
Loop colostomy: A loop of the colon or large intestine is pulled through the stoma in the abdomen, opened, and stitched to the skin. The pouch is used to collect waste thereafter.
End colostomy: The end of the colon or large intestine is pulled through the stoma in the abdomen and stitched to the skin. The pouch is used to collect waste thereafter.
","Both procedures are considered routine, however, the exact method will depend on factors such as the medical condition that is being treated, and whether continence is expected to eventually be restored after recovery by means of a follow-up procedure known as colostomy reversal.","Both loop and end procedures are usually performed using keyhole surgery, as an inpatient procedure at the clinic, but some situations may require open surgery. Open surgery often has a longer recovery time.",Ileostomy,"This is a similar procedure that also entails the use of a stoma bag, which sometimes termed an ileostomy bag to differentiate. It is commonly carried out as a treatment for ulcerative colitis. This surgery involves bringing the small intestine out of the body to divert waste, then placing a stoma bag over the opening.[4] Bodily waste is then drainable through the opening, and does not need to pass through the colon and rectum.",Urostomy,"A urostomy – also called an ileal conduit – is a procedure that creates a stoma specifically to drain urine when passage through the bladder and urethra is not possible. A urostomy bag, which is of similar design to a colostomy bag, is used to collect the urine, which is then drainable via the stoma. A urostomy is a permanent procedure.",Is a colostomy bag permanent?,"Use can be temporary or permanent, depending on the type of surgery needed to treat the underlying medical condition. Temporary colostomies tend to be “loop colostomies” whereas permanent colostomies tend to be “end colostomies.”[5]",Colostomy reversal,"In the case of a temporary colostomy, surgery is needed to reverse the colostomy. This involves removing the colostomy bag and reconnecting the bowel, so that waste can then exit the body normal via the rectum and anus; the stoma will no be longer required. This is generally carried out 12 weeks or more after the initial surgery, but this time can be longer if complications arise during recovery. The procedure is considered straightforward and can usually be carried out using keyhole surgery.",Living with a colostomy bag,"After a patient is fitted with a colostomy bag, doctors, nurses stoma care experts or colostomy specialists will thoroughly explain how to maintain the stoma and what lifestyle changes may be necessary for adapting to using the pouch. Below is some general information and advice that should be noted by all colostomy bag users.",How does a colostomy bag work?,"Generally, colostomy bags consist of two pieces:[6]","
The flange, which adheres to the skin and should be changed every one to two days
The detachable pouch, which catches the waste.
","One piece systems, where the flange and bag are attached to each other, and are both disposed of and replaced simultaneously, are also available.",Choosing a colostomy bag,"Bags come in a wide variety of different sizes and capacities, and most brands offer each bag they make with a one-piece or two-piece option. Different bags may be suitable for different occasions and purposes. For example, a person may choose to use:","
A larger size stoma bag while sleeping, i.e. one which can hold around 650 ml of waste. This will help them to avoid leakage, as they cannot control or predict the volume of their nightly waste output.
A small stoma bag during their waking hours, when it can be changed as needed. I.e. one which can hold around 400 ml of waste.
","It is generally recommended that a person empty their colostomy pouch when it is one third to one half full. The smaller a colostomy pouch is, the more often it will need to be emptied.",Colostomy specialists will assist in deciding which type of colostomy bag suits the individual needs of a person. Factors that will be considered in helping a person choose the right kind(s) of bag for them include:[7],"
Where the stoma is in relation to the rest of the person’s digestive tract, which will help determine the volume of waste output. The higher up the digestive tract the stoma is, the greater the volume of waste output will be.
What kind of procedure the person had and how much of their gastrointestinal system will still be functioning as normal when the bag is in use, which will help determine the volume of waste output and the expected firmness of stools. In general, the smaller the section of the colon that is removed, the firmer a person’s stool will be.
Their lifestyle, including diet and physical demands of daily life, as well as any environments or activities that may require a particular size or style of pouch, i.e. wearing tight-fitting clothing, in which case a less bulky option may be preferred.
",Choosing a disposable or reusable bag,"All colostomy bags are designed to be changed and replaced regularly, but some types need to be changed more often than others. Choosing which type of colostomy bag to use is largely a matter of preference. Many people swap between different types, depending on their day’s activities.","The two main types of colostomy bag, both of which come in a wide range of sizes and capacities, are:",Closed-end pouches,These are designed for one-time use. They are often fitted with a filter designed to reduce gas buildup and prevent odors. Changing a closed-end pouch can be done as often as a person wishes and involves discarding the used pouch in a disposable bag - which is often provided with the pouch - and attaching a new pouch to the stoma.,"Many people who have undergone a colostomy choose to use closed-end pouches every day. Others choose to use them at certain times, i.e. for going to the beach or before sexual activity, when having a fresh/empty pouch may be considered ideal.",Drainable pouches,Rinse-and-reuse drainable pouches are suitable for people who have had all types of colostomy and ileostomies. They can be emptied into the toilet as needed and can be cleaned with water if necessary and resealed with a clip or velcro fastening.,"Many people prefer drainable pouches to single-use, closed-end pouches, as they do not need to be changed as often, and are therefore more economical and environmentally friendly.","Drainable pouches are usually fitted with a filter to reduce odors and drain gas. A drainable pouch should be discarded and replaced with a new one every three to four days. The functionality of the filter may decrease after this time, increasing the possibility that the bag could begin to smell. Furthermore, although it is easy to keep the outer parts of drainable pouches clean, changing the appliance regularly reduces any potential buildup of bacteria and minimises the risk of infection around the stoma.","Good to know: People who have undergone an ileostomy often choose to use a drainable pouch in everyday life, and a closed-end, single use pouch for particular occasions only. This is because a high volume of liquid stool is normal following an ileostomy. Many people find changing a single-use bag on a frequent basis costly and inconvenient.",How to change a colostomy bag,"The pouch can be changed as often as needed – usually, shortly after a bowel movement.
At first, the procedure may prove difficult but will get easier with practice. For basic guidelines,
follow these six steps:[8]","
Thoroughly wash your hands using antibacterial gel or soap.
Gently ease the pouch from the stoma, using adhesive remover to help if necessary.
By removing or cutting away the bottom section, empty the pouch of stool and other waste, into the toilet. If you don’t want to do this, pouches can be disposed of in their entirety into a disposal bag.
Clean the stoma with warm water and mild soap and thoroughly dry with a dry wipe.
Prepare the new pouch by removing the protective cover from the flange.
Place the flange over the stoma, ensuring there are no creases.
",Ensuring good adherence,"To ensure a tight seal over the stoma in the abdomen, the skin should be clean and dry. Humid conditions and increased sweating may therefore lead to reduced wear-time, so keeping a ready stock of replacement pouches is advised.",Colostomy bag accessories and supplies,"Aside from the basic components (flanges, pouches), there are a variety of accessories available to help with stoma care and use. The most commonly-used accessories include:[9]","
Belts: Belts help secure the colostomy bag to the body, reducing the risk of dislodgement and leakage.
Stoma paste:  These pastes help adhere the flange to the skin of the abdomen.
Stoma powder: Used to dry sore or inflamed skin around the stoma, allowing the flange to be applied more easily and effectively.
Wipes: Wipes can be used to clean the skin, remove adhesive residue or to form a protective film between the stoma and flange.
",Day-to-day life,"Generally, colostomy bag users are able to lead a normal life and take part in all the activities they wish to. There are, however, a few tips to keep in mind to avoid damage to the colostomy bag.","
Spare colostomy bags and accessories should be carried whenever possible. Patients typically have less control over continence following a colostomy, meaning the pouch may need to be changed unexpectedly when away from home.
Caution should be taken with pets or children who may unintentionally dislodge or damage the colostomy bag.
Food and drinks that cause flatulence, such as carbonated drinks, beans, cauliflower, cabbage, etc. should be avoided.
Once the stoma has healed, sports and exercise are possible. Specialized supports and smaller, more agile pouches are available to aid in this.
",Bathing and showering,"When bathing or showering, the colostomy bag can be either left in place or removed. If left in place, the outside of the filter should be covered using a sticky patch (that should be supplied by the hospital/doctor) to prevent any damage. If removed, it is best to select a time when the stoma will be less active – before, rather than following, a meal, for example. Before refitting the colostomy bag, ensure the skin around the stoma is completely dry.",Clothing,"Generally, clothing able to comfortably support a colostomy bag can be found in regular clothing outlets. However, clothing designed specifically with the needs of users in mind is also available from specialist outlets. Items include high-waisted trousers to suit those with a waist-level stoma, high-waisted underwear and specially designed swimsuits.",Sexual activity,"A healthy sex life is generally possible for people living with a colostomy pouch. The main obstacle may be embarrassment, which may be helped by the use of a smaller pouch or by wearing clothing that covers or secures the device in place.",Replenishing supplies,"After surgery, appliances and accessories will be supplied by the clinic, along with a prescription detailing the person’s requirements. When running low, the prescription can be taken to a doctor or pharmacy for replenishment of all essential items.","Good to know: It is usually possible to obtain a certain amount of free supplies on a long-term basis on prescription from one’s national healthcare provider. The National Health Service (NHS) in the U.K. recommends a monthly allowance of 30 to 90 single-use bags or 15 to 30 drainable (ileostomy) bags, and around 15 flanges.[10] Medicare in the U.S. offers a policy which covers around 80 percent of the cost of a person’s supplies after a doctor has confirmed the specific items and quantities required.[11]",Colostomy bag FAQs,"Q: After surgery for Crohn’s disease, will a pouch be needed permanently?
A: Not usually. The type of surgery which is usually recommended in Crohn’s disease is called a resection.[12] Doctors will consider performing a resection to remove the sections of the intestine which are inflamed, or damaged by inflammation. A resection of the intestine is carried out in cases where the symptoms of Crohn’s disease have not been alleviated by other treatments. When the inflamed sections of the intestine have been removed, the healthy sections will be stitched together. A resection is a major procedure and usually performed under general anaesthetic.","In people with Crohn’s disease who have undergone a resection, ileostomy may be prescribed, to divert stool and other digestive waste away from the colon to give the area of the intestine, which has undergone a resection, a chance to heal. Whether this is temporary or permanent depends on the nature of a person’s Crohn’s disease, their post-surgery recovery and their overall medical history. Even if doctors do not recommend reversal and it is decided that the best management plan involves a person using their continence pouch on a permanent basis, many people find that they experience a greatly improved quality of life with the pouch, compared to their previous experiences of managing Crohn’s disease.[13]","However, the type of surgery usually prescribed to treat Crohn’s disease is a loop form of the procedure, which is temporary. Most people with Crohn’s disease who have undergone this procedure will be able to have it reversed following successful healing. They will excrete waste via the rectum and anus as normal thereafter. See this resource for more information about Crohn’s disease.","Q: How can I learn to be comfortable with the idea that using a colostomy bag will be part of my life on a long-term or permanent basis?
A: There are many support groups, online and in real life, that exist specifically to help people, who are new to using a colostomy bag, adjust to the lifestyle changes that it necessitates. Social networks that help people connect with others who use colostomy bags are specifically designed for sharing tips and techniques to help people overcome any misgivings that they may have and to promote awareness that it is possible to live a normal, happy life after a temporary of permanent colostomy.","Dedicated websites and forums, such as More Than Your Bag, Coloplast and Living with a Stoma encourage people with all types of colostomy bags to share success stories. These personal narratives are intended to inspire others to feel positive about the improvements that their colostomy and use of a colostomy bag have brought to their health, rather than feeling disappointed about needing to use one.","Furthermore, over the past few decades, an increasing number of celebrities with colostomy bags and ostomies have spoken out about their usefulness.[14] This has further helped to normalize the idea that a person may require colostomy surgery during their lifetime. Furthermore, these stories help to show that everybody who undergoes a colostomy can go on to use their bag without problems and with a positive mindset, embracing the freedoms it offers.","Q: What is a colonoscopy bag?
A: There is no such thing as a colonoscopy bag, but it is very understandable to get confused, because colostomy and colonoscopy are such similar-sounding words. However, the definitions of these two procedures and their outcomes are very different. Simply put:","
A colonoscopy is a scanning procedure, in which a thin flexible tube with a camera on its end is inserted into the bowel via the anus and rectum. The only function of a colonoscopy is to provide images of the inside of the bowel; no changes to the body are made.
A colostomy is a surgical procedure in which an ostomy is created to provide an alternative means for waste to exit the body, temporarily or permanently. After a person has undergone a colostomy to create their ostomy, they will need to collect waste using a colostomy bag.
",Situations in which a person may undergo a colonoscopy include:,"
Diagnosis: Doctors may wish to see the inside of the bowel in order to find out more about what might be causing a person’s symptoms.
Before surgery: It is standard practice for surgeons to perform a colonoscopy in the run-up to many kinds of colorectal surgery. People who undergo a colostomy very often have a colonoscopy beforehand.

A: Yes, in some cases. When undergoing an MRI scan, it may not be possible to wear certain types of bag and flange which use magnets in their mechanism of attachment. This is because bringing magnets into the scanner can disrupt the imaging process and, furthermore, can compromise the magnetism of the device. However, it will be possible to check with your doctor and the radiology team  in advance of the scan whether your colostomy appliances are suitable.","People who use a colostomy bag and who are undergoing a CT scan with the use of contrast material should inform the person who will be performing the scan in advance. See this resource for more information about contrast material and undergoing a CT scanFor all types of imaging scan, people who use a colostomy bag, are encouraged to bring spare supplies with them on the day of the scan in case a fresh bag is required.","Q: What is a colostomy bag cover?
A: Feeling positive about the way that your colostomy bag looks is a key means of eliminating any negative impact it may initially have on your lifestyle or choice of activities. There are many companies which make attractive covers for colostomy bags out of different materials, and it is possible to order covers that are custom-made from the material of your choice.","Covers can be useful in situations such as going exercising or to the beach. If you would prefer not to display the bag itself, which may be visible in swimwear or sportswear, wearing a cover removes the need to wear extra clothing for this purpose.","Many outlets specialize in colostomy bag covers for specific types of activity, for example, purpose-built swimwear or underwear-style covers for intimate occasions. These can easily be purchased online. It is also possible to make colostomy bag covers oneself, using a sewing pattern to ensure accurate sizing."

It is one of the most frequently experienced acute illnesses in the United States and throughout the industrialized world. Adults will develop roughly two to three colds per year.[1]","The symptoms of a cold include coughing, sneezing, a sore throat and a runny or blocked nose. In most cases, a person experiencing a cold will have no need to visit a doctor, as the symptoms will typically clear up on their own in up to 10 days. Management techniques for the common cold include methods such as rest and hydration.",Common cold symptoms,"The symptoms of a cold tend to develop quickly, usually within a few days of an individual becoming infected.",The most commonly experienced symptoms of a cold include:[2],"
Coughing
Sneezing
A sore throat
A runny or blocked nose
A hoarse voice
Malaise ( a feeling of general discomfort and illness, which should to be confused with general fatigue)
",Less common symptoms of a cold include:,"
Fever (37-39 C / 98.6-102.2 F)
Headache
Earache
A feeling of pressure in the ears and face
Muscle pain
",The symptoms of a cold will usually begin to fade within a few days and clear up completely after roughly a week to 10 days. Colds will generally last longer (10-14 days) in children under five years old.,When to see a doctor?,"In most cases, a cold will  not require visiting a doctor. However, medical attention should be sought in the following cases:","
Symptoms do not disappear after three-weeks
Symptoms suddenly worsen
Breathing becomes difficult
",Common cold causes,"There is a large range of viruses that can cause a cold. Most colds are caused by a group of viruses known as rhinoviruses, of which there are over a 100 different types.[3]","After having a cold, the affected person becomes immune to that particular virus strain. However, due to the large amount of cold-causing viruses, many people still experience an average of two to three colds per year. As children tend to spend a large amount of time in close contact with other children and are less aware of the methods of preventing a cold, they are prone to experiencing an average of 8-12 colds per year.","Colds are normally spread through hand-to-hand contact and less commonly through coughing, sneezing or touching a surface that has been exposed to the virus.",Diagnosing a common cold,"Most people will be able to self-diagnose a cold by recognizing the symptoms being experienced. This will also be the case if a doctor is consulted, though this will not be necessary in most cases. If a complication is suspected, various tests may be ordered (such as an X-ray). If you think your symptoms may be those of the common cold, you check by doing a free symptom assessment with the Ada app at any time.",Common cold treatment,"A cold will typically remedy itself in up to 10 days. During this time, the symptoms of a cold can be managed through a combination of self-care techniques and over-the-counter medications. These methods, however, will not shorten the duration of the cold.[4]",Self care,"To help manage the symptoms of a cold, the following things may be effective:","
Adequate fluid intake
Getting plenty of rest
Eating healthily; a diet high in fibre, fruit and vegetables is recommended
Stopping smoking
",Over-the-counter medications,The following medications are generally available from a pharmacy without requiring a prescription. The information leaflet that accompanies the product should always be read before use and their guidelines should be followed.[5],"
Painkillers: Ibuprofen and paracetamol/acetaminophen may be effective for the relief of a fever and as general pain relief. Children may be given painkillers, though age-appropriate versions (usually available from pharmacies) are generally advised. Children should never be given paracetamol and ibuprofen at the same time. Some people prefer  to use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAIDs) medications such as aspirin to help relieve the symptoms of a cold. Under no circumstances should a child 12 years or younger be given these medications.
Decongestants: Oral or spray decongestants may be effective in relieving a runny or blocked nose and help ease breathing problems. They should not be taken by children under 6, and only on the advise of a doctor in children under 12. The effects of decongestants only last for a short period and should not be used for over a week.
Cold medicines: All-in-one cold medicines generally include a combination of painkillers and decongestants, making them effective at relieving a variety of cold symptoms. Generally, these medicines should not be taken in combination with any other medication.
Lozenges: Oral lozenges help to lubricate the lining of the throat, making them effective at relieving a sore throat.
Vapor rubs: Applied to the chest and back, vapor rubs can help a child breathe more easily. Although less commonly used, they may also be effective for adults.
",Common cold complications,"In the majority of cases, a cold will clear up without complications. However, a cold can lead to a weakened immune system, which can cause infection to spread into other areas. If this occurs, the following complications are possible.[6]",Sinusitis,"One of the more frequently experienced complications of a cold, occuring in roughly 1 in 50 people,[7] sinusitis is an infection of the cavities behind the forehead and cheekbones, typically caused by a virus. It is also possible to have bacterial sinusitis.",Symptoms of sinusitis include:,"
Sinus headaches (pain and tenderness around the forehead, nose and cheeks)
Runny or blocked nose
Fever (above 38 C / 100.4 F)
","Sinusitis will usually resolve itself. If symptoms persist for longer than a week, a doctor should be consulted. If you think that you or someone you know has sinusitis, you can check symptoms using the free Ada app at any time.",Middle ear infection,The development of a middle ear infection (otitis media) following a cold is most common in children. It is typically caused by bacterial infection.,Signs and symptoms of a middle ear infection include:,"
Pain in the ear (earache) (parents should look out for children pulling or tugging on the ear)
Fever (above 38 C / 100.4 F)
Temporary hearing loss
Fatigue
Vomiting
","A middle ear infection will generally clear up naturally within a few days. If symptoms persist for longer than a few days or repeated infections are experienced, a doctor should be consulted.

Confusion or disorientation
Pain in the chest
Blood in the phlegm
Symptoms last for longer than three weeks
","If you are concerned that you or someone you know may have a chest infection, you can do a symptom assessment at any time using the free Ada app.",Common cold prevention,"The viruses that cause colds are typically spread through the tiny droplets released when someone with a cold coughs or sneezes. This may happen when a person inhales these droplets after they have been released into the air, or, more typically, through skin-to-skin contact with an infected person (droplets are most likely to be present on the hands) or through contact with a contaminated surface or object.[8]","To help prevent the development of a cold, the following measures are advised:[9]","
Keeping the hands clean by washing them often with soap and water
Avoiding unnecessary touching of the eyes, nose and mouth
Staying away from people with a cold
",People who already have a cold should avoid spreading the virus by taking the following steps:,"
Staying home from work or school
Avoiding close contact with others (shaking hands, kissing, etc)
Completely covering the mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing
Washing the hands after coughing or sneezing
",Common cold FAQs,"Q: Do I have a common cold or flu?
A: Although the common cold shares symptoms with flu, it is, in fact, a far more serious condition and not merely a severe cold. As with a cold, a person with  flu may experience symptoms such as coughing, sneezing and a sore throat, but they are also much more likely to experience fever, fatigue and muscle aches. Flu symptoms also typically appear more suddenly and disappear after around a week. If symptoms persist for longer than this or are particularly severe, medical attention should be sought.[10] If you are not sure whether you have a cold or flu, you can do a free symptom assessment using the Ada app at any time.","Q: Is there a cure for the common cold?
A: No, there is currently no cure for the common cold. However, a cold will in most cases disappear naturally and its symptoms can be managed through a combination of self-care (drinking fluids, resting, etc) and medication (painkillers, decongestants, etc). As a cold is viral in nature, antibiotics are ineffective.","Q: What is the typical duration of a common cold?
A: In adults, colds tend to last for an average of 7 to 10 days. Children may have a cold for slightly longer, with it normally lasting for up to two weeks. If a cold persists for over three weeks, medical attention should be sought.","Q: What is the incubation period for a common cold?
A: The typical incubation period for a cold is 24 to 72 hours. After this, symptoms will begin to develop.[11]"
,,,,,,,,,,What are common warts?
,,,,,,,,,,What are common warts?,"Common warts, or verruca vulgaris, is a common dermatological condition that causes small, fleshy growths on the skin. They are most often found on the hands or fingers, but can also occur in any non-genital location. Common warts are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV) – an umbrella term for a group of viruses.","HPV is contagious, meaning common warts can be passed from person to person, whether through direct skin-to-skin contact or indirectly through contact with a surface or object that is carrying the virus. People with weakened immune systems and children are more at risk of developing common warts.","The condition is generally considered to be non-serious and will often clear naturally without treatment. However, if necessary, treatment options are available.[1]",Symptoms of common warts,"Common warts are easy to recognise and differentiate from other warts, such as genital, filiform or plantar warts. They typically appear on the hands or fingers, though can appear in any non-genital location. They are generally:[2]","
Small, raised skin growths
Oval or round in shape
Rough to the touch
Hard around the edges and softer in the middle
Speckled with small black dots
",Medical attention should be sought if:[3],"
Warts cause pain or change colour
Warts spread, do not respond to treatment or frequently recur
An individual has a weakened immune system
There is uncertainty as to whether the growths are common warts or a different condition
",Causes of common warts,"Common warts are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). There are over a hundred different types of HPV, each affecting one or several different areas of the body.","HPV infects the skin through small cuts, scrapes or weak spots, with the virus incubating for approximately two to six months before developing into warts. It causes the protein keratin to develop in excess on the surface of the skin.[4][5]","Common warts are particularly prevalent in children and young adults, as well as those with weakened immune systems as a result of conditions such as HIV/AIDS or organ transplantation.[4]","HPV is contagious and is passed on through direct skin-to-skin contact or indirect contact with objects or surfaces. Damaged or wet skin is most likely to pick up the virus, meaning locations such as swimming pools are particularly conducive to infection.[6]",Diagnosing common warts,"In the majority of cases, a doctor or dermatologist will be able to diagnose common warts through a simple physical examination. If further confirmation is needed, a skin biopsy may be ordered. To do this, the top layer of a wart will be scraped off and sent to a laboratory for testing. This is a straightforward and minimally invasive procedure.[7]",Common warts treatment,"Common warts will often disappear without treatment, especially in childhood. However, common warts can also be persistent and last for a significant amount of time. They can also be painful and unsightly, especially when they form in clusters. In these cases, treatment options are available.[8]","These treatment options may be used in conjunction with home treatment options, or when home treatment options have failed to remedy the condition. The method chosen by the doctor or dermatologist will depend on the severity of the warts, the symptoms and the general health of the individual.[9]","
Salicylic acid: This is a common method for treating warts. Salicylic acid works by gradually dissolving layers of the wart tissue, eventually resulting in total removal. It is generally applied to the wart as a gel or liquid. Though salicylic acid is also available in over-the-counter products, prescription varieties are typically stronger and more effective. Along with peeling away the surface of the warts, salicylic acid may also encourage the body’s immune system to combat the virus.
Cryotherapy: Generally performed by a doctor or dermatologist, cryotherapy is a method of freezing warts using liquid nitrogen. After around a week, the resulting dead tissue can be sloughed off. Repeated cryotherapy sessions may be necessary.
","If these options are ineffective, other, less common treatment methods may be used. These include:[10]","
Trichloroacetic acid: This is a strong acid applied by a doctor or dermatologist to the warts.[11]
Immunotherapy: Individuals are given antigens which encourage the body’s immune system to fight the wart itself. This treatment is generally reserved for those with recurring common warts.[12]
Electrosurgery: This method involves burning away the wart tissue using a specially designed heated needle. A local anesthetic will usually be required to numb the pain, and scarring is possible.
Laser treatment: A laser is used to burn off the skin tissue and remove the wart. It is generally considered to be a last resort option due to the likelihood of scarring and the extended recovery time.[13]
",Common warts home remedies,"Given that common warts are generally non-serious, some people may choose to try and treat them at home before seeking professional medical advice. Common techniques for doing this include:[14]","
Salicylic acid products: Non-prescription salicylic acid products – such as plasters, gels and rubs – are available from most pharmacies. These salicylic acid products work in the same way as the prescription version, though may be less powerful. Repeated application will generally be necessary.
Liquid nitrogen: Non-prescription liquid nitrogen products are generally available from pharmacies for application at home, usually in the form of a liquid or gel.
Apple cider vinegar: Mix a cup of apple cider vinegar with water, apply to the wart using a cotton ball and leave the warts to soak in the solution for at least 20 minutes. Repeat this process until the warts have disappeared.[15]
","It can take a significant amount of time before home remedies make a difference. If they prove ineffective, seeking professional medical advice is advised.",Common warts prevention,"It can be difficult to fully avoid contracting common warts, with most people experiencing them at some point in their life. However, certain preventative measures can help reduce the risk:[16]","
Avoid contact with other people’s warts
Avoid contact with clothing, objects or surfaces that may be carrying the virus
The HPV vaccine may reduce the risk of contracting the virus and developing common warts, though this is not guaranteed and may be most effective when received at a young age[17]
","If a person already has warts, they should take steps to avoid spreading the virus to other areas of the body. They can:","
Avoid unnecessarily touching or scratching the warts
Cover warts with a plaster, especially when swimming
Wash the hands regularly, especially after contact with the warts
Avoid sharing towels and clothing
",Common warts FAQs,"Q: Should I be concerned about common warts during pregnancy?
A: No, infection with HPV should not pose any risk to your baby. As in any case of common warts, no treatment may be necessary, though options are available over the counter and from doctors.[18]","Q: Are common warts contagious?
A: The virus that causes common warts, human papillomavirus (HPV), is contagious. Children and people with weakened immune systems are particularly at risk of contracting HPV, which can be passed on through skin-to-skin contact or through contact with an object or surface carrying the virus. The risk of contracting HPV is especially high in warm, wet conditions, such as those found at a swimming pool or in a locker room.[19]","Q: What is the difference between common warts and plantar warts?
A: Both common warts and plantar warts are a product of human papillomavirus (HPV). Unlike plantar warts, however, common warts may develop anywhere on the body, though most typically grow on the hands and fingers. Plantar warts are found on the feet only.[20]"

If symptoms occur after a blow to the head one should be assessed by a doctor and should be observed carefully for 24 hours for signs of a more severe brain injury. People who are unconscious for more than 5 minutes, who have severe memory loss, who have a discharge from their nose or black eyes without injury need urgent review by a doctor. People with concussion should rest until their symptoms settle. Concussion usually gets better within 1 to 2 days, but some people experience ongoing symptoms for up to 6 months.",Risks,"Concussion is a mild injury due to a blow to the head.

,,,,,,,,,,What is congenital hypothyroidism?
,,,,,,,,,,What is congenital hypothyroidism?,"Congenital hypothyroidism is a condition that can affect newborn babies. The word congenital means present at or before birth, while hypothyroidism refers to insufficient levels of thyroid hormone. While congenital hypothyroidism is a serious condition, it can generally be detected and treated early enough to prevent complications, thanks to routine screenings after birth in many parts of the world.[1][2][3]","The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland found in the lower part of the neck, just below the voice box. Hormones released by the thyroid control the body’s growth and metabolism. They affect key physical processes like heart rate, digestion, weight and temperature.[4] Adequate levels of thyroid hormone are essential for the healthy physical and mental development of a baby.[2]","Congenital hypothyroidism affects approximately 1 in every 2000 to 4000 newborns[5] and has been found to be more common in female babies.[1] The condition occurs when the baby’s thyroid gland does not develop or function properly. In the majority of cases, the gland itself is absent, smaller than normal or located in the wrong place. However, congenital hypothyroidism may also result when the gland is normal, but there are problems with the production of thyroid hormone.[6]","In the USA, UK and many other parts of the world, all newborn babies are screened for congenital hypothyroidism within a few days of birth. A simple heel-prick blood test is typically used, and if the results suggest the presence of congenital hypothyroidism, further tests will be done to confirm the diagnosis. Where necessary, treatment with synthetic thyroid hormone will be started without delay.[1][2][6][7]","If left untreated, congenital hypothyroidism can lead to severe, irreversible mental impairment and poor growth. However, with prompt, proper treatment and monitoring, the prognosis is excellent, and infants with congenital hypothyroidism will usually grow up to lead normal, healthy lives.[1][2][6][8]",Congenital hypothyroidism symptoms,Most newborn babies with congenital hypothyroidism show no obvious signs of the condition.[5] This may be because they receive some of their parent’s thyroid hormone before being delivered. They may also be able to produce a small amount of their own.[1][8],"However, some babies affected by congenital hypothyroidism may be less active, sleep a lot and be difficult to feed.[6][9] If congenital hypothyroidism is severe, the following signs and symptoms may also be present:[1][2][5][9]","
Weak cry
Poor feeding
Constipation
Dry skin
Poor muscle tone (floppiness)
Cold hands and feet; they may also be mottled
Prolonged jaundice (yellow skin)
Puffy face
Large tongue
Swollen stomach

Large fontanelles (the soft spots on a baby’s head)
",It is important that a newborn baby be screened for congenital hypothyroidism as early as possible in order to prevent complications.,"In many countries, babies are screened sufficiently soon after birth that they will generally not have symptoms of congenital hypothyroidism. However, in rare cases, a baby with the condition may have symptoms immediately after birth.[5]","In parts of the world where screening is not performed, a baby may not show symptoms of congenital hypothyroidism initially, but they will typically develop symptoms in the first few months after birth.[5] If you are concerned about any symptoms, you can do a free assessment using the Ada app.",Congenital hypothyroidism causes,"The most common cause of congenital hypothyroidism is the baby’s thyroid gland not developing properly. The gland may be absent, smaller than normal, or positioned in the wrong part of the neck. It is not known why this happens, but the malformation is not usually inherited – meaning that any siblings are unlikely to be born with the same thyroid condition.[2][3]",Other less-common causes of congenital hypothyroidism include:[1][2][3],"
Problems metabolizing thyroid hormone; this may be inherited
Problems with the hypothalamus or pituitary gland
Iodine deficiency in the parent during pregnancy, though this is uncommon in developed countries
Thyroid antibodies in the parent during pregnancy
Antithyroid medication taken during pregnancy (in a small number of cases)
","Excessive iodine intake, congenital liver hemangiomas (non-cancerous growths of blood vessels) and certain gene mutations may also be factors in the development of congenital hypothyroidism.[10]",Diagnosis of congenital hypothyroidism,"In many countries, all newborn babies are screened for congenital hypothyroidism, shortly after birth. This is done in hospital using a pinprick test that draws a small amount of blood, usually from the baby’s heel, to check their thyroid hormone levels. The baby will typically be checked for other conditions like cystic fibrosis and sickle cell disease at the same time.[1]","If the baby’s thyroid hormone levels are not within the acceptable range, a doctor will order further blood tests to confirm the diagnosis of congenital hypothyroidism. They may also request a thyroid ultrasound to be performed in order to assess the physical status of the thyroid gland. Treatment will be started immediately.[1][2]",Prevention of congenital hypothyroidism,"It is generally not possible to prevent congenital hypothyroidism.[9] However, pregnant people with a history of thyroid conditions, as well as those taking any medications or supplements, are advised to consult with medical practitioners before, during and after pregnancy in the interests of optimal health management.",Read about thyroiditis and other thyroid conditions »,Congenital hypothyroidism treatment,"Treatment for congenital hypothyroidism typically involves medication, monitoring and assessment of the baby’s development.[3]",Medication,"The standard treatment for congenital hypothyroidism is the prescription of synthetic thyroid hormone in the form of levothyroxine (L-T4). In many cases, it will be necessary to take levothyroxine for life.[2][9]","Levothyroxine comes in tablets, which should be crushed and given to the baby in a small amount of water or milk every day. A doctor will advise on the dose needed, as well as what foods to avoid giving the baby before and after taking the medication. It is important not to mix the tablets with soy formula or any preparation containing concentrated iron or calcium. When the child is older, they can swallow the tablets on their own with a cup of water. The dose will need to be adjusted as the child grows up.[5][9]","Prompt, proper treatment with levothyroxine can generally prevent complications from congenital hypothyroidism. The medication is generally considered safe and has no side-effects at the correct dose. If the dose is too low, symptoms of hypothyroidism may develop, while too high a dose can lead to symptoms of hyperthyroidism.[3]",Monitoring,"In many cases, a doctor will recommend working with a pediatric endocrinologist (a specialist in childhood conditions related to hormones) to help manage the baby’s congenital hypothyroidism as they grow up.[2][3][9]","The baby will need to have regular medical check-ups to make sure that their thyroid hormone levels are adequate for healthy growth and development. Regular blood tests will also be required. Until the baby is one year old, tests will usually be necessary every one to three months or more frequently. Thereafter, it may be possible to reduce the frequency of blood tests. A doctor will adjust the dose of levothyroxine as needed.[3][9]",Developmental assessment,"A doctor will also monitor the height, weight and overall growth and development of the child.[3] They will periodically assess the child’s language and communication skills, motor ability and behavior.[1] If it seems necessary, a doctor may recommend having the child’s development formally evaluated. Should there be any delays in speech or learning, an early intervention program can often be arranged to assist the child.[3]",Congenital hypothyroidism FAQs,"Q: Will a baby with congenital hypothyroidism grow up normally?
A: If a baby with congenital hypothyroidism is diagnosed and treated promptly and correctly, the prognosis is excellent. The child has a good chance of leading a normal, healthy life. If diagnosis and treatment is delayed, however, serious developmental problems may occur.[1][2][3][9]","In babies with severe congenital hypothyroidism, it is possible that there may be long-term neurocognitive (mental) effects. If treatment is not started promptly or the dosage or administering of levothyroxine is incorrect, the child may experience developmental delays.[3][8][9]","Q: Is levothyroxine safe for babies?
A: Yes. Levothyroxine is a synthetic version of the thyroid hormone produced by healthy thyroid glands. It is very effective and is considered safe to take every day, for babies, children and adults with hypothyroidism. However, it is important to check the baby’s thyroid levels regularly and adjust the dose of levothyroxine as needed, as too much levothyroxine can cause [symptoms of hyperthyroidism](symptoms of hyperthyroidism, while too little can lead to symptoms of hypothyroidism.[9] If you are concerned about any symptoms, you can do a free assessment using the Ada app.","Q: Does congenital hypothyroidism run in families?
A: In a small number of cases, congenital hypothyroidism is caused by an inherited condition.

Commonly known as pink eye, conjunctivitis is often caused by a virus (see viral conjunctivitis), bacteria (see bacterial conjunctivitis), allergies (see allergic conjunctivitis) or other non-infectious causes. Conjunctivitis is a common eye condition and is not usually serious.[1][2][3][4][5][6]","Good to know: Pink eye and styes are often confused. A stye or sty, is a small, red, painful bump on the edge of the eyelid, which develops when an oil gland becomes infected with bacteria. It may resemble a pimple or boil.[7][8]",General symptoms of conjunctivitis include:[1][2][3][4][5][6],"
Pinkness or redness of the eye, hence the name “pink eye”
Burning, itching, a sensation of grittiness, or mild pain or discomfort in the eye
Discharge from the eye; this may be watery or thick and pus-like, depending on the cause
Formation of a crust around the eye from discharge[9]
Swollen and/or reddened eyelids
","Depending on the type of conjunctivitis, other signs and symptoms may be present. One or both eyes may be affected by conjunctivitis. When only one eye is affected, it is called unilateral conjunctivitis. When both eyes are affected, it is called bilateral conjunctivitis. If you think that you may have conjunctivitis, you can use the Ada app to find out more about your symptoms.","Many cases of mild conjunctivitis clear up on their own, without specific treatment. Home remedies and over-the-counter (OTC) treatments may be useful. Cleaning the eyes with water and a clean cloth or sterile pad, applying warm or cool compresses and using lubricating eye drops, also known as artificial tears, may help to relieve symptoms. However, antibiotics, antiviral medication or allergy medication may be necessary in more serious cases of conjunctivitis.[1][2][3][4][5][6]","Most people make a full recovery from conjunctivitis, and the condition does not typically cause any complications. However, in a small number of cases, pink eye can be very serious, and may cause damage to the eyes if it is not treated effectively.","Conjunctivitis can affect people of any age, though bacterial conjunctivitis tends to be more common among children than adults.[4] Bacterial and viral conjunctivitis are highly contagious, which means that the infection can spread easily from one person to another. It is important that a person with infectious conjunctivitis take steps to avoid passing it on to others, such as practising good hygiene.",When to see a doctor for pink eye,Anyone with severe conjunctivitis symptoms should see a doctor immediately. These include:[4][6],"
Intense pain in the eye
Extreme redness in the eye
Inability to open the eye
Severe sensitivity to light
Blurred vision that persists after wiping away discharge
","If symptoms are mild but do not go away, medical advice should also be sought.","Furthermore, if conjunctivitis occurs in newborn babies or people with weakened immune systems, such as those who have HIV or are undergoing treatment for cancer, it can be very severe, and medical advice should be sought without delay.",Diagnosing conjunctivitis,"If symptoms are mild, a diagnosis of conjunctivitis can generally be made without seeing a doctor, and the condition can be managed at home with home remedies and OTC eye drops. However, if there is any uncertainty or concern over the condition, or the symptoms seem severe, seeing a doctor is very important.","A doctor will take the person’s medical history and examine their eyes to determine whether pink eye is present, and if so, what type of conjunctivitis it is. They will rule out other eye conditions like dry eye syndrome and more serious concerns such as uveitis and keratitis, which is an inflammation of the cornea, the front part of the eye. In some cases, laboratory tests may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.[1][3][5]",Types of conjunctivitis,There are three main types of conjunctivitis or pink eye:,Bacterial conjunctivitis,"Bacterial conjunctivitis is pink eye that is caused by infection with bacteria, e.g. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumonia, or, less commonly, the bacteria chlamydia (causing chlamydial conjunctivitis) and gonorrhea (causing gonococcal conjunctivitis), which are sexually transmitted infections (STIs).

It most commonly occurs in people with glaucoma.","Toxic conjunctivitis tends to be commonly caused by preservatives in eye medication, contact lens solutions and artificial tears.[13] A doctor can advise on the best treatment approach.",Conjunctivitis in newborn babies,"Newborn babies can be affected by various types of pink eye, including viral conjunctivitis and bacterial conjunctivitis, as well as irritant-caused conjunctivitis. Regardless of the cause, pink eye in infants is called neonatal conjunctivitis or ophthalmia neonatorum.","Babies with conjunctivitis usually develop puffy, red eyelids and discharge from the eyes within 1-14 days of birth.[4][14]","During the childbirth process, an infant’s eyes may become infected with a virus or bacteria from the mother. In some cases, this may be the bacteria linked to chlamydia and gonorrhea, or, rarely, the herpes simplex viruses that cause oral herpes and genital herpes.[14][15]","Silver nitrate solution, traditionally administered to a newborn’s eyes to prevent conjunctivitis, can actually cause irritant conjunctivitis. For this reason, many doctors now avoid using silver nitrate and use antibiotic eye drops instead. However, some babies may develop irritant conjunctivitis from the chemicals in these eye drops, too.[14][16][17]","Sometimes, a case of conjunctivitis in a baby is confused with sticky eyes caused by a blocked tear duct. However, a blocked tear duct will not cause the redness or swelling seen in conjunctivitis.[4]","Conjunctivitis in babies can be extremely serious, and any infant showing signs of conjunctivitis should be taken to a doctor immediately. Treatment with antibiotic, antiviral or other medication may be necessary, together with referral to an ophthalmologist.[15]",Conjunctivitis treatment,"In many cases, conjunctivitis in adults and children will clear up on its own, without specific treatment. To relieve discomfort, the following home remedies and over-the-counter treatments may be helpful:[1][3][4][18][19]","
Gently wiping discharge from the eye with a clean cloth, sterile pad or cotton wool soaked in water
Applying lubricating eye drops, called artificial tears, which are available without a prescription, to the eye
Applying a cold or warm compress – a clean cloth that has been soaked in water – to the eye
Avoiding rubbing the eyes, as this may aggravate symptoms
Avoiding the use of contact lenses and makeup until the conjunctivitis has cleared
In the case of allergic conjunctivitis, avoiding exposure to the allergen, e.g. dust
","In serious cases of conjunctivitis, prescription eye drops and other medicine, such as antihistamine tablets – for allergic conjunctivitis, antibiotics – for bacterial conjunctivitis, and antiviral medication – for viral conjunctivitis, may be recommended. Sometimes, a person will be referred to an eye specialist, an ophthalmologist, for treatment.","Good to know: Eye drops, including those used for the treatment of pink eye, have expiration dates set for a specific period after they are first opened. As the efficacy of the ingredients, including the preservatives, may be reduced after the expiry date and harmful bacteria may enter the container, it is important not to use eye drops after the expiration date. It is also important not to share eye drops with other people. Always follow the instructions provided with the eye drops regarding how to use them, as well as how to store them properly, which may include keeping them in a cool, dry place or in the fridge.[20][21]",Conjunctivitis (Pink eye) FAQs,"Q: Are conjunctivitis and pink eye the same thing?
A: Yes. Conjunctivitis is the medical term for the common eye condition known colloquially as pink eye or pinkeye.","Q: Is conjunctivitis contagious?
A: Whether conjunctivitis is contagious or not depends on the cause. Conjunctivitis caused by bacteria or a virus is highly contagious and can be spread easily from person to person. However, pink eye caused by allergies or irritants is not contagious and cannot be transmitted to other people.","Q: Is conjunctivitis airborne?
A: In some cases, it can be. For example, in the case of allergic conjunctivitis, the condition can be caused by airborne allergens such as pollen. In the case of viral conjunctivitis, it is possible that infection may occur by coming into contact with airborne droplets released when an affected person coughs or sneezes. In many cases of infectious conjunctivitis, however, it is spread by hand-to-eye contact or direct contact with a contaminated object, for example when other family members share towels or washcloths with an infected person.[22]","Q: Can conjunctivitis go away by itself?
A: Yes. In many cases, pink eye is mild and will clear up on its own without any specific treatment. However, in some cases, the condition can be severe and may require treatment with prescription medications. If you have any concerns about an eye condition, it is advisable to consult a doctor.","Q: Can pink eye cause a sore throat?
A: Pink eye itself cannot cause a sore throat. However, pink eye and sore throat may be two symptoms caused by infection with a cold virus, which is a common cause of conjunctivitis. There may also be a runny nose and other signs of a common cold.[23] While uncommon, a person can also experience strep throat and pink eye at the same time. The bacteria that cause strep throat can also cause conjunctivitis.[24]","Q: I have had conjunctivitis for several weeks. Do I need to see a doctor?
A: How long pink eye lasts often depends on the cause: most mild, uncomplicated cases of viral conjunctivitis and bacterial conjunctivitis clear up within 1-2 weeks. If symptoms do not improve after a few days or they get worse, or there is any confusion about what is causing eye symptoms, it is advisable to see a doctor as soon as possible. If antibiotic medicine has been prescribed for bacterial conjunctivitis and symptoms do not begin to improve after 24 hours, a doctor should also be seen.[3][25] If you are concerned, you can use the Ada app to find out more about your symptoms.",Associated terms used for conjunctivitis,"

The substance may be an allergen – something that provokes an allergic reaction – or an irritant – something that damages the skin.[1] Inflammation commonly results in red, itchy and cracked skin.[2]","Contact dermatitis is a common condition that is more likely to affect people who work with their hands, such as healthcare workers, hairdressers and some factory workers, especially when the work exposes the skin to possible irritants. It is generally a non-serious condition that will clear up with treatment.",Causes of contact dermatitis,"There are two types of contact dermatitis: irritant contact dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis. Of these, irritant contact dermatitis is the most common, accounting for roughly 80 percent of all cases.[1]","Irritant contact dermatitis occurs when the skin comes into contact with a substance that irritates the skin. Irritants come in many forms, and may include:[3]","
Prolonged exposure to water can cause skin irritation, especially if the water contains chlorine or is hard or chalky
Detergents, such as washing-up liquid, soap or bleach
Solvents, such as oil, petrol or chemicals found in the workplace
Acids and alkalis
Dust, soil and powders
Certain plants, such as clematis, hellebore and poison ivy
","The condition may develop following a single exposure to a very strong irritant, or develop from frequent exposure to a weaker irritant.","Allergic contact dermatitis occurs when the skin comes into contact with a specific substance which triggers an allergic reaction, known as an allergen. The allergen can be something the skin has newly been exposed to or something it has been exposed to many times before. Why some people develop allergic contact dermatitis and some do not is not entirely clear.[1][3]","A wide array of substances can cause an allergic reaction, though some of the most common include:[3]","
Nickel, a substance common in metal alloys used in everyday items such as jewellery, clothes and bra straps
Cobalt, a metal sometimes found in jewellery
Chromate, a metal sometimes found in cement
Cosmetics, such as perfumes, hair dyes and nail varnish
",Symptoms of contact dermatitis,"The symptoms of contact dermatitis occur on the part of the skin that has come into contact with the cause of the irritation. This is often the hands, face or areas of skin that have contact with clothing or jewellery.",Typical symptoms of contact dermatitis include:,"
Swelling
Itchy skin
A red, blotchy rash
Dry and scaly skin
Fluid-filled blisters
",Diagnosing contact dermatitis,Irritant contact dermatitis is diagnosed according to the person’s history of exposure to irritants and through an inspection of the symptomatic area of the skin.,"To diagnose allergic contact dermatitis, in addition to an examination of the affected area, a patch test will be carried out. This involves applying small patches containing common allergens to the skin, typically on the back, leaving them for a set amount of time – normally around two days – and then inspecting the results for signs of dermatitis. Following this, the dermatologist will be able to identify which allergen is responsible for the reaction.[4]",Contact dermatitis treatment,"Treating contact dermatitis will typically involve moisturizers, topical corticosteroids and/or steroid tablets. A dermatologist will be able to advise on the best course of treatment for each person.[5]",Moisturizers are often useful in the treatment of dry and scaly skin. A variety of different emollients are available – a dermatologist will be able to offer advice on which type is most suitable.[5],"Topical corticosteroids are steroid-containing creams and ointments that are applied directly to the affected skin. They can be effective in treating the redness and pain of dermatitis. Topical corticosteroids are available in a range of strengths, with the appropriate strength dependent on the severity and location of the dermatitis.[5]","In severe cases, particularly when the dermatitis covers a large area of skin, steroid tablets may be prescribed.[5] Always follow the instructions provided by the doctor when taking this kind of medication.","In mild cases, home remedies such as cool baths or cool, wet compresses may be effective in soothing the symptoms of contact dermatitis.",Contact dermatitis prevention,"Avoiding contact with the irritant or allergen that is causing contact dermatitis is the most effective way of preventing the condition. If total avoidance is not possible, creating a barrier between the substance and the skin – by wearing gloves, for example – is recommended. Carrying out a patch test before using new cosmetics or detergents, and using barrier creams may also help to prevent the onset of contact dermatitis.",Other names for contact dermatitis,"

In addition, the free Ada app can be used to carry out a symptom assessment.",Causes of conversion disorder,"Conversion disorder is believed to be an expression of psychologically stressful experiences. While many people experience physical changes related to their mindset, such as a racing heart when feeling nervous, people with conversion disorder tend to experience more dramatic symptoms when faced with psychological and emotional stress.",Examples of such emotions causing physical symptoms in people experiencing conversion disorder include:,"
A person suppressing anger and the desire to hit someone may experience numbness, tingling or paralysis of the arm
A person with a past history of traumatic experiences may experience seizures and loss of consciousness, due to suppressing memories of their experience(s)
","Conversion disorder is classified in the DSM-5[6] as a somatic symptom disorder, the symptoms of which were formerly known collectively as somatoform disorders. Somatization is a process in which psychological distress is converted into physical symptoms. Although there may be no medical or physical cause found to explain them, the symptoms are real, and affected people are encouraged to seek medical attention.",Diagnosis of conversion disorder,"Diagnosis is made by an experienced doctor or psychiatrist, based on based on discussions with the affected person about their life, feelings, and the history of their symptoms. It can be difficult to diagnose conversion disorder, and multiple tests are often performed to exclude other causes for the symptoms. A diagnosis is usually reached by process of elimination.","Tests are likely to concentrate on possible other causes for the neurological symptoms. One sign that a person has conversion disorder may be that symptoms differ from those of neurologic conditions. Key indicators that a person may be affected by conversion disorder, rather than a neurologic condition include:[3]","

,,,,,,,,,,What is coronary artery disease?
,,,,,,,,,,What is coronary artery disease?,"Coronary heart disease is a condition where the arteries which supply the heart become hardened and narrowed over time. This results in a decreased supply of blood and oxygen to the heart muscle (myocardium). This can cause serious complications, such as heart attacks and heart failure. It usually has a slow onset. The main symptom is chest pain or pressure that can radiate to the jaw, shoulder, back or arm. Treatment depends on the severity of symptoms, and involves managing other health conditions, making lifestyle changes, using medications and in some cases undergoing a procedure to widen the blood vessels of the heart. These treatments can help to prevent severe consequences.",Risks,"Coronary artery disease is slightly more common in men than women, and is most common in middle-aged and older adults. Important risk factors are diabetes, high blood pressure, smoking, drinking alcohol, obesity and having a family member who has coronary artery disease.",Symptoms,"Symptoms of coronary artery disease include angina (short-lived episodes of chest pain) and shortness of breath. Angina is usually brought on by exercise, and gets better with rest. Some people may experience angina whilst resting. The chest pain is often in the center of the chest, and may spread to the arm and jaw. Some people might also have nausea, a cold sweat, dizziness or fainting spells.",Diagnosis,"Diagnosis is based on the symptoms and physical examination. An electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) may show signs of heart muscle damage, and an exercising ECG/EKG may show heart damage that only occurs when exercising. Blood tests for cholesterol levels and blood sugar levels can also be helpful. Cardiac angiography, where dye is injected into the heart blood vessels and x-rays are taken, may help identify areas of narrowing or blockage in the heart arteries. Rarely, a magnetic resonance image (MRI) can be performed on the heart to examine the vessels.",Treatment,"Treatment depends on the specific symptoms and their severity. For people with mild, predictable chest pain symptoms, treatment involves thinning the blood to prevent blockages, and taking a medication to help open up the blood vessels when there is pain present. As the condition progresses, it might be necessary to have cardiac catheterization (insertion of a tube through the leg blood vessels into the heart blood vessels) to widen narrowed or blocked blood vessels with a stent (a small wire cage). Eventually, some people may need bypass surgery.",Prevention,"Preventing coronary artery disease involves lifestyle and diet changes. Being physically active, losing weight, ceasing to smoke and excluding alcohol from the diet can all help.

,,,,,,,,,,What is cradle cap?
,,,,,,,,,,What is cradle cap?,"Cradle cap is a common skin disorder affecting newborn babies, usually those younger than three months of age. It is also known as infant seborrheic dermatitis or infantile seborrheic dermatitis. It is generally not uncomfortable for the infant, except in severe cases when it may be itchy.[1]","What causes cradle cap is not entirely certain, but it may be the result of overactive oil-producing sebaceous glands, which are stimulated by the mother’s hormones.[2] These glands produce sebum, an oily or waxy substance that lubricates and waterproofs the skin.","Another factor contributing to cradle cap may be the colonization of the sebaceous glands by natural yeasts,[2] specifically particular subspecies of the genus Malassezia[3] It is possible that these yeasts do not cause cradle cap, but rather take advantage of the overproduction of sebum that is already happening.[4]","It is also likely that stress, chemical irritants and dry, cold weather may play a role in causing cradle cap.[1] Cradle cap is not caused by allergies, lack of hygiene or lack of care.[1] It is not contagious.[2]",Cradle cap can be treated quite easily and will usually clear up within a few weeks or months.[5],Symptoms of cradle cap,"Cradle cap usually occurs on the parts of the body that have the highest density of sebaceous glands, such as:[1][2]","
The scalp
The face, around the nose, chin and mouth
The forehead, the back of the ears or the back of the neck
In other skin folds, for example in the armpits, inner elbows and backs of the knees
The buttocks and gluteal cleft (the diaper area)
","Cradle cap usually manifests as an oily, flaky crust on the baby’s scalp. However, the appearance of cradle cap can vary. It may also present as:[1][2][3]","
Mild, patchy scales
Extensive, thick scaly patches
Thick, oily yellow scales
Brown crusting patches
Red skin surrounded by pink patches - more common in skin folds
Swollen areas of skin - more common in skin folds.
","Cradle cap is not the result of an infection and should not feel hot to the touch, itch, smell or weep fluids. If the infant’s rash itches, feels warm, smells bad or weeps fluids, infection may have occurred,[1] and medical help should be sought.","Cradle cap is most common in babies younger than six months of age and often appears within the first few weeks of life. It does not usually persist once the baby is older than nine months of age. In older children, symptoms resembling those of cradle cap may instead suggest:[4]","
Atopic dermatitis
Impetigo
Psoriasis
Contact dermatitis
Ringworm
","Good to know: Atopic and contact dermatitis, impetigo, psoriasis and ringworm, which are also common skin conditions in babies and young children, can be easily distinguished from cradle cap as they are all itchy. Cradle cap is not usually itchy unless it is very severe.","Cradle cap can spread to the diaper area, but diaper rash is a separate condition, which manifests as irritated, tender and red skin. This is caused by the infant’s skin coming into contact with a diaper that is soiled by urine or feces.[6] Babies with diaper rash tend to be irritable because of the discomfort.[7] For more information, see this resource on diaper rash.",Treatment of cradle cap,"Mild cradle cap can be treated with easily available remedies like petroleum jelly, baby shampoo, almond or olive oil, baby oil and coal tar shampoo. In most cases, monitoring and home remedies suffice. However, if the rash bleeds, weeps fluid, is hot to the touch or spreads extensively, the infant should be taken to the doctor. More severe cases respond well to:[8]","
Topical steroids such as hydrocortisone
Antifungals such as ketoconazole or imidazole.
","One way to treat cradle cap is to warm a small amount of clean, natural oil such as jojoba, almond or olive oil, and massage it into the area affected by cradle cap. After 15 minutes, the flakes can be gently brushed off. The area should then be thoroughly shampooed, with special care taken to ensure that no oil remains on the skin.[2] Flakes can be brushed from the skin by gently using a soft brush or terry cloth towel.","Good to know: There is some controversy about the efficacy of olive oil in the treatment of cradle cap. Some studies have shown that olive oil disturbs the natural skin barrier, but others have cast doubt on this.[4]","White petroleum jelly can be applied daily and is known to soften scales, which can then be brushed off. Regular washing with baby shampoo is also useful.[3] In some cases, coal tar shampoo may be used, but this can sometimes irritate the skin. The same is true for shampoos devised to control dandruff; as these can sting, they are not very suitable for use on babies.[8]","Hydrocortisone, imidazole or ketoconazole are all available as prescription creams or gels for use in the treatment of severe cases of cradle cap. Imidazole or ketoconazole creams are applied several times a week, while hydrocortisone cream is applied daily.[9]"

When this inflammation develops, the affected person will typically experience debilitating symptoms, which may include bowel obstructions, nausea, chronic diarrhea and abdominal pain.","Most commonly, the inflammation within the digestive system which occurs in Crohn’s disease affects sections of the terminal ileum ‒ the final segment of the small intestine ‒ and/or the colon ‒ the large intestine ‒ but it can affect any of the gastrointestinal organs.","Crohn’s disease usually develops in adulthood but can, in some cases, manifest in childhood or adolescence.[1] It is a lifelong, chronic condition.",People affected by Crohn’s disease experience periods of:,"
Remission, in which the disease is inactive and the individual is without symptoms
Flare-ups, in which the disease is active and symptoms are present
",Treatment for Crohn’s disease aims to alleviate the symptoms and prolong periods of remission.,Symptoms,A person who is affected by Crohn’s disease may experience a wide range of symptoms which may also vary in severity.,Common symptoms of Crohn’s disease include:[2],Digestive discomfort,"This takes the form of abdominal pain and cramping and often occurs one or two hours after eating, but may occur at any time. People with Crohn’s disease often avoid eating or eat less in order to avoid digestive discomfort, which can lead to weight loss. Digestive discomfort is usually at its worst when an individual is experiencing a flare-up of the disease.[3]",Diarrhea,This is one of the main symptoms of Crohn’s disease and happens when the gut cannot absorb all the necessary fluid from food during the digestive process. This often creates a sense of urgency and needing to rush to the toilet.[4],Fatigue,"A high percentage of people with Crohn’s disease are affected by fatigue.[5] This may be caused by lack of sleep, which in people with Crohn’s disease is common due to digestive discomfort, high stress levels, depression and using medication of which insomnia and/or discomfort are side effects.[6]","Fatigue may also be caused by malnutrition which is a common consequence of Crohn’s disease, as the inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract can result in a less efficient uptake of the essential compounds derived from food, which the body needs in order to function properly. People with Crohn’s disease are commonly found to be deficient in iron, vitamin B12 and vitamin D.[7] These deficiencies often correlate to a loss in muscle strength.[8] If you or a loved one is feeling tired for unknown reasons, you get a free symptom assessment by downloading the Ada app.",Blood in one’s stools,"Crohn’s disease typically causes bleeding in the lower digestive tract, which manifests as bright red blood in one’s stools. The condition may also cause bleeding in the colon, associated with inflammation, anal fissures and fistulas.[9]",Mucus in one’s stools,"A healthy intestine produces a certain amount of mucus in order to protect and lubricate the bowel area. When a person is affected by Crohn’s disease, the production of mucus can increase, resulting in surplus mucus emerging with one’s stools. This usually takes the form of a gel-like material which appears to coat the stool.[10]",Unintentional weight loss,"Due to avoiding certain foods or food groups and failing to absorb sufficient energy from one’s food as a result of malabsorption and diarrhea, people with Crohn’s disease frequently experience weight loss.",Other symptoms,Less common symptoms of Crohn’s disease include:[2],"
Nausea and vomiting
High temperature and/or being prone to fevers
Swelling and pain in the joints
Mouth ulcers
Skin irritation involving redness, swelling and itching
Uveitis, i.e. red and irritated eyes
",Causes,"Approximately 1.6 million people in the U.S. are affected by either Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis, the other prominent form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).[11] The exact reasons why Crohn’s disease develops in people are unknown, but it is believed to be the result of an interaction of possible factors.","When it encounters environmental or genetic factors, or a combination of the two, the immune system can be triggered, resulting in the inflammation associated with Crohn’s disease.","Foreign substances (antigens) which one encounters, particularly those related to smoking tobacco and to one’s diet, may irritate and cause inflammation in the intestines, resulting in the development of Crohn’s disease. Alternatively, these stimuli may correlate to an autoimmune response, whereby the body’s immune system causes areas of the gastrointestinal system to become inflamed.",Risk factors,"Anyone can be affected by Crohn’s disease, but it is most likely to manifest in people between the ages of 10 and 40.",Factors which increase one’s risk of experiencing Crohn’s disease include:,"
Being of European descent, in particular of Ashkenazi Jewish origin)[12]
Smoking tobacco[13]
Being female[14]
Genetic factors; having an affected family member is a significant risk factor for developing Crohn’s disease, but the exact inheritance pattern for the condition is unknown
",Diagnosis,"People often experience the symptoms of Crohn’s disease for many years before being diagnosed with the condition. In order to establish a diagnosis of Crohn’s disease, doctors will consider a person’s medical history and symptoms and will also perform a physical examination. They will often also conduct laboratory studies and further tests in order to establish the nature and severity of the condition.",Diagnostic techniques for Crohn’s disease include:[15],Medical history survey,"Doctors will make a full survey of the affected person’s medical history, including when their symptoms began, their dietary habits, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), history of smoking and whether they have a family history of Crohn’s disease or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Doctors will pay particular attention to noting whether they have been affected by appendicitis.",Physical examination,"This will take into account an individual’s height, weight, sex, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), and will include a digital-rectal examination, an examination of the abdomen, as well as a survey of the eyes, joints, heartbeat, lungs, back, pulse, and the skin and muscles, where extraintestinal symptoms of Crohn’s disease may be found.",Laboratory studies,"These will be performed in order to test one’s levels of electrolytes and creatinine, and a full blood count (FBC) test will be carried out to detect infection and anemia. Tests will also be performed to establish one’s levels of nitrogen, bilirubin, transferrin vitamin B12 and folic acid. Doctors will also prescribe tests to determine the individual’s erythrocyte sedimentation rate (the rate at which red blood cells coagulate), liver function tests and a urine strip to test for irregularities in the content of their urine.",Imaging studies,"Imaging techniques such as MRI and CT scans will be used to screen extraintestinal symptoms such as fistulas, abscesses or sclerosing cholangitis (liver disease). People who are suspected of having Crohn’s disease will often undergo an ileocolonoscopy, in which a tube-like device containing a camera is passed through the colon in order to examine the ileum, and/or an esophagogastroduodenoscopy, in which the tube-like device is swallowed in order to examine problems relating to the upper gastrointestinal tract.","If it is not possible to scan the terminal ileum using conventional imaging studies, a wireless capsule endoscopy may be prescribed, which involves swallowing a small device containing a camera. This is often used to investigate unexplained bleeding in the gastrointestinal area.[16]",Biopsy samples,"Biopsy samples will be taken from at least five segments of the gastrointestinal tract will be taken during the esophagogastroduodenoscopy in order to investigate the extent of the inflammation, and the inflammatory cell infiltrate, lymphocytes and plasma cells.",Stool samples,"Stool samples will be taken to test for the presence of bacteria called Clostridium difficile, which cause diarrhea and gastrointestinal conditions.",Microbial studies,"These studies will be performed via stool samples to identify the microorganisms, including pathogens and members of the indigenous microbiota, which may be present in an individual’s gastrointestinal system and which may initiate or propagate the inflammatory process characteristic of Crohn’s disease.[17]","The testing process to determine a definitive diagnosis of Crohn’s disease is thorough. This is due to the fact that the condition is one of many, which are associated with pain and cramping in the abdomen.",Differential diagnosis,"Conditions which are often confused with Crohn’s disease, and which will be ruled out during the course of the diagnostic process include:","
Stomach ulcers
Gastritis (stomach irritation)
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which has similar symptoms to Crohn’s disease, but is a much less serious condition, which does not result in damage to the intestine
Gastrointestinal reflux disease (GERD)
Appendicitis
Ulcerative colitis, the other main form of inflammatory bowel disease
","The final step in the diagnosis of Crohn’s disease involves collecting information to devise a treatment plan for the affected individual. This assessment will be performed by a doctor specialising in diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, called a gastroenterologist.",This initial assessment will establish:[18],"
The extent of the disease
Complications such as fistulae and stricturing
Nutritional status and deficiencies
Bone density and the corresponding risk of conditions such as osteoporosis
",Treatment,"There is currently no cure for Crohn’s disease, but there are many treatment options available to alleviate the symptoms. Treatment for Crohn’s disease focuses on:","
Treating the symptoms
Minimising flare ups
Maintaining periods of remission
","With effective treatment, many people with Crohn’s disease will experience significant periods, possibly several years, without symptoms. For people with more severe forms of the condition, and for whom medications do not provide significant relief from the symptoms, surgery may be required.",Steroid medication,"Initial treatment of Crohn’s disease will usually involve the prescription of steroid medications (corticosteroids), which are used to reduce inflammation. These may take the form of tablets or injections, depending on what is determined to be suitable for the affected individual.[19]","However, long-term usage of corticosteroids is associated with problematic side effects, which may include:","
Swelling of the face
Unwanted weight gain
Increased susceptibility to infections
Bone density loss and resultant osteoporosis
","When a person embarks on a course of corticosteroid medication, an aim of this treatment will usually be to reduce the dose over time, so as to minimise one’s exposure to harmful side effects.","Good to know: As an alternative to corticosteroids, some people may be prescribed a milder steroid or a type of medication called a 5-aminosalicylate. However, these tend to be less effective at alleviating gastrointestinal inflammation.",Polymeric diet,"For individuals, whose growth and development may have been affected by Crohn’s disease, a polymeric (liquid) diet administered through a nasogastric tube may be recommended as an initial treatment. Many studies have been undertaken, comparing the polymeric diet to steroid medication, and it is considered an equally effective first-line treatment for Crohn’s disease.[20]","A polymeric diet will be prescribed in order to allow the digestive system to recover from being inflamed and to support the uptake of nutrients, a process which is often compromised by the inflammation that is characteristic of Crohn's disease.[20]","A person who has been prescribed a polymeric diet will progress to slowly reintroducing solid foods into their diet in a controlled setting, in order to safeguard the period of remission facilitated by undertaking the liquid diet.[21]",Immunosuppressants,"If a person, who is being treated with corticosteroids or the polymeric diet, experiences a flare up of their symptoms twice or more during one year, or finds that they return when their steroid dose is reduced, medicines which suppress the immune system (immunosuppressants) may be prescribed in combination with the initial course of treatment.",The immunosuppressant medications which are most commonly prescribed for the treatment of Crohn’s disease are azathioprine and mercaptopurine. They work by damping down the over-activity of the cells within the immune system.[22] An alternative immunosuppressant medication is methotrexate. Methotrexate is not recommended for use during pregnancy.,"It is vital that a blood test is performed before immunosuppressant medication is prescribed. A high score on this test relating to factors such as an elevated white blood cell count and increased lymph production, may indicate immunosuppressant toxicity, which means that these medications are not suitable for the affected individual.[23]","People who are using immunosuppressant medication in the treatment of Crohn’s disease will undergo regular blood tests in order to ensure that the medication continues to agree with them, so that their use can be discontinued if needed, averting the presence of unwanted side effects.Possible side effects of immunosuppressant medication include:","
Nausea and vomiting
Susceptibility to infection
Inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis)
Liver problems
Anemia, characterised by feeling tired, breathless and weak
",Biologic therapies,"Biologic therapies are a type of immunosuppressant medications which use substances, such as antibodies and enzymes, to inhibit the effects of Crohn’s disease.","The development of biologic therapies therefore presents a breakthrough alternative treatment option for those who are unwilling or unable to use steroid medication. Historically, people with Crohn’s disease and other types of IBD faced a lack of effective treatment options. Corticosteroid therapy does not alleviate the symptoms of Crohn’s disease in all cases and for those whose symptoms do not respond to it, prolonged systemic corticosteroid therapy and surgery were previously the only options.[24]","If a person responds well to biologic therapy, its benefits may include:","
Removal of the need to use steroid medication, thereby avoiding its side effects
Prolonged periods in which the disease is in remission
Potential delay or negation of the need for surgery to redress intestinal damage caused by Crohn’s disease
",Why is biologic therapy not always offered as a first-line treatment?,"Medical opinion is divided as to whether biologic therapies should be a first-line treatment option, and many doctors prefer to investigate whether a case of Crohn’s disease can be treated with corticosteroids, a liquid diet or traditional immunosuppressants initially, before considering biologic therapy.","The principal reason that some doctors prefer to prescribe traditional treatment methods first is that less is understood about the mechanism of action of biologic medications, and how different people will respond to them. Allergic reactions to the medications used in biologic therapies may occur –immediately or months after stopping treatment – and these can be life-threatening.",Methods of administration,The two medications used in biologic therapy for Crohn’s disease are Infliximab and Adalimumab.,"These medications are considered to be broadly comparable in terms of their effectiveness in bringing about prolonged periods of remission and preventing the development of complications, such as intestinal obstructions, which require surgery.[25] Both children and adults can be prescribed Infliximab but Adalimumab is only suitable for adults.","Both medications are usually prescribed on a twelve month course. After this, the need to continue will be reviewed, based on the individual’s response and the stability of the periods of remission following dosing.",Infliximab is administered as an infusion via a drip into a vein and requires one to visit a hospital to receive the medication as an outpatient procedure.,"Adalimumab can be administered as an injection and one can learn to do this independently or with the help of another person, meaning that hospital visits are not necessary in order to redose. Doctors will advise on the type of medication that is appropriate in each individual case of Crohn’s disease.",Surgery,The type of surgical procedure which will be prescribed in this case is called a resection. Doctors will consider performing a resection to remove the inflamed sections of the intestinal tract in cases where the symptoms of Crohn’s disease have not been alleviated by other treatments.,"A resection is a major procedure and usually performed under general anaesthetic. When the inflamed sections of the intestine have been removed, the healthy sections will be stitched together.",Ileostomy (temporary or permanent),"An ileostomy is a procedure which involves diverting one’s digestive waste away from the colon in order to give the area, which has undergone a resection, a chance to heal.[26] This can be temporary or permanent.","The type of ileostomy prescribed as an adjunct to a resection is usually a loop ileostomy, a temporary version of ileostomy, performed under general anaesthetic, which will be reversed after the body has had a chance to recover from undergoing resection surgery.[27]","In a loop ileostomy, an opening in the lower abdominal area, called a stoma, is surgically created. An ileostomy bag, also called a colostomy bag or pouch, is then attached to the small intestine through the stoma. The bag hangs outside the body and collects the waste products that would otherwise have passed into one’s large intestine and out of one’s rectum.[27] Normal function of the digestive system will be restored when the ileostomy is reversed.",A loop ileostomy is not always necessary as an accompaniment to a resection. One’s physician will advise on whether the procedure is needed.,Management,"A person's lifestyle, exercise routine and diet plan will generally need to be tailored to their individual needs as determined by their condition, and may need to be adjusted according to their symptoms.",Managing Crohn’s disease can involve:,"
Maintaining periods of remission
Making lifestyle adjustments to accommodate medical appointments
Management of pain and digestive discomfort
Co-ordinating an appropriate lifestyle whilst undergoing treatment
Surgery aftercare
","Changing one’s diet after surgery may be necessary. A potential outcome of surgery for Crohn’s disease is short bowel syndrome, a condition in which malabsorption occurs due to lack of a functional small intestine. Short bowel syndrome, when present, develops in the recovery period after an intestinal resection. The likelihood of a person developing problems associated with malabsorption increases, the more intestinal tissue is removed.","In order to ensure that the affected person receives as much nutritional benefit from their food as possible, doctors will advise on the most appropriate food plan for each person, in order to reduce the chances of vitamin and mineral deficiencies after surgery.",Lifestyle adaptations,"Crohn’s disease is a chronic condition, which means that one must make certain adjustments to one’s lifestyle, including accepting that treatment and management of the condition will always be a part of one’s life. One may find it helpful to educate one’s loved ones and co-workers about the condition, so that they are understanding when one has to miss commitments or take time off work due to a flare-up.","People with Crohn’s disease will undergo periods when they need to attend frequent medical appointments for tests and/or treatment, and even when one is in a period of remission, one may need to attend checkups and periodic screenings for conditions, such as bowel cancer and osteoporosis, for which Crohn’s disease is a risk factor. It is therefore important to establish a good working relationship with one’s gastroenterologist.","Travelling with Crohn’s disease will require advance planning in order to ensure that one has, or is able to access, the pharmaceuticals that one is using to manage the condition. It is recommended that one identifies in advance how to seek medical attention in one’s destination location in the event of a flare-up.","Knowing the location of nearby restrooms can be helpful to people with Crohn’s disease as one is prone to diarrhea and may need to access a restroom rapidly. Checking the location of public restrooms in advance when visiting a new area is recommended, in order to ensure that toilets are accessible when needed.",Exercise,"It is important for everybody to engage in a certain amount of physical activity in order to maintain a healthy body. This includes people who are affected by Crohn’s disease. However, inflammation, fatigue and urgency are all factors which mean that an individual with Crohn’s disease will need to identify the appropriate fitness plan for them. Physical activity which is too intense may exacerbate the inflammation in people affected by Crohn’s disease.","There has not been significant research into the ideal types and intensities of physical activity for different levels of severity of Crohn’s disease. However, a recent review of current research suggests that a personalized exercise plan would be ideal.[28]",This should be devised taking into account factors such as:[28],"
Age
Fitness level
Exercise goals
Preferences
Severity of one’s Crohn’s disease and associated needs, such as proximity to restrooms
","The types of activity which have been found convenient and helpful for people with Crohn’s disease, include:[28]","
Aerobic activity, especially walking
Muscular resistance training, which can be carried out at home, if necessary
",Diet,"There is currently no dietary template to follow in order to minimize the symptoms of Crohn’s disease. Individuals react differently to different foodstuffs, and everybody will find it helpful to avoid particular foods, which appear to aggravate their symptoms.","However, there are some general principles which are widely acknowledged to be helpful in preventing flare-ups of Crohn’s disease symptoms, including:","
Eating smaller meals which are easier to digest
Drinking plenty of water
Keeping a food diary to ensure a balanced diet and to track adverse reactions to particular foods
Monitoring one’s fiber intake to discern whether high-fiber products trigger one’s symptoms
Choosing low-fat products
Avoiding foods which produce excessive bloating and gas
",Complications from Crohn’s disease,"In addition to experiencing the immediate symptoms of Crohn’s disease, people with the condition are also predisposed to further health complications.Related conditions which commonly affect people with Crohn’s disease include:",Intestinal obstruction,"This condition is also referred to as bowel obstruction. Over time, the inflammation of the digestive tract in people with Crohn’s disease can cause the wall of the affected area(s) of the small or large intestine to thicken permanently. This can cause the intestine to become blocked. Intestinal obstructions can be fatal if left untreated and often require surgical removal.[29]",Anal fissure,"This is a tear or sore which can occur in the anal canal. Anal fissures are common in people with Crohn’s disease, due to the trauma which is caused to the area by frequent bowel movements.[30]",Anal abscess,"An anal abscess is an infected cavity filled with pus. Abscesses can affect the anus or rectum as a result of the internal glands in the anus becoming infected. This is likely to occur in people with Crohn’s disease, as the tissue in this area is often traumatized due to frequent bowel movements.[31]",Fistulae,"The inflammation caused by Crohn’s disease often creates ulcers, leaks and abscesses in the bowel wall. The more severe the inflammation, the more likely it is that one of these abrasions will develop into a hole, which then forms a fistula. A fistula is a tunnel which forms between two parts of the bowel or between the bowel and the outer skin or between the bowel and other surrounding hollow areas or organs, such as the bladder or vagina, which are not normally connected to the bowel.[32]","The larger a fistula is, the more likely it is to become infected. This can cause problems like irritation of the skin and leakage of feces into or from the space which has been connected to the bowel.[32] If you suspect you may have this condition, you can get a free symptom assessment by downloading the Ada app.",Iron deficiency anaemia,"This condition often occurs in people with Crohn’s disease, due to the bleeding in the digestive tract, and because malabsorption can cause a person’s iron levels to become deficient. It is associated with shortness of breath, fatigue and a pale complexion.[33]",Read more about Ireon Deficiency Anemia »,Osteoporosis,"Osteoporosis is a disorder of the skeleton, in which the structure of the bones becomes porous. This can lead to the bones becoming weak, fragile and prone to painful fractures (breaks). In people with Crohn’s disease, osteoporosis can occur due to the intestines failing to absorb sufficient nutrients to support healthy bone growth, or due to the use of steroid medication, which may be used in the treatment of Crohn’s disease.",Read more about Osteoporosis »,Vitamin B12 deficiency,"Often signalled by fatigue and a lack of energy, vitamin B12 deficiency is likely to occur in people with Crohn’s disease due to malabsorption.",Read more about Vitamin B12 Deficiency »,Pyoderma gangrenosum,"This is a treatable, non-infectious skin condition,[34] characterised by painful ulcers, which typically develop purple or blue edges, and may ooze fluid. They most commonly occur on the legs.",Hypercoagulability,"People affected by Crohn’s disease are at an increased risk of blood clots forming, which may result in deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or a pulmonary embolism if left untreated. The link between hypercoagulability and Crohn’s disease is not yet fully understood, but recent research suggests that imbalances between the levels of clotting and thinning agents in the blood caused by inflammation from Crohn’s disease, contributes to the development of the condition.[35]",Colorectal cancer,People whose Crohn’s disease affects their colon have a slightly increased risk of developing colorectal cancer. It is advisable to attend regular checkups and to undergo a colonoscopy to screen for colon cancer.,"People with Crohn’s disease are advised to attend regular medical checkups in general, which should assist with the early identification and treatment of any associated conditions that arise.",Read more about colorectal cancer »,Pregnancy and fertility,"People who are affected by Crohn’s disease can normally follow their usual treatment plan during pregnancy. Most of the medications and treatment protocols, which are normally prescribed for people with Crohn’s disease, are suitable for pregnant women, with the exception of methotrexate, a type of immunosuppressant medication.[36]","Regarding the development of the fetus, Crohn’s disease has been associated with the following possible risks:[36]","
Low birth weight
Preterm delivery
Stillbirth
Small gestational age
","It is strongly recommended that both men and women with Crohn’s disease be in a period of remission at the point of conception. This will maximize the likelihood that the pregnancy will progress with no complications, and that the fetus will develop healthily.[37]",Crohn’s disease FAQs,"Q: Does Crohn’s disease reduce one’s life expectancy?
A: In many cases, people with Crohn’s disease are able to live a normal lifespan, due to the extent to which treatments are now successfully able to mitigate the symptoms of Crohn’s disease.[38]","Q: How is Crohn’s disease different from ulcerative colitis?
A: Ulcerative colitis is the other main form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and shares several important characteristics with Crohn’s disease. They are both chronic (long-term) conditions which involve inflammation of the gut and fatigue. However, ulcerative colitis only affects the large intestine, whereas Crohn’s disease can affect any part of the gastrointestinal system.[39]","The two conditions differ in their symptoms. People with Crohn’s disease may produce stools containing mucus, blood and/or undigested fats, whereas stool samples from people with ulcerative colitis are more likely to contain only mucus and/or blood. Tenesmus (rectal pain) is more characteristic of ulcerative colitis than Crohn’s disease, whereas fistulae and weight loss are more likely to occur in cases of Crohn’s disease. It is common for someone with Crohn’s disease to experience regular fevers,[40] whereas this would be symptomatic of a severe flare-up in someone with ulcerative colitis.[41]","Q: Is there a cure for Crohn’s disease?
A: There is not currently a cure for Crohn’s disease. However, many people with the condition are able to achieve periods of remission, which last years or even decades due to accessing effective treatment options. With regard to developing a cure, a recent study has built on existing research into available treatments for Crohn’s disease. The findings suggest that alternative mechanisms, which can permanently intercept the workings of the disease, may be developed by 2030.[42]"
,,,,,,,,,,What is cryptorchidism?
,,,,,,,,,,What is cryptorchidism?,"Cryptorchidism is also known as undescended testicles (UDT), or undescended testes, and is usually medically defined as a condition in which a testis is not in the scrotum and doesn’t descend into the scrotum by the time the baby is four months old.[1] It is the most common congenital abnormality of the male genitalia[2] and affects about three in every ten male infants born prematurely.[3] Between one and six percent of all male babies are affected. Usually, the condition is unilateral, affecting only one testis. Rarely, the disorder is bilateral, affecting both testes.[1][4] Most cases are idiopathic, which means that the cause is unknown.[5]","Cryptorchidism is not painful for the infant, and in eight out of ten cases it resolves without medical intervention. Most cases of cryptorchidism are diagnosed during the routine checks that the baby undergoes at birth. The others are usually diagnosed during infancy, childhood or early adolescence.[4]",The development of the testicles,"The testicles develop in two main phases while in utero. The first phase, which is controlled by male hormones known as androgens, occurs between the eighth and 15th weeks of gestation.[6] During this phase, the testicles develop, but are held in the fetus’s abdominal cavity by a ligament that allows very little movement.[4][6] It is relatively rare for complications to happen during this phase.","The second phase takes place between 25 and 35 weeks of gestation, when the testicles begin to migrate towards the scrotum.[7] Most cases of cryptorchidism develop in this phase.[6] However, in the vast majority of infant males, both testicles are present in the scrotal sac at birth.","In approximately 80 percent of cases of cryptorchidism, one or both scrotal sacs are empty at birth.[4] In most cases where the testes have not descended by the time the baby is born, they will have descended by the age of three months, due a postnatal surge in testosterone levels. However, if they have not done so by the time the baby is six months old, it is unlikely that they will do so on their own.[1]",There are various forms of cryptorchidism:,"
Arrested testicle: one or both testes stay in the inguinal canal (85% of cases), abdomen, or retroperineum.[8]
Ectopic testicle: in which one or both testes descend normally but are diverted to an aberrant position.
Absent testicle: in which the testis does not develop.
Ascending testicle: in which the testes are originally in a normal scrotal position, and then “ascend” and become undescended. This can require surgery to correct.
","There is also a special form, known as retractile testes, in which the testes are pulled up out of the scrotum. They can usually be manipulated back into the scrotum. Retractile testes are quite common and no reason for concern. For more information, see section below.",Retractile testes,"In some cases, what appears to be an undescended testicle may in fact be a retractile or ascended testicle. These tend to be more common in older children than they are in infants.","A retractile testis occurs when the cremasteric reflex is oversensitive, and generally does not need treatment as the testis is otherwise present and descended. A retracted testis can usually be manipulated back into the scrotum and remain there without being held in place. The condition is usually resolved completely by the time puberty begins.[9] Boys with this condition need to be monitored for ascending testes, but there is usually no cause for concern.","In cases where the testicles do not descend into the scrotum of their own accord, medical intervention is necessary to ensure that they do so. Testicles that are not present in the scrotal sac suffer heat stress and may be at higher risk of infertility and developing cancer.[1][10]",Causes of cryptorchidism,Most cases of cryptorchidism have no obvious cause.,Risk factors for cryptorchidism,Risk factors for having a male infant with undescended testicles include:[2][6][11][^AB],"
Premature birth
Low birth weight
A family history of undescended testicles, particularly in a father or brother
Maternal exposure to chemicals, such as diethystilbestrol, pesticides, brominated flame retardants, phthalates, and dioxins, polyvinyl chloride, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), or bisphenol A (BPA)
Existing congenital malformations of the urinary system or abdominal wall, such as bladder exstrophy[12], prune-belly syndrome,[13] gastroschisis,[14] or hypospadias
Hereditary syndromes affecting the hypothalamus, connective tissues or nervous system
Consanguinity of parents
",Diagnostic procedures,"As cryptorchidism is largely asymptomatic, most cases are discovered by caregivers or physicians doing routine physical examinations. If the infant is warm and relaxed, but the testes are not present in the scrotum, they may have undescended testicles.[11] In some cases, especially if the infant is cold, surprised or upset, the cremasteric reflex[15] may cause the testicles to retract out of the scrotum into the body. If this happens, the examination will have to be repeated when the infant is warm and calm.","The majority, around 80 percent, of undescended testicles are palpable (can be felt) during physical examination, due to their location in the neck of the scrotum. If they are in the abdomen or inguinal canal, they may be non-palpable. In such cases, a laparoscopic examination may be necessary to locate them. A laparoscopic exam involves inserting a laparoscope, a thin and flexible device with a camera, into the inguinal canal or abdomen.","In some cases, if the cryptorchidism affects both testicles (bilateral) and the testes are non-palpable, the infant may need to be assessed for a possible disorder or sexual differentiation. In such rare cases, ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used to locate the undescended testicles, especially if they are in the abdomen.[4] In rare cases, only one testicle may be present. This is known as monorchidism. Complete absence of testicles, known as anorchia, is extremely uncommon.[1]","Ideally, undescended testes should be located and treatment begun before the infant reaches one year of age.[1] Early treatment gives the testicle the best chance of developing normally, maintaining fertility and minimizing the risk of testicular cancer.[4]",Treatment options,"Undescended testicles must be treated if they have not descended spontaneously by the time the child is six months of age. After that age, they are unlikely to descend on their own. The goal of treatment for undescended testicles is to move viable undescended testes to the correct position in the scrotum and to remove nonviable testicular tissue if it is present.","The usual course of treatment is almost always surgery, known as orchidopexy, although in some cases, hormonal treatment may be possible.",Orchidopexy,"In cases where the testicle is palpable, the testis can be repositioned using a procedure known as an orchidopexy. The testicle needs to be palpable for this surgery to be an option.","In an orchidopexy, which is usually performed between the ages of six months and 11 years of age, the undescended testicle is brought into the scrotum, along with the vas deferens,[16] testicular blood vessels and spermatic cord. It is then fixed in the scrotum with sutures.[4] This procedure can be done laparoscopically or by open surgery. It is usually done through an incision in the inguinal area,the groin.[1]","If the undescended testis is not palpable, exploratory surgery is performed to determine whether the testis is present at all and then, if it is, whether it is viable. This exploratory surgery can be open surgery or laparoscopic surgery.[^AA]","If the testis is present and viable, a laparoscopic orchidopexy can be performed. In this case, a laparoscope — a small, slender instrument equipped with a light and a camera — will be used to locate the testis and then guide the procedure to bring it into position. Open surgery is not usually performed in cases where the exact location of the testis is unknown.[1]If the testicle is high in the abdomen, complications may occur because the blood vessels and spermatic cord may not be long enough to allow movement into the scrotum.[17] If it is discovered that no testes are present, or that only one is present, any atrophied testicular tissue that is found will be removed.","Orchidopexies should be performed as early as possible to maximize fertility potential in later life and keep the risk of testicular cancer to a minimum. Also, they are easier to do if the child is still physically small, as the distances that the vessels and organs need to be moved are shorter.[4]",Surgery in the form of orchidopexy is considered the best and most effective treatment for undescended testicles. There is usually no likelihood of long-term problems following such a procedure.[11],Hormonal treatment,"Hormonal therapy for undescended testicles is controversial and not widely recommended. It is not generally believed to be very effective, only working in about a fifth of cases.[2]",Complications of cryptorchidism,"It is generally considered best to correct cryptorchidism when the affected infant is young. If left uncorrected, cryptorchidism can lead to a higher risk of testicular cancer and can affect fertility. There is also a risk of testicular torsion, testicular trauma and inguinal hernia.",Testicular cancer,"Testicular cancer is the most common cancer in men between the ages of 15 and 35 years.[18]. Globally, the incidence of testicular cancer appears to be rising, but it has good recovery rates.","Approximately 11 percent  of all cases of testicular cancer affect men with a history of undescended testicles. Orchidopexy performed as early as possible in life decreases the risk of testicular cancer developing in the affected testis or testes.[2] If undescended testes are discovered in the inguinal ring or in the abdomen only after puberty, they may have to be removed in order to minimize the risk of testicular cancer.","One of the major risks accompanying untreated undescended testicles is that testicular cancer may not be detected until it is quite advanced, due to the difficulty of self-examining a testicle if it is not palpable.[11] (See FAQs)",Infertility,"Men with a history of cryptorchidism may have lower sperm counts, sperm of poorer quality and lower fertility than men with normally-descended testes. The degree to which men are affected, depends on whether one or both testes were undescended and how long they were undescended before being corrected.","While men with unilateral corrected undescended testicles are generally less fertile than men with bilateral normally-descended testes, they have the same rate of paternity, which means that they are equally likely to father children. However, men with a history of bilateral corrected undescended testes have lower fertility and paternity rates than their counterparts with unilateral undescended or bilaterally descended testicles. Men with uncorrected unilateral or bilateral undescended testes are highest at risk of being infertile.","Treating the undescended testis at an early age is intended to avoid the risk of low fertility by ensuring that the testis is moved to its optimal environment as early as possible. Testes that remain inside the body are at risk of heat stress, which negatively affects the development of sperm and may cause low sperm count, low sperm quality or low semen quality.",Testicular torsion[19],"Testicular torsion can occur at any age and is about ten times more common among males with cryptorchidism than it is among those with normally-descended testes. It can occur alongside a testicular tumor, because the weight and size of the tumor can distort the testicle and twist it out of place. It is possible that the greater severity of testicular torsion among undescended testicles results from the fact that detection is often delayed due to the testicle’s location inside the body.","Symptoms of testicular torsion differ according to the location of the undescended testis, but can include:","
Swelling in the groin (inguinal area)
Empty scrotal sac on the same side as the swelling
Acute abdomen, a condition of severe abdominal pain.
",Acute abdomen is a medical emergency and medical help must be sought immediately.,Testicular trauma[19],"If the testis is in the inguinal canal, it is at risk of blunt trauma if the affected person receives a blow in that area. The testis may be compressed against the pubic bone and be injured.",Inguinal hernia[20][21][22],"During the development of the fetus in the womb, the lining of the abdominal cavity extends into the groin. In male fetuses, the testicles and spermatic cords descend through the abdominal lining via a hernia into the inguinal canal and then into the scrotum, after which the abdominal lining closes. In some cases, such as some cases of cryptorchidism, the abdominal lining and hernia do not close properly, and part of the small intestine may move into the inguinal canal. This usually presents with swelling and pain, and requires surgical treatment.",Cryptorchidism FAQs,"Q: Will I be able to have children if I have a corrected undescended testicle?
A: Yes. If you received treatment early in life, you will have a similar paternity rate as men who had normally-descended testicles.","Q: Does having an undescended testicle affect my testosterone levels?** 
A: Yes. It may lead to your testosterone levels being lower than the norm. When this is caused by undescended testicles, it is known as primary hypogonadism. However, if your undescended testis was corrected early in life, your testosterone levels may be normal.[23]","Low testosterone can also be caused by injury to the testicle, diabetes, medication, aging or even pituitary tumors.","Q: How do I check for testicular cancer?** 
A: The most common first symptom of testicular cancer is a painless lump on or inside a testicle. Men should routinely check their testicles for lumps, which can be done by rolling their testicles gently between their fingers and noting any changes. If a lump is found, or there is pain that is not the result of applying too much pressure, men should seek medical help."
,,,,,,,,,,What is Cushing’s syndrome?
,,,,,,,,,,What is Cushing’s syndrome?,"Cushing’s syndrome is a condition caused by an excess of a steroid hormone called cortisol. This can be caused by taking too much of a medicine which contains cortisol (steroids) or by the body producing too much cortisol. People with Cushing’s syndrome gain weight around their middle and in the face, and develop thin, stretched skin. This condition tends to affect adults between 20 and 50 years of age. The treatment of this condition depends on the cause. Once the underlying cause is recognized and removed, most people with Cushing’s syndrome will recover well. Untreated Cushing’s syndrome can cause osteoporosis, diabetes, high blood pressure and stroke.",Risks,"Cushing’s syndrome develops if there is too much cortisol in the body. The most common cause is taking a steroid medication for a long period of time. Cushing’s syndrome can also occur when the body produces too much cortisol. This happens when a growth or cancer causes too much cortisol to be produces. This condition most commonly affects adults between the ages of 20 and 50 years of age, and affects three times as many women as men.",Symptoms,"The typical symptoms include a red, full face (moon face), weight gain around the belly, a hump between the shoulders, skin changes (thinning, stretch marks, easy bruising, increased hair growth) and muscle weakness. Women may become hairier than they previously were. Children may not grow as fast as their peers. Cortisol may affect sexual function and some men may experience erection problems and decreased sexual desire.",Diagnosis,"Diagnosis is made by evaluating a person's medical history, with special attention to medications, and physical examination where the doctor checks for the typical signs of Cushing’s syndrome. If a medication isn't the cause of the symptoms, saliva, urine and blood tests are done to test cortisol hormone levels, and imaging tests (ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) may be done to look for a cause for the excess cortisol.",Treatment,"The treatment depends on the cause of the high cortisol level. If it is caused by a high intake of cortisol, the dosage of the medication should be reduced slowly. People taking steroid medications should never stop these medications suddenly. If a growth is the underlying reason, then it may have to be removed by surgery. If it is not safe to remove the cause of the high cortisol levels, cortisol can be blocked by other medications.",Prevention,Taking care to avoid long term use of cortisol-containing medications may help to prevent some cases of Cushing’s syndrome.,Other names for Cushing’s syndrome,"

,,,,,,,,,,What are cutaneous burns?
,,,,,,,,,,What are cutaneous burns?,"Cutaneous burns, also known as thermal injuries, are one of the most common household injuries, mostly caused by hot liquids or fire. They can be mild or life-threatening emergencies depending on the percentage of the surface of the body which is burned. Treatment depends on the severity of the injury and possible complications. It varies from minor wound care to treatment in a special burn unit, including medications, wound dressings or surgery. The recovery prognosis after small, superficial burns is usually good. The deeper the burn, the more likely it becomes that scarring will occur. Burns which cover large areas of the body are less likely to recover well.",Risks,"A cutaneous burn is damage to the skin caused by heat. Common causes are fire, hot liquids (especially in children), radiation, and ultraviolet light (like sunlight or tanning beds). The severity of burns is classified by how deep the burn is and how much of the body is affected. Cutaneous burns can affect anyone, but tend to affect children and older people more commonly than teenagers and adults. Cutaneous burns are most likely occur by accident, but may also be a sign of abuse.",Symptoms,"The symptoms and the appearance of a burn both depend on the degree of the burn, which is determined by the depth of the skin affected by the burn. There are three different degrees. First degree, or superficial, burns cause red, swollen and painful skin, which doesn't blister. Second degree burns cause blistering skin and the skin under the blister may be slightly numb. Third degree burns cause the skin to turn black or white, and are usually painless due to nerve damage.",Diagnosis,The diagnosis is made based on the symptoms and by examining the burned skin.,Treatment,"Treatment depends on the degree and the extent of the injuries. First of all, the person should be removed from the source of the heat. Small first or second degree burns may be cooled under running water for a few minutes. People who suffer larger, more serious burns should be treated by emergency services and specialist burn units.

",Read more about Signs of Depression »,Mixed episodes,People with cyclothymic disorder have a high tendency towards experiencing depression combined with the high energy of hypomania. This is known as a mixed state or mixed episode.[8][11],"Mixed episodes can be difficult to cope with, because the emotional experience is confusing. Someone in a mixed state also poses a greater risk of attempted suicide, as the person may feel the sadness and hopelessness of depression while in an energized state.[6]",Causes of cyclothymic disorder,"It is not known what causes cyclothymic disorder. However, people with the condition often have relatives with bipolar disorder, and there is thought to be a hereditary link.[5][13]",Risk factors for cyclothymic disorder,Cyclothymic disorder can develop into bipolar disorder. This is thought to occur in less than half of people with the condition.[5][13],"People with cyclothymic disorder are more likely to misuse substances such as alcohol and illegal drugs, e.g. cocaine. This is caused by reduced impulse control during high moods and heightened reactions to experiences that are perceived as pleasurable.[8][14]","The instability of cyclothymic disorder can increase the risk of suicide. This is because of moods shifting relatively rapidly between depression and feeling energized, as well as a tendency towards extreme emotional reactions.[8][15][16]","People experiencing symptoms of cyclothymic disorder should seek professional medical help. In addition, they can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.",Diagnosing cyclothymic disorder,"Diagnosis will be made by taking a medical history, possibly in discussion with a psychiatrist.

,,,,,,,,,,What is cystic fibrosis?
,,,,,,,,,,What is cystic fibrosis?,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic condition which primarily affects the lungs and pancreas, but which can also affect other parts of the body, including the liver, kidneys and intestines. The disease is caused by a defect in the CFTR gene which helps proteins produce and release the body’s secretions, causing these secretions to become thick and sticky.[1] Additional symptoms may include salty skin, digestion problems and poor growth in children.","Cystic fibrosis can be detected at birth through routine testing, with symptoms first appearing in early childhood and gradually worsening over time.[2] Treatment options are available to help manage the condition, but, in the majority of cases, life-expectancy is reduced.",Symptoms of cystic fibrosis,"The signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis generally begin to occur around 6-8 months after birth, though this can differ significantly from person to person.[1] Symptoms tend to differ depending on age and can affect various areas of the body.",Digestive symptoms of CF,"One of the main areas that the condition affects is the pancreas, a glandular organ located within the gastrointestinal tract, or gut. The pancreas usually produces enzyme-containing digestive secretions, which flow out of the pancreas and into the duodenum to help digest food. Cystic fibrosis can block the flow of these digestive secretions, affecting the way food is digested. This can lead to:[3]","
Large, fatty and foul-smelling stools
Bloating of the abdomen
Constipation
Malnutrition and poor growth
",Lung symptoms of CF,"Cystic fibrosis can also cause the lungs to create thicker than normal sputum, or phlegm. As a consequence, bacteria may become trapped in the airways, causing infection and inflammation. If this happens, symptoms may include:[3]","
A persistent cough, typically accompanied by sputum
Wheezing
Shortness of breath
Recurrent chest infections
","Newborns with cystic fibrosis may have long-lasting jaundice, as well as meconium ileus, a condition that causes the gut to become clogged with meconium. This is a dark, sticky substance produced shortly before birth, usually excreted as a newborn’s first stool. If the gut becomes clogged with meconium, this may require surgery to relieve.[3]","Some people with CF may also develop secondary conditions such as diabetes, osteoporosis, liver problems and male infertility.[2] The Ada app can help you check your symptoms. Download the free app or find out more about the how it works.",Causes of cystic fibrosis,"Cystic fibrosis is one of the most common inherited disorders.[1] It is caused by a defect in the CFTR gene on chromosome 7. The CFTR gene controls the way sodium and chloride (salt) ions move in and out of the body’s cells. In people with cystic fibrosis, the gene defect causes too much sodium to enter the cells, which, in turn, causes too much water to enter the cells, leaving too little outside. This leads to secretions from outside the cells to be too thick.[3]",The CFTR gene can be affected by over a thousand different defects. The type of defect can affect the level of severity of cystic fibrosis.[4],How is cystic fibrosis inherited?,"Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning that to inherit the disorder, a person must receive two faulty genes, one from each parent. People with just one cystic fibrosis gene are known as carriers and usually lead normal lives. They can, however, pass the cystic fibrosis gene onto their children.","Cystic fibrosis is far more common in people of white-European descent than in people from any other ethnic group. An estimated 30,000 people are currently living with the disorder in the United States, with approximately 1,000 new cases diagnosed each year.[5]",Diagnosing cystic fibrosis,"Cystic fibrosis is diagnosed following various tests. In the United States, 75 percent of people with the condition are diagnosed by the age of 2.[5]",Tests to diagnose cystic fibrosis include:[3][4],"
Newborn screening: All US states and many countries in the world test newborn babies for CF as a matter of routine. This may involve a genetic test to check for a gene defect, and/or a blood test to screen for pancreatic problems.
Sweat test: If CF is suspected after initial testing, a sweat test may be used to confirm the diagnosis. This test involves analysing a sweat sample to see how much salt it contains. An abnormally high level may indicate CF.
Other tests: If CF is confirmed, other tests may be carried out to check for complications. These may include ultrasound scans, X-rays and a biopsy.
",Cystic fibrosis treatment,"Treating cystic fibrosis typically involves the work of a varied team of CF specialists, nurses, dieticians, respiratory therapists, physical therapists and social workers, among others. This is necessary in order to help treat the many and varied symptoms of the condition. While there is currently no cure, cystic fibrosis can be managed effectively in most cases.","The range of possible treatment methods for cystic fibrosis is large and depends upon the symptoms being experienced. The following should be considered a general overview of some of the most commonly used treatment methods, not an exhaustive list.",Pancreatic treatment methods,"Most people with cystic fibrosis will experience difficulty properly digesting food. A dietician will outline a detailed nutrition plan, typically high in fats and carbohydrates, to help combat this. Enzyme supplements may also be necessary, normally with each meal.",Lung treatment methods,"Physical therapy, specifically focused on the chest, is often necessary to help clear the airways of sputum. A physical therapist will demonstrate how this is done, so parents and carers can carry out the procedure at home. Typically, the child lies face-down, and a specialist chest-patting technique is applied, encouraging the mucus to be coughed up. Children and adults with cystic fibrosis are also generally encouraged to take part in as much physical activity as possible, such as running or swimming.","Antibiotics are also a common aspect of cystic fibrosis treatment. Many people with the condition will take regular long-term courses of the medication, particularly when chest infections develop. If an infection is severe, antibiotic medications taken intravenously may be necessary.[3]","Other treatment options for lung-related problems include inhalers, the use of oxygen, which may be necessary overnight in some cases, as well as medications such as dornase alfa, ibuprofen and azithromycin.[3]","In severe cases, if the condition fails to respond to treatment, a lung transplant may be required. If successful, this can provide significant relief, but, as all major surgical procedures, it carries a variety of risks.[6]",Cystic fibrosis prevention,"As a genetic condition, there is no way to prevent cystic fibrosis. In many countries, babies are screened shortly after birth to ensure that treatment is begun as early as possible.","For people concerned about the possibility of being a cystic fibrosis carrier, genetic counseling and testing are available. Testing can help identify the presence of a faulty gene and counseling can help people to better understand the consequences of testing, as well as the typical pattern of progression of the condition and the treatment options available.[7]","To help prevent potentially harmful bacteria being passed on, people who already have cystic fibrosis should avoid spending time with other people with the condition, especially indoors. Bacteria, such as Burkholderia cepacia complex and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, pose little risk to people without CF, but can settle in the lungs and can cause harm to those who do. Activities such as meeting, sharing rooms and sharing objects should, therefore, be avoided.[8]",Cystic fibrosis prognosis,"Through improved treatment methods and better understanding over the past few decades, the typical life expectancy of a person with cystic fibrosis has drastically improved and roughly 80 percent of children diagnosed with the condition survive into adulthood.[1]","Cystic fibrosis, however, remains a serious, life-limiting condition. The prognosis typically differs from person to person, depending on the severity of the condition, the symptoms that are present, as well as the treatment options available. Today, many people with cystic fibrosis live into their late 30s and children diagnosed with the condition today are expected to live into their 40s or 50s. Mortality in childhood or early adulthood, however, is still possible.[1][3]",Cystic fibrosis FAQs,"Q: Is there a cure for cystic fibrosis?
A: No. Currently, there is no cure for cystic fibrosis. Although treatment methods and life-expectancy have greatly improved over the past few decades, the condition remains a lifelong condition.","Q: Is cystic fibrosis dominant or recessive?
A: Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder. This means that two copies of the faulty gene are required to pass on the condition, one from the mother and one from the father. If only one gene is inherited, that person becomes a carrier. They will typically live normal lives, but will be able to pass on the condition to others.","Q: Is cystic fibrosis contagious?
A: No, cystic fibrosis is not contagious. It is an inherited condition, meaning it can only be passed on genetically. However, if a person with cystic fibrosis develops a bacterial or viral lung infection, this is contagious to people with or without CF. To prevent passing on the infection, people with a contagious lung infection should take steps to limit their exposure to other people until the condition has resolved."

Almost everyone will be infected with the cytomegalovirus at some point in their life, usually as a child, though it is possible to contract the virus for the first time as an adult. The virus stays in the body after infection and may reactivate if the immune system becomes weak. People with medical conditions (eg. HIV/AIDS, leukemia) or who take medications which cause immune problems (eg. after an organ transplant) are at risk of a recurrence of the virus and severe symptoms. Pregnant women who have never had CMV are at risk of passing the virus to the unborn child.",Symptoms,"Typical symptoms include fever, feeling generally unwell, a loss of appetite, muscle aches, rash and a sore throat. It may also lead to headache, cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, hives, jaundice, vision problems and neck stiffness.",Diagnosis,"Diagnosis of CMV is usually made by taking a blood sample which tests for the presence of antibodies, proteins which fight infections, created by the immune system after exposure to CMV. Other tests can look for the presence of CMV itself in the blood or other bodily fluids.",Treatment,"People with normal immune systems generally do not require any treatment. Pain-relieving medications for muscle aches and gargling salt-water for a sore throat may be useful. People with weakened immune systems often need antiviral medications to fight the virus, reduce the severity of the symptoms and decrease the likelihood of complications.",Prevention,"There is no vaccine for cytomegalovirus. Infections may be prevented by maintaining good hygiene (eg. washing hands and avoiding social situations when sick) and avoiding close contact, kissing or sexual contact with infected people.

,,,,,,,,,,What is a dental abscess?
,,,,,,,,,,What is a dental abscess?,"An abscess is a pocket of pus that forms within body tissues.[1] Abscesses are the result of an infection, generally bacterial, localized in the area where the abscess forms. They are almost always accompanied by swelling and inflammation. Dental abscesses are abscesses affecting the teeth and adjacent jaw tissue.","Each tooth is made up of several layers. The outermost layer is the enamel, which covers a softer layer, the dentin. The dentin and enamel are the tooth’s protective layers. Underneath the dentin is the pulp, where the tooth’s nerves and blood vessels are situated. The pulp runs down the center of the root of the tooth, which connects the tooth to the underlying bone of the upper or lower jaw. Infections in the pulp can therefore easily spread into the bone of the jaw. Likewise, if the gum around the tooth becomes infected, the tooth is at risk of damage as well. Some abscesses affect the pulp first and spread to the bone, while others affect the surrounding tissues of the gum and do not start in the pulp.","In abscesses, the presence of plaque[2] and gingivitis[3] are likely to make the situation worse. Antibiotics are sometimes necessary to control the infection.[4] If treated correctly, dental abscesses are not life-threatening. Treatment of dental abscesses is usually carried out by dentists, and often involves taking an antibiotic and root canal treatment. In rare cases, however, the infection can spread, and the condition may become very severe and possibly life-threatening in extremely rare cases.[5]",Treatment for dental abscesses involves draining the pus from the tooth and filling or removing the tooth to prevent re-infection.,There are two major subtypes of dental abscess: periapical and periodontal.,"Good to know: A third type, pericoronitis, is much less common. In pericoronitis, the infection affects the gum flap, known as the operculum, which covers a tooth that has not yet erupted through the gum. This article deals with periapical and periodontal abscesses. For more information on pericoronitis, please see the FAQs.",Periapical abscesses: affecting the inside of the tooth,Periapical abscesses usually occur near the tip of the root of the tooth. They are more common among children than among adults. Children with poor dental hygiene are particularly at risk of periapical abscesses.[5],"Poor dental hygiene, including inadequate brushing or flossing, can cause caries, also known as cavities, which erode the enamel and dentin, admitting bacteria to the pulp. As a result of this, the pulp becomes inflamed, and this can lead to the death of nerves in the tooth. Because dead tissue is more vulnerable to infection, this puts the tooth at high risk of an abscess.[1]","In periapical abscesses, damage to the enamel and dentin, as in the case of later-stage cavities admits bacteria to the pulp, leading to an inflammatory condition known as pulpitis. Periapical abscesses are a common complication of severe, long-term pulpitis.[6] They can cause swelling in the jaw, cheeks and the floor of the mouth.[2]",Periodontal abscesses: affecting the gums,"Periodontal abscesses are more common among adults than children and are often a complication of gum disease.[1] They tend to originate in the alveolar bone[7] and periodontium.[8] Gum disease or injury can cause teeth to become loose and/or inflamed, including the surrounding area. The resulting pocket that forms between the tissue and the tooth is vulnerable to infection by bacteria which can then form a periodontal abscess.[1]",Signs and symptoms of a dental abscess,"Dental abscesses are usually painful. The pain may be situated in the tooth itself, the surrounding gum or be more generalized, including the jaw, cheeks, or even neck or face, depending on the location of the abscess.[1] The affected tooth may feel tender, loose in the jaw, sensitive to heat and/or cold in the mouth and pressure on the tooth, or to being tapped,[5] and/or may be slightly raised.[6] People with a dental abscess may experience pain in the affected area. If you are concerned that you may have a dental abscess, you can do a free symptom check with the Ada app or find out more about how it works.",Other symptoms of dental abscesses include:[1][5],"
Swelling in the gums or face
Redness of the skin over the affected part of the gum
Bleeding in the gums
Swollen lymph glands in the neck
Generally feeling unwell (malaise)
Loss of appetite or inability to eat
Fever
","Dental examination may also reveal swelling and redness around the tooth in the mouth and a fluctuant (movable/shiftable) mass in the area.[9] Periodontal abscesses may also present with a gum boil. A gum boil, also known as a parulis, is a soft red papule that appears where a sinus or channel from an abscess reaches the outside of the gum, between the gum and the inside of the cheek. It is the result of an abscess, so it is a definite sign that an abscess is present, but it is not itself an abscess.","Rarely, in severe cases of dental abscess, the affected person may also experience:[5]","
Cellulitis, a bacterial infection of skin and subcutaneous tissues
Lockjaw (trismus)
Difficulty swallowing, due to pain and swelling
Difficulty breathing, due to swelling
Difficulty speaking
Dehydration
","Generally, a spreading dental infection as a result of an abscess may cause the affected person to feel very unwell. They may have a fever (a body temperature of 38 C / 100.4 F or higher), swelling in the floor of the mouth, the face or the jaw and severe pain that does not respond to maximum doses of over-the-counter painkillers such as ibuprofen.","If any of these symptoms occur, the affected person should seek emergency dental care from a dentist or, if no dental care is available, visit a hospital emergency department or see another doctor as soon as possible. While doctors are not trained to handle dental procedures, they will be able to assist with antibiotics and painkillers to control the infection and pain until dental care is accessed.",Causes of dental abscesses,"Dental abscesses are the result of bacterial infection. When the gum tissue surrounding a tooth becomes damaged or the tooth itself is damaged, bacteria that are already in the mouth and, under usual circumstances not harmful, may enter the area and cause infection.","One of the most common causes of damage to the teeth and gums is poor dental hygiene, such as inadequate brushing and flossing, high sugar or carbohydrate consumption, and lack of regular checkups at the dentist. These factors may lead to dental caries or cavities, gingivitis and periodontitis, which can admit bacteria to the inside of the tooth or the gum.[10] Maintaining healthy teeth and gums is therefore one of the best ways of reducing the risk of developing dental abscesses, as it removes one of the main causes of abscesses.",Diagnosing dental abscesses,"If a dental abscess is suspected, the affected person should visit the dentist as soon as possible. The dentist will perform an examination of the affected area. They may test the affected tooth by pressing on it or tapping it with an instrument.[6] If the tooth is infected, it will usually be very sensitive to pressure or tapping (percussion), and may often be painful. Further, if the abscess is periapical, the swelling at the root will push the tooth upwards in its socket, and it will feel higher than the surrounding teeth.","While laboratory testing is not usually needed to establish whether or not an abscess is present, dentists will usually do an X-ray of the affected tooth and the mouth as a whole to establish the exact location and the size of the abscess.[5]",The abscess may be aspirated[11] and the pus cultured to determine which strains of bacteria are involved. This helps to guide antibiotic therapy if it is needed.[5],Treatment of dental abscesses,"The usual treatment for a dental abscess is to drain pus as soon as it is possible to do so. This will be done surgically, either by a dentist or a maxillofacial surgeon, a surgeon that has trained as a dentist as well as a doctor and handles complex jaw, tooth and mouth conditions.[5] They may make an incision in the gum or drill a hole in the tooth to allow the pus to drain.[1]","Once the pus has drained away, the area will be cleaned. In periapical abscesses, all dead pulpal tissue will be removed to prevent infection recurring.[1] In periodontal abscesses, a very deep cleaning of the teeth and specifically the gum and roots will be done. A root canal may also be necessary if the whole tooth is compromised. If the decay is severe, the tooth may be removed.",Root canal treatment,"Root canal treatment is the standard treatment for the removal of pulpal tissue in cases where the tooth will be retained and not extracted, and it may also be an option in cases where pain is ongoing even after the abscess is resolved.[12]  The person undergoing a root canal will be given a local anesthetic injection to numb the parts of the jaw and mouth affected by the abscess. During the procedure, the dead or infected pulp is removed, the inside of the pulp canals are smoothed, and the pulp is replaced with a filling, often gutta percha.[13] In a few months time, an X-ray and dental checkup will be done to check that the site is healing properly.",Pain management and antibiotics,"As abscesses are painful, people may need acetaminophen or ibuprofen to control the pain. Essential oil of cloves has topical anesthetic properties and can be applied to the painful area, although it is very important to maintain strict hygiene while doing this. Home remedies like the above mentioned oil may provide some pain relief, but will not cure an abscess or prevent further infection.","In uncomplicated abscesses, antibiotics may not be necessary.","If the infection is severe or has spread, or if the abscess cannot be drained, antibiotics will be prescribed to help bring the infection under control. Antibiotics commonly prescribed for dental abscesses include:[5]","
Penicillin
Amoxicillin, alone or in combination with clavulanate
Azithromycin
Metronidazole
Cefoxitin
","If the patient is allergic to amoxicillin and/or penicillin, clindamycin may be prescribed. Penicillin is the usual antibiotic used to treat mild or moderate infections. Because antibiotics alone don’t always penetrate the abscess very well, the abscess may also be surgically drained.[5]",Most dental abscesses are straightforward to treat and resolve completely after they are drained.,Home treatment of dental abscesses,"Although essential oil of cloves can be used to manage the pain and sensitivity associated with dental abscesses, it will not cure the abscess. Abscesses will not go away on their own and cannot be treated at home. Untreated abscesses can develop secondary infections and other serious complications that are extremely hazardous to health (see below). It is possible for an untreated abscess to become a medical emergency requiring urgent care from a doctor or dentist. It may also lead to jaw bone loss.","Only a qualified medical or dental professional is properly equipped to administer treatment for an abscess safely and effectively.[14] It is strongly advised that people affected by abscesses, or who suspect they may have a dental abscess, seek out the advice of a dentist as soon as they can. It is not safe to try to drain an abscess at home or to leave an abscess untreated.",When to seek emergency treatment for dental abscesses,"Ideally, a person affected by a dental abscess, or who suspects that they may have a dental abscess, should visit the dentist as soon as possible. Because it is not always possible to see a dentist in time, some people may need to be treated for their abscesses in a hospital emergency department. Medical doctors are not specifically trained to handle dental issues, but will be able to stabilize the affected person, providing antibiotics and pain relief, until they can see the dentist.",Good to know: Dentists do not form part of the regular staff in most hospital emergency departments. Treatment by a doctor at a hospital will not replace seeing a dentist. Doctors are not trained to deal with dental problems but will be able to assist with managing infection and pain.,"If a person with an abscess or a suspected abscess shows any of the signs listed below, they should seek urgent medical care as soon as possible.[15][16][17] Danger signs for tooth abscesses include:","
An abscess of more than 1cm in diameter, or which feels large
Severe swelling or hard lumps on the gums or the face
Bleeding on the gums or in the mouth
Fever or a body temperature of more than 38 C / 101.4 F
Tender lymph nodes in the neck area
","If a person shows the symptoms listed below, they should immediately be seen by a hospital emergency department:[18][19][20]","
Severe pain that cannot be controlled with painkillers
Shortness of breath or other difficulty breathing
Difficulty swallowing due to swelling, or difficulty taking in liquids leading to dehydration
Severe difficulty opening the mouth
Swelling of the neck or around the eyes, or severe swelling of the face in general
Secretions in the mouth they can’t handle due to difficulty swallowing, opening the mouth or others
",Complications of dental abscess,"In rare cases, complications do arise. These can include:[1][5][21][22]","
Cellulitis, an infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissues.
Ludwig’s angina, which occurs when cellulitis spreads into the tissues under the tongue, in the lower jaw and under the chin. It is also known as submandibular cellulitis/submandibular space infection.
Osteomyelitis, an infection of underlying bone.
Parapharyngeal abscess, an abscess at the back of the mouth, near the throat. It is caused by staphylococcal and/or streptococcal bacteria. It is most common in children aged five years or younger.
Cavernous sinus thrombosis, which can occur when the infection spreads into the blood vessels in the sinuses of the head.
Sepsis
",These conditions require very urgent medical attention and are best evaluated via a hospital emergency department.[18][19][20],Cellulitis and facial cellulitis,"Cellulitis is an infection of the skin. Facial cellulitis,  for example, can be caused by infections of the upper respiratory tract, middle ear infections or tooth abscesses. Although these conditions can increase the risk of facial cellulitis, they do not directly cause it; the condition results when an infection spreads to the skin. Symptoms of facial cellulitis include:[23]","
Swollen, red skin on the face, especially the cheek
Itching and burning of the affected skin
A painful, possibly swollen, tongue
Fever
","If you are concerned that you or a loved one may have cellulitis or a tooth abscess, you can start a free symptom assessment right now using the Ada app.",Parapharyngeal abscesses and Ludwig’s angina,"Parapharyngeal abscesses and Ludwig’s angina can both cause swelling severe enough to obstruct the airways and cause difficulty breathing. Parapharyngeal abscesses require a CT scan and needle aspiration to diagnose. Ludwig’s angina is diagnosed by CT scan, needle aspiration and X-rays.","Treatment for Ludwig’s angina, parapharyngeal abscess, osteomyelitis, cellulitis and cavernous sinus thrombosis involves drainage of any pus that is present, possibly via surgery and antibiotics and possibly intravenous antibiotics. People affected by Ludwig’s angina, if untreated, may require a tracheostomy to open their airways and thereby help them breathe if the swelling obstructs the windpipe.[14]",Spreading infection,"A spreading untreated infection from a dental abscess can cause pain around the eyes, ear pain, nose pain and swelling in the eyes or face. Severe dental infections can spread to other parts of the body, causing potentially serious medical conditions such as bacterial meningitis and infective endocarditis.","An untreated dental abscess or one that does not respond to treatment can very rarely cause sepsis, which is potentially life-threatening.",Read more about Sepsis >>,Dental abscess FAQs,"Q: Can a dental abscess be dangerous?
A: While dental abscesses, especially if they are properly treated, typically do not cause severe or long-term problems, iIf left untreated or if improperly treated, a severe dental abscess can be potentially causing complications, possibly even serious ones.","Q: Are dental abscesses contagious?
A: No, they are not. Dental abscesses cannot be spread from one person to another.","**Q: How can dental abscesses be prevented? **
A: As dental abscesses are most often the result of dental caries or gum disease admitting bacteria to the vulnerable pulp of the tooth or into a gum pocket, the first line of prevention is preventing caries and gum disease. This involves maintaining good dental hygiene, including:","
Regular, twice daily brushing
Regular, daily flossing and use of mouthwash
Eating a healthy diet with limited sugar, particularly limiting or avoiding sugary drinks
Avoiding smoking
","Q: Are there any factors which predispose people to dental abscesses?
A: Some medications, such as anticholinergics, protease inhibitors, SSRI antidepressants and SNRI antidepressants can cause xerostomia, meaning dry mouth.[24][25] Dry mouth results from a decrease in the amount of saliva, which causes the amount of bacteria in the mouth to increase and can therefore worsen tooth decay. This can be prevented by taking especially good care of proper dental hygiene, drinking plenty of water and possibly talking to a doctor for further treatment options for the xerostomia itself.[24]",People who are immunocompromised may be at higher risk of dental abscesses because their immune systems cannot always adequately handle bacterial invasions. People at risk include:[1],"
People who are HIV positive or have AIDS
People who are undergoing chemotherapy
People who have sickle cell anemia
People who use steroids
People who have had a splenectomy
People taking immunosuppressive medication after transplantation
People with severe autoimmune diseases, taking immunosuppressive medication
","It is recommended that most people have a dental checkup at least once a year. Children and people who are at risk, or who have a history of dental problems, should go more often, at least twice per year. If a dental abscess is suspected, dental help should be sought immediately.","Q: What foods are safe to eat and drink after treatment for a dental abscess?
A: Many people find it best to eat soft, bland foods after treatment for a dental abscess, as there may be some mouth pain.[26] Foods such as milkshakes, bananas, applesauce, yogurt, cooked cereals, scrambled eggs, mashed potato and custard or soft pudding may be suitable.[27] It is important to ensure that the affected person stays well hydrated.","Q: What is pericoronitis?
A: Pericoronitis is a condition involving infection in the gum that covers an unerupted tooth, the operculum. It is particularly associated with wisdom teeth, especially impacted wisdom teeth. Sometimes the gum above the unerupted tooth breaks, and bacteria lodge in the damaged tissue, causing infection.[28]","Acute cases of pericoronitis can have symptoms such as pain in the jaw and pain when the affected person opens their mouth, as well as swelling and fever. Bad breath may also be a symptom.[29] Abscesses can also occur. Chronic pericoronitis may present with mild inflammation that comes and goes.[30] Pericoronitis will require the treatment and care of a dentist.","Pericoronitis can be treated with warm salt-water rinses and antibiotics such as metronidazole,  phenoxymethylpenicillin, or erythromycin[31].","Q: Can dental abscesses affect wisdom teeth?
A: Wisdom teeth, also known as third molars, usually erupt into the mouth in late adolescence. Occasionally, due to the position of the other teeth in the mouth, there is not enough space for them and as a result impaction may occur. Impaction can occur at any age and means that the teeth cannot erupt properly and get stuck completely or partly below the surface of the gum. Although this does not always cause problems,[32] it can cause pericoronitis, an inflammation (see above), which may then develop into an abscess.[33]","Q: Can a dental abscess cause swelling but no pain?
A: Yes. However, this is a cause for concern: if an abscessed tooth that has been painful initially stops being painful, it generally means that the affected tooth has died. Pain may also lessen considerably if the abscess ruptures and drains. It does not mean that the abscess is gone, however.[34] Infection can still spread and become very serious even if the tooth is not painful, and the affected person should see a dentist as soon as they can.","Q: Are all dental abscesses visible?
A: No. Those dental abscesses that develop a fistula or a gum-boil (see above) are visible, but it is possible for there to be no visible sign that an abscess has formed. If someone is experiencing mouth pain and/or any of the symptoms listed above, they should see a dentist to determine what is causing the pain, even if they cannot see anything obviously wrong in the mouth.","Q: Can a dental abscess be hard?
A: While most abscesses are usually soft and warm to the touch, occasionally they can feel firm or even hard to the touch.[35] Anyone with a suspected abscess, jaw swelling, jaw pain or tooth pain who feels a hard lump in the mouth should see a dentist as soon as possible.","Q: Can dental abscesses develop next to or underneath a crown, dentures, dental implant or a dental bridge?
A: Yes. Dental work such as crowns or implants can cause dental abscesses, but only if they are improperly done, damaged or broken. Crowns are often used to help preserve a tooth after a root canal has been done, meaning that they are attached to a tooth that is already compromised.[36] Although it is rare for abscesses to affect crowns, it is possible. Dentures can cause injury to the gums beneath them if they do not fit properly;[37] an injured gum is vulnerable to infection. It is important to make sure that dentures fit properly, and it is necessary to replace any denture that does not fit properly to reduce the risk of infection, injury and poor dental hygiene. Dental implants are used to replace missing teeth and are not natural teeth.[37] They are a little more susceptible to mechanical stress and therefore to colonization by bacteria that may lead to abscesses. However, most dental implants are successful.[38] Dental bridges do not have roots and cannot themselves become abscessed, but it is possible for one of the supporting teeth on either side of the bridged tooth to become abscessed.","Q: Can trauma or an injury to the mouth cause a dental abscess?
A: Yes. A trauma like a blow to a tooth, or, over the longer term, increased wear and tear, such as might result from chronically grinding or clenching teeth, can damage structures of the tooth and therefore increase the risk of a dental abscess developing by bacteria having easier access to this tooth’s sensitive areas.[39]","Q: Can dental abscesses appear under the tongue?
A: An abscess under the tongue is not a dental abscess, but it could possibly be the result of a dental abscess that has led to Ludwig’s angina, a form of cellulitis that affects the tissue below the tongue, below the lower jaw, and the floor of the mouth. Ludwig’s angina is a medical emergency, and the affected person should seek medical help in a hospital without delay."

,,,,,,,,,,What is depression in childhood or adolescence?,"Childhood and adolescent depression is an emotional disorder which affects people under the age of 18. Like depression in adults, it is characterized by persistent feelings of low self-esteem, sadness, and hopelessness and can last for weeks or months. It is more common in the teenage years. Signs of depression in children and adolescents include irritability, loss of interest and social isolation. These signs may be accompanied by physical symptoms such as sleeping difficulties, digestive problems, changes in appetite, and fatigue. Successful treatment typically involves psychological counseling and medication. With treatment and support, many people recover from depression. Untreated depression in children and teenagers may have lifelong consequences.",Risks,"Depression can affect children and young people of any age, including infants. This condition becomes more common with age and by adolescence, and many as 1 in 5 young people may have symptoms of depression. In childhood, boys are more commonly affected than girls, but during puberty, more girls are often affected than boys. The causes of depression are not clear, but it is probable that several factors combine to cause depression. These include stressful life events, a lack of social support, changes in brain chemicals and unstable family or social circumstances. Children who have a close family member with depression are more likely to also develop depression. Some children with ongoing medical issues are more likely develop depression. Infants born to women who experienced depression during pregnancy are more likely to show signs of depression.",Symptoms,"Symptoms of depression vary with age. Small children may express depression by uncontrollable crying or reluctance to eat or play. They may develop slower than other children and seem less interactive than other children. School-aged children appear impulsive, easily frustrated and sometimes have social and learning difficulties. They may develop self-harming behavior. Symptoms in teenagers can sometimes be difficult to recognize, but include a persistently low mood, and a lack of energy and motivation. They may experience or describe feelings of inner emptiness, insecurity, and trouble concentrating. Teenagers also experience physical symptoms, such as difficulty sleeping, stomach pain, a loss of appetite, weight loss or gain and headaches. Their school performance may gradually get worse. Less commonly, some teenagers may develop thoughts of death or suicide.",Diagnosis,"The diagnosis is usually made by an experienced child psychologist or psychiatrist based on the symptoms described by the young person. The doctor should rule out other possible causes for the symptoms. Some blood tests can be helpful to rule out these other causes. Keeping a diary which documents the patient’s mood, sleep, energy and thoughts might be helpful in making the diagnosis.",Treatment,"The treatment of depression in children and teenagers is guided by the severity of the symptoms and the circumstances of the child and their family. Treatment commonly involves psychotherapy (counseling) and sometimes medication. Counseling often involves the family, and is typically focussed on helping a young person learn to recognize and control their thoughts and feelings, and on teaching them healthy coping skills. Treatment is slow and steady, and it may take weeks to months until improvement is seen.",Prevention,"A reliable source of emotional support may help to prevent young people developing depression.

,,,,,,,,,,What is a depressive episode?,"The definition of a depressive episode is a period of depression that persists for at least two weeks.[1] During a depressive episode, a person will typically experience low or depressed mood and/or loss of interest in most activities, as well as a number of other symptoms of depression, such as tiredness, changes in appetite, feelings of worthlessness and recurrent thoughts of death. The length of a depressive episode varies, but the average duration is thought to be six to eight months.[2]","Depression is a common illness, and many people will experience one or more episodes of depression in their lifetime. While people of all races and ages can experience depressive episodes, they tend to be more common among women than men.[3][4] People who have a history of depression, other mental health conditions such as bipolar disorder or anxiety, or chronic physical conditions such as diabetes, chronic pain or multiple sclerosis[5], also have a higher risk of experiencing a depressive episode.[2]","The severity of a depressive episode varies; it may be classified as major or minor, depending on the number of symptoms and degree of impairment (social, domestic and work) experienced.[6] Regardless of the severity, all depressive episodes should be taken seriously and treated promptly by a professional healthcare provider.[7] Effective treatment, which typically involves medication and/or therapy, for depression is available.[4]","Without appropriate treatment, the risk of experiencing further episodes of depression is thought to be higher. The risk of another depressive episode occurring seems to increase with every new episode, with each one likely to last longer and be more severe than the previous one.

The main categories include:[15][16],"
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs): Typically the first line of treatment,[2] SSRIs tend to cause fewer side-effects than other antidepressants. Examples of SSRIs include fluoxetine, paroxetine and sertraline.
Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs): Similar to SSRIs, but may work better for some people. Examples include venlafaxine and duloxetine.
Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs): An older type of medication that may cause more side-effects. Generally only prescribed if other treatments do not work, or for other mental health conditions. Examples of TCAs include amitriptyline and imipramine.
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): A type of antidepressant usually prescribed when other treatments have not worked or have caused intolerable side-effects, as well as in cases of atypical depression, which has different characteristics to other types of depression. Examples include phenelzine and isocarboxazid. Because MAOIs can interact with certain foods and medications, special care must be taken with this antidepressant.[17]
","There are also a few other types of antidepressants, such as bupropion and mirtazapine.","It may take a few weeks for an antidepressant to take effect and alleviate the symptoms of a depressive episode. A doctor will advise on how long the medication should be taken and what to do if a person wishes to stop taking it. While antidepressants are not considered to be addictive, stopping them suddenly may cause discontinuation symptoms, so the process needs to be managed by a medical practitioner.[15]","Some people may experience side-effects while taking antidepressants, including:[15]","
Nausea and vomiting
Weight gain
Diarrhea or constipation
Feeling sleepy
Sexual problems
","While less common, other side-effects may include serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition where high levels of serotonin cause mental and physical symptoms like anxiety, rapid heartbeat, high temperature and vomiting,[18] and suicidal thoughts.[15]","It may be necessary for a person to try several different medications before finding one that they feel works for them.[15] The type of antidepressants prescribed will depend on the affected person’s age, health and medical history.

,,,,,,,,,,What is developmental dysplasia of the hip?
,,,,,,,,,,What is developmental dysplasia of the hip?,"Developmental dysplasia of the hip, or simply hip dysplasia, is a failure for the normal hip joint to form before birth. It may be caused by poor positioning of the legs in the womb. This doesn't cause any pain to young children, but can cause a limp and osteoarthritis as the child grows. Hip dysplasia can be successfully treated, especially if diagnosed and treated in babies or young children.",Risks,"In a normal hip, the upper end of the thigh bone (femur) is surrounded by the hip socket (acetabulum). In a dysplastic hip, there is an abnormality in the formation of either the head of the femur, the acetabulum, or the other supportive soft tissues. As a result, the contact between the femur and the acetabulum is loose and unstable, causing frequent hip dislocations. Hip dysplasia is more common in girls and people with who have family members with the condition. Within certain ethnic groups this condition tends to be more common, such as Native Americans and Laplanders. Other risk factors include being the first-born child or a breech baby.",Symptoms,"Babies will usually have no symptoms of hip dysplasia, though it might be possible to see a difference in the length or appearance of their legs, hips and buttocks. Toddlers with hip dysplasia may walk later than other children, and children with hip dysplasia who have not been diagnosed may suffer hip pain and walk with a waddle, limp or bowed legs.",Diagnosis,"All babies should be tested for hip dysplasia in the first weeks of their life. This is usually done by a doctor assessing the movement of the hips, or, increasingly, by ultrasound. X-rays of the hip joint can help to determine hip dysplasia in cases where there is uncertainty.",Treatment,"Hip dysplasia is treated by placing the baby in a harness or brace for a period of a few months to keep the legs in the correct position to allow the hips to form normally. If this is not successful or the developmental dysplasia of the hip is diagnosed later in life, surgery is necessary to reconstruct the hip joint.",Other names for developmental dysplasia of the hip,"

,,,,,,,,,,What is diabetes?
,,,,,,,,,,What is diabetes?,"Diabetes mellitus, commonly referred to as diabetes, is a condition in which the body’s blood glucose, or blood sugar, is too high. Glucose comes from the food we eat and is the body’s main source of energy. It is helped to reach the cells of the body by insulin, a hormone produced in the pancreas. Diabetes occurs when the body produces no or insufficient quantities of insulin to do this, and so glucose builds up in the blood.[1]","Persistently high blood glucose levels can, over time, cause health problems such as heart disease, stroke, kidney failure and vision loss.[2] With proper treatment, however, diabetes can generally be managed effectively and complications minimised. Treatment will usually be required throughout a person’s life as, currently, there exists no cure for diabetes.",Types of diabetes,"There are a number of types of diabetes, though type 1 and type 2 are the most common. Of these, type 2 is by far the most common, accounting for approximately 90 percent of all cases of diabetes in Europe and North America.[3]",Type 1 diabetes,"Type 1 diabetes typically develops in children and young people, though it can affect people of any age. It occurs when the body ceases to produce insulin and blood glucose levels become very high. This results from the body’s immune system mistakenly attacking the healthy cells in the pancreas responsible for producing insulin.[4]","The underlying cause of type 1 diabetes is not fully understood. Although not classed as a hereditary disorder, a person is more likely to develop type 1 diabetes if a close relative, such as a parent or a sibling, has the condition.","The symptoms of type 1 diabetes typically come on quickly, over a number of days or weeks, and include thirstiness, tiredness and a need to urinate frequently. Treatment generally involves the use of insulin injections.[5] With proper management, type 1 diabetes can usually be controlled effectively.",Type 2 diabetes,"Type 2 diabetes typically affects people over the age of 40, though it is becoming increasingly common in those of a younger age. This type of diabetes occurs when the body ceases to produce sufficient amounts of insulin, or when the body does not use insulin properly (something known as insulin resistance). It may also be caused by a combination of the two.[6]","Type 2 diabetes is often linked to being overweight or obese. The disorder also tends to run in families and is more common in people of Caribbean, African or South Asian descent. Symptoms typically develop slowly, over a number of months or years, and include thirstiness, tiredness and a need to urinate frequently. Treatment typically involves lifestyle changes such as eating a healthy diet and regular exercise, however in some cases medication may also be required to manage blood sugar levels.[6]",Read more about Type 2 Diabetes »,Other types of diabetes,"Type 1 and type 2 diabetes are by far the most common forms of the disorder. However, other types do also exist and include the following:","Gestational diabetes is diabetes that occurs for the first time during pregnancy. People with gestational diabetes have an increased risk of miscarriage, premature delivery, and the need for a cesarean section, though with proper management these risks can be significantly reduced.[7]","Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a rare, hereditary form of diabetes caused by a mutation of a single gene. In many cases, the signs and symptoms of MODY are mild and the condition may go unnoticed, only to be identified through routine testing or testing for another condition.[8]","Neonatal diabetes is a very rare form of diabetes, typically diagnosed in children under six months of age. The condition is caused by a gene mutation.[9]","Type 3 diabetes is a proposed alternative name for Alzheimer’s disease, as, in some cases, Alzheimer’s can be linked to insulin resistance.[10]","While technically not a form of diabetes, pre-diabetes, or impaired glucose intolerance, should also be noted. This condition occurs when blood glucose levels are high, but not high enough to qualify as diabetes, despite giving a similar risk of heart disease, stroke and other complications normally associated with diabetes. Pre-diabetes is typically managed through lifestyle changes such as losing weight or switching to a healthier diet.[11]",Symptoms of diabetes,The symptoms of type 1 and type 2 diabetes typically include:[12],"
Excessive thirst
A need to urinate frequently
Excessive hunger
Fatigue or tiredness
Blurred vision
Wounds that are slow to heal
Unexplained weight loss
Tingling and/or pain in the extremities
","The symptoms of type 1 diabetes typically develop quickly, over a number of days or weeks, while the symptoms of type 2 diabetes typically develop more gradually, normally over months or years. The symptoms of type 2 diabetes may be hard to detect at first and may sometimes be confused with normal signs of aging.",Read more about the Signs of Diabetes »,Causes of diabetes,"Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are caused by an insufficiency of insulin. However, what causes this insufficiency differs in each case.","Type 1 diabetes is, in most cases, an autoimmune disorder. This means that the immune system, which usually attacks unwanted germs and bacteria, mistakenly attacks healthy cells. In the case of type 1 diabetes, the immune system attacks insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. What triggers the immune system to do this is not known, though a popular theory suggests that it may be triggered by a virus.","There is also a genetic element to type 1 diabetes. Although it is not a hereditary disorder, if a first-degree relative – a parent or sibling, for example – has the condition, a person stands a greater chance of developing it themselves. In rare cases, type 1 diabetes can also be caused by severe inflammation of the pancreas or the surgical removal of the pancreas.[4][13]","Type 2 diabetes is generally caused by a combination of lifestyle and genetic factors. Lifestyle factors include being overweight or obese; eating a diet high in carbohydrates, sugars and fats; and physical inactivity. The likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes also increases significantly if a first-degree relative has experienced the condition.[3]",Diabetes complications,"With appropriate treatment, many people with diabetes are able to prevent possible complications of the condition occurring.","However, if treatment is not received, or if it is ineffective, a variety of complications can occur. These complications can be serious and possibly life-threatening.",Complications of diabetes include:[14],"Cardiovascular disease: Diabetes increases the risk of various cardiovascular problems including stroke, heart attack and atherosclerosis (narrowing of the arteries).","Nerve damage: Nerve damage can cause pain, tingling and numbness, especially in the extremities. Left untreated, this can lead to a total loss of feeling in the affected limbs.","Kidney damage: Damage to the kidneys can, in extreme cases, cause kidney failure and may lead to the need for dialysis or a kidney transplant. Read about the Signs of Kindey Problems »","Eye damage: Diabetes can, in extreme cases, lead to blindness and other vision problems such as cataracts and glaucoma.","Foot damage: Poor blood flow to the extremities and nerve damage can cause various complications. Wounds, for example, can be slow to heal, and this may be particularly problematic when the feet are affected. Serious infections may result, and, in severe cases, amputation may be required.","Hypoglycemia: Insulin taken to treat diabetes can, in some cases, cause blood sugar levels to fall too low. This is called hypoglycaemia, and initial symptoms may include feeling shaky, dizzy, tired or irritable. Mild hypoglycemia can typically be treated by oneself, whereas severe cases may require medical attention.","People who suspect that they may be experiencing a complication of diabetes should speak to a doctor. In addition, the free Ada app can be used to carry out a symptom assessment.",Diagnosing diabetes,Diagnosing diabetes will typically involve an evaluation of the symptoms being experienced and a variety of diagnostic tests. These tests may include:[15][16],"
Random blood glucose test: A reading of 200mg/dL or above will generally indicate diabetes.
Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test: A reading of 126mg/dL or above will generally indicate diabetes.
HbA1c test: A reading of 6.5 or above will generally indicate diabetes.
Oral glucose tolerance test: A reading of 200mg/dL or above will generally indicate diabetes.
","Tests to distinguish between type 1 and type 2 diabetes, such as a urine ketone test or glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) autoantibodies tests, may also be necessary.","Whichever test is used, it will usually be repeated several times to allow doctors to gain an accurate picture of a person’s blood glucose levels.","People displaying symptoms of diabetes should be tested. Moreover, people over the age of 40 should also consider testing, even if they are displaying no symptoms. This is especially true for people within the at-risk groups for type 2 diabetes – people who are overweight or of African, Caribbean or South Asian descent, for example.[15]",Diabetes treatment,"There is no cure for diabetes, meaning treatment is aimed at managing blood glucose levels and controlling the symptoms and possible complications of the condition. In the majority of cases, diabetes can be successfully managed.","People with type 1 diabetes will usually require regular insulin treatment in order to keep their insulin levels normal. This will typically involve insulin injections, which will be required around two to four times a day. Although some people may use a syringe, in most cases, what is known as an insulin pen or auto-injector will be used. A full explanation of how to administer the insulin will be given upon diagnosis with the condition. Family members or friends may also be taught how to properly do this.[17]","The blood glucose levels of people with type 1 diabetes will also need to be regularly checked. This can be done with a home monitoring kit, and can help to determine daily insulin needs. The levels will also be reviewed by doctors to ensure that the overall treatment plan is working effectively.[17]",Lifestyle changes are the main method of treatment for type 2 diabetes. This will typically involve:[4][18],"Dietary changes: Eating a healthy, balanced diet is key to controlling type 2 diabetes. A dietician will be able to provide guidelines on what to eat, though generally a diet low in fat and high in fibre, fruits and vegetables is recommended.",Exercising: Thirty minutes of moderate-intensity exercise five times per week is generally advised for people with type 2 diabetes.,"Losing weight: If a person with type 2 diabetes is overweight or obese, losing weight can be helpful in reducing blood glucose levels. Dietary changes and exercise can help with this.","In many cases, lifestyle changes alone are enough to reduce blood glucose to the target level, leading to remission. However, some people may also require medication. Medications that may be prescribed include metformin, sulfonylurea medicines, nateglinide and repaglinide.[4]",Diabetes prevention,Only type 2 diabetes is preventable. This is because this type of diabetes is commonly caused or exacerbated by unhealthy lifestyle choices.,"Adopting a healthy, balanced diet is the most important factor in helping to prevent type 2 diabetes.

,,,,,,,,,,What is diabetes insipidus?
,,,,,,,,,,What is diabetes insipidus?,"Diabetes insipidus is a hormonal condition that interferes with the water balance in the body. This condition occurs when the hormone anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) does not act strongly enough on the kidneys, causing them to pass more water than what is necessary. This condition causes people to feel more thirsty than usual and to produce large volumes of diluted urine. This condition can affect people of all ages. The outlook is usually good, although it can cause dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.",Risks,"Diabetes insipidus is a condition that interferes with the water balance in the body. A hormone called ADH (anti-diuretic hormone) is responsible for helping the kidneys to maintain water levels. If there is not enough ADH or in the kidneys don't respond to ADH in the blood, more water will be lost as urine. Damage to the pituitary gland or hypothalamus (the parts of the brain responsible for making ADH) or the kidneys can cause this condition. Some medications can make the kidneys less responsive to ADH. Pregnancy can also cause this condition, though this is not very common. Some people develop this condition without any obvious cause. Diabetes insipidus can affect people of all ages.",Symptoms,"Typical symptoms include feeling thirstier than usual, drinking large amounts of water and producing large volumes of urine. Some people produce up to 20 liters of urine a day. Other symptoms include waking up in the middle of the night to urinate (nocturia). People with this condition may become dehydrated if they can't drink enough fluids to replace the water lost in urine. Children may have a fever, loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhea or weight loss.",Diagnosis,"The diagnosis is usually made based on the symptoms and blood and urine tests. Some specialized tests may be done, such as a water deprivation test, where the amount of urine produced is measured and compared with the amount of water drunk during a given period. MRI scans (magnetic resonance imaging scans) of the brain may be done to investigate the pituitary gland.",Treatment,"The treatment depends on the cause of the diabetes insipidus. In some cases, it may be only necessary to increase the intake of water to avoid dehydration. Replacing ADH is often necessary.

,,,,,,,,,,What is diabetes mellitus (type 2)?
,,,,,,,,,,What is diabetes mellitus (type 2)?,"Diabetes mellitus (type 2) is a condition in which the body’s cells do not respond well to the hormone insulin. Insulin is produced by the pancreas to make sugar in the blood accessible to the body for energy. People with type 2 diabetes have a problem bringing sugar into cells, which causes the sugar to stay in the blood, causing high blood sugar levels. Symptoms of type 2 diabetes include a frequent need to urinate, producing large volumes of urine, feeling tired, weight loss and feeling more often thirsty than normal. Type 2 diabetes is managed with a good diet, regular exercise and medication to reduce the blood sugar levels.",Risks,"The pancreas is an organ that is placed behind the stomach and is connected to the bowel. It produces substances necessary for digestion and makes hormones (insulin and glucagon) which regulate the body's sugar (glucose) levels. Insulin is important, because it makes sugar in the blood available for use by the body as energy. Type 2 diabetes occurs when the cells of the body no longer respond to insulin, and as a result, do not take up sugar. Type 2 diabetes is most commonly diagnosed in older adults, although an increasing number of younger adults and teenagers are being diagnosed with this condition. People who are overweight, who eat a high calorie diet and who do not take regular exercise are more likely to develop this condition. People with a family member who have type 2 diabetes may be more likely to develop this condition. Women who developed diabetes during pregnancy may also be more likely to develop this condition.",Symptoms,"The early symptoms are an increased feeling of thirst, frequent urination and the production of large volumes of urine. People with diabetes often feel tired all the time, and may lose weight. Many people, however, do not have any symptoms during the early stages and are diagnosed during routine testing. Later symptoms include frequent infections (for example, skin or bladder infections), slow healing of wounds, blurred vision, and pain or numbness in the feet or hands.",Diagnosis,"The diagnosis is often based on the symptoms and testing the amount of sugar in the blood. If is unclear if a person has diabetes, the diagnosis is made by undergoing a glucose tolerance test, during which a measured amount of glucose is given, and the levels of sugar in blood are measured over a period of time, to see if the body is taking up the glucose as expected.",Treatment,"The treatment of type 2 diabetes aims to keep blood sugar levels in the normal range, to improve the body's response to insulin and to prevent the development of any complications. The first steps of treatment involve increasing physical exercise, improving the diet and maintaining a healthy weight. However, medications or insulin may become necessary over time to reduce blood sugar levels. As the condition progresses, education about using insulin may be needed, including self-monitoring and managing emergencies. Specialist diabetic educators are helpful in providing information and support at all stages of treatment. Regular follow-up is important in order to detect and prevent consequences, such as eye damage and nerve damage.",Prevention,"Maintaining a healthy weight, eating a healthy diet and taking regular exercise can help to prevent some cases of type 2 diabetes."

The genital area
The buttocks
The lower back
The abdomen
The inner thighs
","Most often found in babies, it is also known as:[1]","
Nappy rash
Diaper dermatitis
Irritant diaper dermatitis.
","Diaper rash is a type of inflammation most often caused by wetness, skin sensitivity, or chafing, though it can also be caused by certain medications or chemicals.","While uncomfortable, it is usually a mild condition that can be successfully treated at home.",Prevalence,"One of the more common conditions among infants, diaper rash affects as many as one in three babies at any given time,[2] with boys and girls being equally susceptible. It ranges from mild to moderate to severe irritation.",Mild diaper rash: Manifests as a faint pinkness that is limited to a small area and does not usually cause distress to the infant.,"Moderate to severe diaper rash: Tends to be brighter red and more widespread, and it may feature noticeable swelling, blisters and ulcerated areas. The resultant pain can cause significant distress. This type of nappy rash should be checked for signs of infection.[1]","Parents and caregivers can prevent diaper rash by changing their baby’s diapers often and promptly, especially when there is stool present. It is recommended that they cleanse the skin gently but thoroughly, making sure the area under the diaper is dry, and apply barrier creams when necessary.","Many parents feel ashamed when their child develops diaper rash, because they believe they have been neglectful somehow. However, even the most careful parents have to deal with it. Almost every baby will experience the condition at least once.","Provided that the rash is treated properly, it usually disappears within a few days and does not have any long-term health effects.",Symptoms,"It is important to determine whether the skin irritation is mild or severe. Usually, it is fairly easy to make this distinction. One of the first signs of diaper rash is redness in the area that is usually covered by the diaper. In mild cases, this can be a faint pinkness. Other symptoms include the following:",Mild diaper rash,The following symptoms are typical of mild diaper rash:,"
Pink or red patches
A few scattered pimples
Slight scaling and dryness
Stinging sensation when passing urine or feces

Try an asessment on the Ada app.",Causes,There are many different possible causes of diaper rash and sometimes there is more than one irritant to blame at one time. The following are the most likely causes:[3],"
Prolonged exposure to urine and feces: The wetness and ammonia can irritate the skin
Friction (chafing): The diaper may rub against the skin, causing irritation. This often happens when the diaper is too tight or, in older babies, when grains of sand or crumbs get under the diaper while they are playing or eating
Sensitive skin: Conditions such as eczema and seborrheic dermatitis may increase the risk of a baby developing diaper rash. However, these conditions are usually not limited to the diaper area
Intolerance to a product: The skin may react to one of the ingredients in a new product, such as baby wipes, lotions, soaps, different brands of disposable diapers, and detergents and softeners used on cloth diapers.
New foods in the diet: Diaper rash often develops when a baby starts eating solid foods. The content and frequency of their stools can change, causing skin irritation. Breast-fed infants can also develop diaper rash in reaction to something their mother has eaten.
Yeast or bacterial infection: The warmth and moisture of the diaper area make it susceptible to bacteria and yeast (candida) infections. The creases of the skin are particularly vulnerable and may become red, with scattered red dots nearby.
Antibiotics: By killing good bacteria along with the bad, antibiotics, whether taken by an infant or their breastfeeding mother, can upset the balance of the skin flora. Yeast infections can develop as a result. Antibiotics can also cause diarrhea, which irritates the skin.
","If the diaper rash does not go away despite resolution of the suspected causes, a doctor’s opinion should be sought to:","
Identify the triggers
Treat the rash
Prevent it from recurring or worsening.
",Diagnosis,"Doctors usually diagnose diaper rashes by taking a history and conducting a physical examination. Unless they suspect an allergy or rare deficiency, they are unlikely to perform laboratory tests.[4]","A medical practitioner will be able to differentiate diaper rash from other skin conditions such as eczema and seborrheic dermatitis, and advise on the best course of action. In the case of mild diaper rash, a home diagnosis is usually made by caregivers, based on the symptoms presented by the infant.",Treatment,"Mild cases of diaper rash can be treated at home, without a visit to the doctor or special medications. Taking simple steps to improve the infant’s skin care will usually clear the rash.",Home remedies for diaper rash,Leave the diaper off for as long as possible. This will allow the area to air-dry and aid healing. You can lay the infant on an absorbent towel if necessary. The following steps can also be taken:,"
Changing diapers frequently, including at night.
Cleaning the skin with warm water, using a gentle, fragrance-free soap if necessary. Avoid wipes, as these can be irritating. Take care not to rub too hard, and always wipe the genital area from front to back.
After cleaning, pat the skin dry with a soft cloth or allow it to air-dry.
Bathing the infant no more than twice a day to stop the skin drying out.
Avoiding baby powders as they can aggravate the inflammation.
Gently applying a barrier cream or ointment after diaper changes. This will reduce the contact between skin and waste products, helping to prevent further irritation. Zinc cream, zinc oxide and petroleum jelly are all options. Natural alternatives, such as creams containing marigold extract, are available too. A pharmacist will be able to advise on which product to use.[2]
Ensuring that the diaper is not too tight.
Trying a different brand of diaper to see if it might help.
Using fragrance-free, hypoallergenic detergents and softeners when washing cloth diapers and baby clothing.
Introducing new foods slowly to see whether there is a connection.[5]
If a food item seems to be problematic, removing it from the baby’s diet for a few days and reintroducing it slowly, checking for a reaction.

When this infection spreads from the lungs and affects other organs, it is called disseminated (widespread) tuberculosis. Symptoms depend upon the organ systems affected by the disease, but common symptoms include fever, chills, night sweats, weight loss and tiredness. The diagnosis involves taking a sample from the infected organ to prove the presence of an infection. The treatment of disseminated tuberculosis usually involves taking a combination of antibiotics for 6 to 12 months. Most people recover well, although it does take time for the symptoms to improve. People who may be experiencing symptoms linked to disseminated tuberculosis can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.",Risks,"Tuberculosis is very infectious.The bacteria that causes tuberculosis, is spread through the air and via droplets from the mouth or throat of an infected person.

Typical symptoms include changes in bowel habits (alternating diarrhea and constipation), bloating, nausea, vomiting and belly pain. If the diverticula are infected and inflamed, they may cause fever, belly pain and blood and pus in the stool. Symptoms are due to inflammation, irritation and sometimes infections forming in the out-pouching of the bowel.",Diagnosis,The diagnosis is usually made on the basis of medical history and physical examination. A computed tomography (CT) scan may be needed to identify the location of the inflammation in the bowel and confirm the diagnosis.,Treatment,"Treatment is based on the severity and stage of diverticular disease. Affected people with no symptoms usually do not need treatment. People who have diverticulitis (infection and inflammation of the pouches) may receive antibiotics to treat the infection. In severe or complicated cases, surgery might be needed to stop bleeding, drain pus, or even remove parts of the bowel. However this is very uncommon.",Risks,"The risk of getting diverticular disease and diverticulitis increases with age, and most commonly affects people older than 60 years of age. Eating a low-fiber diet (a diet high in processed foods) has often been seen as a cause, although the link is not clear.",Prognosis,Many people with diverticular disease do not have symptoms and do not require any treatment. Diverticulitis (inflammation and infection of the pouches) is often treated with antibiotics and people recover well if there are no complications. Some people may experience recurrent episodes of diverticulitis. Younger people may have a higher risk of severe disease and recurrence.,Prevention,Eating foods which are high in fiber may help prevent diverticular disease and episodes of inflammation of the pouches (diverticulitis).,Other names for diverticulitis,"

,,,,,,,,,,What is dry eye syndrome (Keratoconjunctivitis sicca)?
,,,,,,,,,,What is dry eye syndrome (Keratoconjunctivitis sicca)?,"Keratoconjunctivitis sicca – or dry eye syndrome – is a common dysfunction of the eyes, characterized by its principal symptom of dry eyes. Besides a feeling of dryness, other symptoms include irritation, grittiness and redness of the eyes, as well as the release of a thick discharge from the eyes and blurred vision.[1]","Dry eye syndrome occurs when the glands of the eyes cannot produce tears or produce insufficient quantities of tears, when tears evaporate too quickly or when there is an imbalance in the amount of oil, water and mucus in the tear fluid. Although there are numerous potential causes of dry eyes, some of the most common causes are extended use of contact lenses, long periods spent in front of a TV or computer screen, aging, certain medical conditions (including diabetes, Sjögren syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis) and certain medications (including antihistamines, decongestants and antidepressants).[2]","There are numerous treatment options available for dry eye syndrome, with the choice of treatment dependent on the underlying cause, the symptoms and the severity of the condition. These can range from simple environmental changes and over-the-counter eye drops to medication and – in persistent cases – surgery.",Dry eye syndrome (Keratoconjunctivitis sicca) symptoms,"The symptoms of dry eye syndrome are mild in most instances; however, even mild but persistent symptoms can be extremely troublesome and difficult to treat. The symptoms of dry eye syndrome usually affect both eyes.",Common symptoms include:[3],"
Dry, gritty and sore eyes
Irritation and redness of the eyes
Temporarily blurred vision (which will usually improve after blinking)
A feeling of tired or strained eyes
","If any of the symptoms of dry eye syndrome persist or cause serious pain, medical attention should be sought.",Causes of dry eye syndrome (Keratoconjunctivitis sicca),"Tears are composed of a mixture of oil, water and mucus – a combination that ensures the surface of the eyes remain smooth and clear, as well as protecting the eyes from infection.[4] Dry eye syndrome is caused when the glands of the eyes are unable create an adequate amount of tears, when tears evaporate too rapidly or when there is an imbalance in the composition of tears.",Deficiency of tears,One common cause of dry eye syndrome is an inability of the glands in the eyes to produce enough tears to keep them moist. Typical reasons for this include:[5],"
Medical conditions including diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, lupus, Sjögren syndrome, thyroid disorders and vitamin A deficiency
Aging
Certain medications including decongestants; antihistamines; hormone replacement therapy; antidepressants; medications used to treat high blood pressure, acne and Parkinson’s disease; as well as birth control drugs
Laser eye surgery (this effect is usually temporary)
Damage to the tear glands from inflammation or radiation
",Evaporation of tears,Another common cause of dry eye syndrome is the evaporation of tears at an increased rate. Causes of this can include:,"
Dry, windy or smoky environments
Blinking less often (typically when reading, driving or concentrating intensely)
Problems with the eyelids such as ectropion (out-turning of the eyelids) or entropion (in-turning of the eyelids)
",Imbalance in tear composition,"The tear film that coats the eyes is composed of three substances, each with a different role within the eye:[6]","
An oily outer layer (lipid) produced by the meibomian glands which prevents tears from evaporating too quickly.
A watery middle layer (aqueous) produced by the tear glands which helps nourish the cornea and the conjunctiva.
A mucous inner layer produced by goblet cells which helps bind water to the eyes, helping them to stay moist.
","Dry eye syndrome can result from problems with any one of these layers. For example, the meibomian glands can become blocked, resulting in decreased production of oils or the production of lower-quality oils.[7]",Diagnosing dry eye syndrome (Keratoconjunctivitis sicca),"Those experiencing any of the symptoms of dry eye syndrome – dryness, irritation, blurred vision, etc. – should visit a doctor or ophthalmologist as soon as possible. Based on the symptoms, tests may be done to assess the severity of the symptoms and dryness.",Tests include:[8],"
Fluorescein eye test: Fluorescent eye drops are used to highlight the tears in the eyes, enabling a specialist to monitor how tears are being produced and how quickly they are evaporating. The drops may also show any damage to the surface of the eye.
Schirmer’s test: Blotting paper is placed over the lower eyelids and left for five minutes. The wetness of the paper determines the diagnosis, with less than 10 mm indicating the presence of dry eye syndrome.
Lissamine green test: A strip of paper containing a special dye is placed over the surface of the eyes, allowing specialists to identify any damage to the surface of the eye.
",Dry eye syndrome (Keratoconjunctivitis sicca) treatment,"After being diagnosed with dry eye syndrome, a specialist will recommend a treatment route appropriate to the underlying cause, the specific symptoms and the severity of the condition. There is no cure for dry eye syndrome, but it can be effectively managed.",Treatment may involve:[9],"
Eye drops: Drops to artificially increase the moisture in the eyes is the most common treatment option. These may be prescribed by a specialist but are also available over the counter.
Medication: The most common drug used to combat chronic dry eye syndrome caused by ocular inflammation is cyclosporine. This anti-inflammatory medication is given as eye drops and helps to increase tear production by the tear glands.
Medication change: If a medication used to treat another condition is identified as the cause of dry eye syndrome, a doctor may prescribe an alternative.
Surgery: Surgical treatment is reserved for severe cases of dry eye syndrome. The procedure will usually involve blocking the tear drainage holes in the inner eye using lacrimal (punctal) plugs. This is reversible but can be used as a permanent solution.
",Dry eye syndrome (Keratoconjunctivitis sicca) prevention,"Prevention of dry eye syndrome may involve regulating environmental conditions and making small lifestyle changes. Avoiding dry climates and using a humidifier to increase the moisture in the air can be effective, as can avoiding smokey and windy conditions. Taking frequent time out while driving, using a computer or reading can help to refresh the tear film and prevent the eyes from drying out.",Dry eye syndrome (Keratoconjunctivitis sicca) FAQs,"Q: Are there any home remedies for dry eye syndrome (Keratoconjunctivitis sicca)?
A: Yes, there are a number of home remedies for dry eye syndrome. These include:[10]","
Warm compresses: Irritation can be reduced and the meibomian glands declogged through the application of a warm compress. This treatment consists of wetting a cloth with warm water, placing it over the eyes and gently dabbing the corners of the eyes. This may be necessary every day.
Hygiene: Keeping the eyelids and areas surrounding the eyes (including the lashes) clean can help prevent dry eye syndrome and ease the condition’s symptoms. A small amount of mild cleanser or shampoo can be used to clean this area. Avoiding excessive touching of the eyes can also help keep the eyes clean.
Hydration: A person can stay hydrated by drinking large amounts (8 to 10 glasses daily) of water. This can help the eyes stay moist.
Diet and supplements: A deficiency of certain proteins and vitamins may in some cases contribute to the onset or the severity of dry eye syndrome. In these cases, foods rich in Omega-3 and supplements containing Omega-3 may be recommended as a treatment option. Consuming foods high in flaxseed oil (such as pasta and cereals) or flaxseed oil supplements can also help ease the symptoms of the condition.
","If symptoms persist despite the use of any home remedy, or if any adverse effects result, medical attention should be sought promptly.","Q: Should I be worried about blurred vision as a result of dry eye syndrome (Keratoconjunctivitis sicca)?
A: Temporarily blurred vision can be a symptom of dry eye syndrome. Typically, it is little more than an inconvenience and can be managed through various treatment options. However, those who experience blurred vision should seek medical attention, as, in rare cases, it can be a symptom of more serious conditions such as eye disease.[11]","Q: What can I do when my eyes feel dry?
A: If your eyes begin to feel dry during activities such as driving, reading or using a computer, it is a good idea to take frequent breaks to allow the tear film to refresh. You should also remember to blink frequently. Laying a damp cloth over your eyes may also be effective in re-moisturising the eyes.","Q: Is there a surgical method of treatment for dry eye syndrome (Keratoconjunctivitis sicca)?
A: Yes, a minor, non-invasive surgical procedure to insert lacrimal (punctal) plugs can be used to treat dry eye syndrome. These plugs are small devices which are placed into the opening of the tear ducts in the eyes. Lacrimal plugs work by blocking the drainage of tears from the eyes, keeping them lubricated. Lacrimal plugs will generally only be recommended once other treatment methods have proven unsuccessful.[12]","Q: What is the relationship between dry eye syndrome and meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD)
A: MGD is among the leading causes of dry eye syndrome. The condition occurs when the glands responsible for the oily layer of the tear film (located inside the eyelids, with their openings on the edge of the eyelids) cease to function, preventing the oily component of tears from being released and causing the watery component of tears to dry out more quickly. There exists several treatment methods for MGD.[13]","Q: What is the relationship between dry eye syndrome and Sjögren syndrome?
A: Sjögren syndrome is an autoimmune disorder which has as its principal symptoms a dryness of the eyes and mouth. As such, Sjögren syndrome is one of the leading causes of dry eye syndrome."

,,,,,,,,,,What is ebola virus disease?,Ebola virus disease is an infectious condition caused by the Ebola virus. It leads to an illness characterized by fever and bleeding. The transmission occurs through direct contact with contaminated body fluids. Symptoms usually appear between 2 to 21 days after infection and people are infectious once they start showing symptoms. There is still no cure but good care increases the chances of defeating the virus. Prevention is essential to reduce viral transmission.,Risks,"This condition is caused by a highly contagious virus. Transmission occurs through contact with body fluids, such as blood, sweat, urine, saliva (spit) and broken skin. People exposed to objects contaminated with these fluids, animals or people with the illness have an increased risk of infection. Although highly contagious, the virus does not spread through the air or by touch. Ebola virus is found in West Africa, so people who live or travel to countries with Ebola are at increased risk of catching the virus.",Symptoms,"The symptoms of Ebola infection usually appear between 2 to 21 days after infection. People with Ebola infection are infectious once they begin to show symptoms. The early symptoms of Ebola infection are very similar with those of flu or malaria, with fever, sweating, muscle aches and headaches. Later symptoms include stomach aches, diarrhea, vomiting, bruising and bleeding from the mouth, eyes, ears and bowel.",Diagnosis,"The early symptoms of Ebola infection are very similar with those of flu or malaria, so early diagnosis can be difficult. Blood tests are used to confirm the infection by Ebola virus. If symptoms are not seen within 21 days this condition is excluded.",Treatment,There is not currently a cure or licensed vaccine for the Ebola Virus. Medical care is necessary to prevent dehydration and to maintain vital functions (especially blood pressure). Blood transfusions are often necessary to replace losses from bleeding.,Prevention,"Prevention is very important to control outbreaks of this virus. People with Ebola infection are infectious once they begin to show symptoms, so if a person is at risk of having Ebola, it is important to take care until the cause of illness is confirmed.

,,,,,,,,,,What is an ectopic pregnancy?
,,,,,,,,,,What is an ectopic pregnancy?,"An ectopic pregnancy, also known as an extrauterine pregnancy, is a fairly common pregnancy complication, in which a fertilized egg implants and develops outside of the uterus, also known as the womb. The word ectopic means ‘out of place’. In about 95 percent of cases, the fertilized ovum, also known as an egg, implants in one of the fallopian tubes. This is often due to scarring from previous infection or other abnormalities in the pelvic area, but it can also happen without a clear cause.","The symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy include vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain and absence of menstruation. However, some people experience symptoms that are similar to those found in gastroenteritis, also known as stomach flu, and miscarriage.[1] Ectopic pregnancy may also be asymptomatic.","While most people make a good recovery from an ectopic pregnancy, the condition can be life -threatening if left untreated. An ectopic pregnancy cannot be moved to the uterus to grow normally and almost never survives until birth. It may pass out of the cervix on its own, though medical or surgical intervention is normally required. [2]","Many people experience emotional distress after an ectopic pregnancy, particularly if it occurs during a planned pregnancy. A range of therapeutic treatment options are available.","If you are concerned that you may have an ectopic pregnancy, you can use the Ada app to find out what the problem is.",Symptoms,"If symptoms of ectopic pregnancy occur, they typically appear early on in the pregnancy, sometimes before a person realizes they are pregnant.",Early signs of ectopic pregnancy,The most common early signs and symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy include:[2][3][4],"
Lower stomach pain. Ectopic pregnancy pain is often located on one side of the body
Vaginal bleeding, which may be dark, watery and heavier, lighter or more prolonged than a normal period
Pregnancy symptoms such as a missed menstrual period, breast tenderness, frequent urination or nausea
","However, it is possible to have an ectopic pregnancy without any of the above symptoms.",Other signs of ectopic pregnancy,Less common symptoms include:,"
Bowel and bladder problems, such as diarrhea, and pain when defecating or urinating
A feeling of fullness when lying down that is not associated with eating, particularly in people who have already had a child
Back pain
","It is possible to have an ectopic pregnancy without experiencing any symptoms until rupture of the fallopian tube or close organs. After rupture, signs and symptoms may include:[3]","
Severe stomach pain
Vaginal bleeding
Lightheadedness, sometimes followed by fainting
Shoulder pain, described as a strange pain that feels different to any pain that a person has otherwise experienced, located at the tip of the shoulder, where it joins the arm, caused by internal bleeding
","If you are concerned that you may have an ectopic pregnancy, you can use the Ada app for a free symptom assessment.",Causes,"When a person becomes pregnant, the sperm and the egg, also known as an ovum, join in the fallopian tube, the tube that carries the ovum from the ovary to the uterus. Usually, the fertilized egg passes along the fallopian tube and into the uterus and implants into the lining of the uterus, known as the endometrium,  where it will grow and develop.","Ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized egg implants and starts to grow outside the uterus, usually in a fallopian tube. This is often due to scarring from previous infections or other abnormalities in the tube’s shape, for instance a birth defect.","As the ectopic pregnancy gets bigger, it can run out of space to grow and rupture the fallopian tube, causing severe pain and internal bleeding. Rarely, an ectopic pregnancy can also occur in other places, such as the ovary or inside the abdomen.",Risk factors,"The following factors may not be the sole cause of a person experiencing an ectopic pregnancy, but they are linked to a heightened risk of ectopic pregnancy:[3][5]","Previous ectopic pregnancy: If a person has experienced an ectopic pregnancy already, they have an increased risk of having another one.","Fertility treatment: Embryo transfer during in vitro fertilization (IVF) can occasionally result in ectopic pregnancy if, for example, an embryo travels into the fallopian tube.","Infertility: Women with infertility have a two or three times higher risk of ectopic pregnancy, possibly reflecting the increased number of people in this group who have tubal abnormalities, which may also be a cause of infertility.[6]",Age: The risk of ectopic pregnancy increases with age.,"Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID): Previous infection of the pelvic region, commonly chlamydia and gonorrhea, can sometimes damage the fallopian tubes.","Tubal sterilization: People who become pregnant after tubal sterilization, either because it has failed or because they have had it reversed, are at higher risk.","Cesarean section: An embryo can implant in the scar tissue of the uterus lining, caused by cesarean section.","Copper contraceptive coil (IUD): IUDs ensure a very low risk of any pregnancy, either intrauterine or ectopic. However, if a person does conceive, the probability of the pregnancy being ectopic is higher than in women not using an IUD.[3] An IUD is still more protective against ectopic pregnancy than not using contraception.",Smoking tobacco: This can hinder the transfer of the ovum to the uterus by decreasing the ability of the muscles in the fallopian tube walls to contract.,"In-utero diethylstilbestrol (DES) exposure: Exposure before birth to DES, a synthetic form of the female hormone estrogen that was prescribed to pregnant women from the 1940s to 1970s to prevent pregnancy complications, has been found to increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy by about four times.[6]",Types of ectopic pregnancy,The kind of ectopic pregnancy a person has depends on where the fertilized egg implants.,Fallopian pregnancy,"Also known as tubal pregnancy, a fallopian ectopic pregnancy can be further divided into three sub-types:","
Ampullary (in the middle part of the fallopian tube), accounting for 80% of ectopic pregnancies
Isthmic (in the upper part of the fallopian tube close to the uterus), accounting for 12% of ectopic pregnancies
Fimbrial (at the end of the tube),  accounting for 5% of ectopic pregnancies
","The tube has a delicate structure made up of cilia, which are tiny hair-like projections, and mucus-producing cells, which work together to propel an ovum, fertilized in the fallopian tube, to the uterus to implant, over the space of about four days.","Sometimes, the transportation of the developing embryo is slow, perhaps for reasons of inflammation or infection of the fallopian tube or for no obvious reason. In such cases, it can implant in the fallopian tube.",About 95 percent of ectopic pregnancies occur in the fallopian tube.,Other types of ectopic pregnancy,"There are other types of ectopic pregnancies, all of which are rare. These include:[7]","Interstitial pregnancy: This occurs in the part of the fallopian tube embedded in the uterus wall. It is typically hard to diagnose and can therefore be particularly dangerous, as it may progress further and rupture later, damaging both the fallopian tube and the uterus wall.","Cervical ectopic pregnancy: Pregnancy in the cervix – the passage between the womb and vagina – is one of the rarest forms of ectopic pregnancy and carries a risk of life-threatening vaginal hemorrhage. This is due to the possibility of heavy bleeding when the ectopic pregnancy tissue separates from the cervix, which contains many blood vessels.","Ovarian ectopic pregnancy: This is typically difficult to diagnose, as it can appear very similar to a tubal ectopic pregnancy that is stuck to the ovary. It is usually not diagnosed until surgery, when partial or complete removal of the ovary will usually be necessary.","Cesarean scar ectopic pregnancies: This occurs when a fertilized egg implants into the scar from a cesarean section. The pregnancy can grow out of the uterus or into the cervix, which can lead to massive internal or vaginal bleeding. In some cases, the fetus may be able to survive until birth, but with the risk of significant maternal bleeding and removal of the womb, known as hysterectomy, at delivery.","Intramural pregnancy: This is a difficult-to-diagnose pregnancy that implants outside of the womb cavity, but within its muscular wall. It may occur if the uterus is scarred from surgery or if a condition called adenomyosis is present, in which the inner lining of the uterus breaks through the muscle wall of the uterus.","Abdominal pregnancy: Pregnancies in the abdomen are thought to start as tubal pregnancies, before separating from the wall of the fallopian tube and passing into the abdominal cavity, where they reattach. These can take many weeks before showing symptoms.","Heterotopic pregnancy: This term describes the co-existence of an intrauterine pregnancy and an ectopic pregnancy. The intrauterine twin is able to survive until birth in about one third of cases, after surgical treatment of the ectopic pregnancy.",Diagnosis,Diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy usually begins with a physical exam and taking the person’s medical history. A person may be referred to a gynecology clinic for further assessment.,"Ectopic pregnancies are most commonly diagnosed using a combination of tests, including:","
Ultrasound
Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test
Laparoscopy (keyhole surgery) if the previous exam results are still ambiguous
","Good to know: Diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy can be delayed because the symptoms are often similar to other, more well-known conditions, such as gastroenteritis, appendicitis or miscarriage. For more information, see the resource about signs of miscarriage.",Ultrasound,Ultrasound is an imaging technique which uses soundwaves to create an image of the developing pregnancy. It is a painless and non-invasive procedure which can be performed in two different ways:[8],"
Transvaginally: A scanning probe is inserted into the vagina.
Transabdominally: Gel is spread onto the skin of the lower abdomen, and the scanner is passed over the area.
","In diagnosing an ectopic pregnancy, doctors will look for where the pregnancy is located in the ultrasound images. These can help them determine whether the person’s symptoms are being caused by an ectopic pregnancy, a healthy pregnancy or another condition. Ultrasound indicators for ectopic pregnancy include:[9]","No pregnancy in the uterus, or a gestation sac in the uterus missing an embryo: This is a pregnancy of unknown location (PUL). This is a label given until the pregnancy location can be found, and a diagnosis can be given. Many of these will not be ectopic and will not need treatment.",No pregnancy in the uterus and a possible mass in the area of a fallopian tube: This would likely lead to diagnosis of a possible ectopic pregnancy.,hCG test for ectopic pregnancy,"Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a hormone produced by the placenta, an organ that develops in the womb during pregnancy. A beta hCG blood test can detect hCG in the blood approximately 11 days after conception and establish the precise amount of hCG present. This might be used if a person has been pregnant for six weeks, but an ultrasound scan does not show a developing pregnancy in the uterus. The test may be repeated at intervals to measure changes in hCG levels.[10]",Possible indicators for ectopic pregnancy from a beta hCG blood test include:[11],"
Declining hCG levels: This can be an indicator that the ectopic pregnancy has ended and is self-resolving or will be miscarried in the coming days or weeks.
Slow rising hCG levels: If the levels rise more slowly than in a normal pregnancy, it is likely that the pregnancy is ectopic.
","In a healthy pregnancy, hCG levels in the blood double about every two to four days throughout the first trimester, reaching their peak after 8-11 weeks and then decreasing before plateauing during the second trimester.",Laparoscopic diagnosis,"Rarely, laparoscopy, a type of keyhole surgery, is used to confirm the diagnosis, if hCG and ultrasound results are ambiguous. Under general anesthetic, a laparoscope, a narrow instrument with a camera and light on the end, is inserted through a small cut, usually into the belly button, to look at the pelvis. If an ectopic pregnancy is found, treatment to remove it may take place during the same operation.[3]",Treatment,"An ectopic pregnancy can be life threatening if left untreated and normally requires medical or surgical intervention to remove it. However, in some cases, when it is diagnosed early, ectopic pregnancy may be monitored to see if it will resolve on its own.",Treatment options depend on:[12],"
HCG levels
How many weeks pregnant the affected person is
Size and impact of the ectopic pregnancy as shown on an ultrasound
Pain levels
General health
The options the hospital has available
Personal views and preferences, such as future pregnancy plans
",Expectant management,"Also known as conservative or wait-and-see management, expectant management involves waiting to see if the ectopic pregnancy tissue passes out of the cervix on its own, instead of undergoing immediate treatment.",Expectant management is only offered as an option in some cases of very early diagnosis. Candidates for expectant management of ectopic pregnancy should:[13],"
Be asymptomatic
Show signs that the ectopic pregnancy is resolving, such as declining beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-HCG) levels
Not show signs of rupture
Not show signs of hemodynamic instability (abnormal blood pressure)
Have easy access to a hospital and be prepared to continue with follow-up
Be willing to accept the potential risks of tubal rupture
",The approach involves close monitoring by medical professionals through repeated blood tests to check that hCG levels are dropping. It can take a few weeks or sometimes months for this to happen. About half of ectopic pregnancies may resolve on their own where there is a drop in hCG levels.,"If a person develops new symptoms, another ultrasound scan may be done, and treatment options will be reassessed. Medical or surgical intervention may be required if it does not complete as planned.[14]",Medical management with methotrexate for ectopic pregnancy,"Sometimes, an ectopic pregnancy may be treated with a medication called methotrexate. This stops the growth of the embryo and typically allows surgery to be avoided. Medical management may be suitable if a diagnosis has been made very early.",Treatment with methotrexate is an especially attractive option if the pregnancy is located in the cervix or ovary or in the interstitial or the cornual portion of the tube. Surgical treatment in these cases is often associated with an increased risk of hemorrhage.,"Methotrexate is administered as an injection, usually a single shot into the buttock muscle. After the injection, there may be an overnight stay in hospital, and regular follow-up visits will be needed for a few weeks to monitor hCG levels until they return to normal. Some people will need a second injection of methotrexate. Very occasionally, surgery will still be required.","Some pain is likely in the first few days after the injection, but this can usually be controlled with paracetamol. Certain substances should be avoided during treatment, including:[3]","
Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), e.g., ibuprofen or naprosyn, as they can interact with methotrexate and reduce its effectiveness
Alcoholic beverages, as the liver will be working hard to metabolise methotrexate
Supplements containing folic acid, as this can interact with methotrexate, preventing it from achieving the desired effect
","Good to know: Apart from being used as a medication for ectopic pregnancy, methotrexate is a chemotherapy drug and immune system suppressant used to treat a variety of other conditions. It can cause significant side-effects. However, the dose to treat ectopic pregnancy is much lower and is unlikely to cause severe problems.[12]",Ectopic pregnancy removal with surgery,"There are two possible aims for surgical management, which will be decided depending on damage to the affected fallopian tube and the condition of the other tube. These are:[12][13]","Total salpingectomy: This involves removal of the tube containing the ectopic pregnancy and is normally recommended for people who either do not want to have any children in future, who have had another ectopic pregnancy in the same fallopian tube, or who have severely damaged tubes. This reduces the risk of a persistent ectopic pregnancy, in which some ectopic cells are left behind and continue to grow, or further ectopic pregnancies. Total salpingectomy may also be chosen in cases of uncontrolled bleeding and abnormal blood pressure.","Linear salpingostomy: This is a more conservative approach, involving a surgical incision into a fallopian tube, which aims to remove the ectopic pregnancy without removing the tube. This is normally recommended for people who have an unruptured ectopic pregnancy in the ampullary (middle) portion of the tube. This may also be chosen if the person only has one tube, or their other tube does not seem to be healthy.

A doctor will discuss these with the person affected by ectopic pregnancy, before commencing treatment.[1]",Persistent ectopic pregnancy,"A persistent ectopic pregnancy may occur, in which some ectopic cells are left behind and continue to grow, or further ectopic pregnancies occur.","If there is no history of diseases of the fallopian tubes, the chances of having another ectopic pregnancy may not be much higher than in a person who has not previously had an ectopic pregnancy.","If a person has some of the risk factors for ectopic pregnancy, as listed above, then the risk of problems in the future increases.",Fertility problems following ectopic pregnancy,Most women will make a full recovery from ectopic pregnancy and will be able to conceive normally in future.,"Rarely, fertility may be affected, especially in the case of ruptured ectopic pregnancy or if a fallopian tube is removed in treatment.","If treatment has involved any kind of surgery, the risk of fertility problems is higher than if medical treatment or no treatment was needed.[1]",Ectopic pregnancy and emotions,"It is normal to feel distressed after an ectopic pregnancy. It can mean coming to terms with the loss of a baby, with a potential impact on future fertility or, for some, with the thought of having nearly lost their life. In some people, these emotions can develop into depression and anxiety if left untreated.","According to the Miscarriage Association, a  person with ectopic pregnancy may be emotionally affected in a variety of ways, including:[15]","Shock: A person may experience shock about the diagnosis, especially in cases where there has been emergency surgery or about what might have happened without diagnosis.",Loss and grief: It is normal to feel grief for the baby that was expected.,Feeling ‘in limbo’ and unable to move on: It is common to feel frustrated at having to wait some time before being able to try again and having to have follow-up and repeated blood and urine tests.,Counseling is available for people affected by an ectopic pregnancy. Support groups are also available and may be able to put a person in touch with others in a similar situation.,"A health professional will be able to provide advice on choosing the most appropriate kind of support for a person, couple or family who has experienced an ectopic pregnancy.",FAQs,"Q: How common is ectopic pregnancy?
A: About one in 50 pregnancies are ectopic.[16] Many early ectopic pregnancies resolve on their own, without treatment. Some ectopic pregnancies will resolve before they produce symptoms.","Q: Can a person have an ectopic pregnancy with a copper coil (IUD)?
A: IUDs ensure a very low risk of any pregnancy, either intrauterine or ectopic. However, if a person does conceive, the probability of the pregnancy being ectopic is higher than in women not using an IUD.[3] An IUD is still more protective against ectopic pregnancy than not using contraception.[16]","Q: Can a person have an ectopic pregnancy with IVF?
A: Yes, in vitro fertilization puts a person at higher risk of ectopic pregnancy. It may increase the occurrence of unusual types of ectopic pregnancies, such as heterotopic pregnancy, in which there is simultaneous intrauterine and tubal pregnancies, and interstitial pregnancy, which occurs in the part of the fallopian tube embedded in the uterus wall.[17]","Q: Is it possible to miscarry an ectopic pregnancy?
A: In the very early stages, the fetus may pass out of the cervix on its own, without the need for further treatment. This may result in some symptoms of miscarriage being present. As the fetus develops, it becomes less likely that it will pass out of the womb on its own, and medical or surgical management will be needed to remove it. However, the techniques used to treat ectopic pregnancy may differ from those used to treat incomplete miscarriage. See this resource on miscarriage for more information.","Q: Is prevention of ectopic pregnancy possible?
A: Preventing ectopic pregnancy is not normally possible. Adequate use of contraceptives significantly reduces the risk of ectopic pregnancy. A person may be able to prevent a tubal pregnancy in the fallopian tube, if things that scar the tube, such as smoking and exposure to sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), can be avoided.","In some cases of ectopic pregnancy, a person may have surgery to remove the tube containing the ectopic pregnancy, which will reduce the risk of further ectopic pregnancies or  persistent ectopic pregnancy. This occurs if some ectopic cells are left behind and continue to grow, or if there are subsequent ectopic pregnancies.",Other names for ectopic pregnancy,"

,,,,,,,,,,What is an electrocardiogram?
,,,,,,,,,,What is an electrocardiogram?,"An electrocardiogram, also known as an ECG or EKG, is a simple, painless procedure used to test and record the heart’s rhythm and electrical activity. During the procedure, small electrodes are attached to the skin, through which the heart’s electrical pulses can be monitored.","An electrocardiogram can be ordered by a heart specialist, also called a cardiologist, or a normal doctor to check for a variety of heart conditions, including heart attacks and arrhythmia, an irregular heartbeat. The procedure may be carried out at a doctor’s office or hospital and comes with no serious risks.[1]",Reasons for needing an electrocardiogram,An electrocardiogram is typically used in conjunction with other tests in order to diagnose or monitor various heart conditions.,"People experiencing chest pain (angina), heart palpitations, shortness of breath or other symptoms may be given an electrocardiogram in order to investigate the underlying causes of the problems.",The procedure is able to detect conditions including:[2],"
Atrial fibrillation: A condition that often causes irregular heartbeats
Tachycardia: When the heart beats faster than normal, especially while resting
Heart attacks (myocardial infarction): When the tissue of the heart muscle starts to die due to a sudden, significant reduction in the supply of oxygen-rich blood, most often caused by coronary heart disease[3][4]
Coronary heart disease: When the flow of blood to the heart is blocked by a buildup of plaque, a waxy material made up of fats, cholesterol, calcium and other substances, inside the blood vessels[5][6]
Cardiomyopathy: A thickening or enlargement of the walls of the heart
",An electrocardiogram may also be used to monitor the progress of a certain condition or to see how medication is affecting the heart.,"A normal reading from an electrocardiogram does not completely rule out heart problems, as conditions that come and go may not be detected by the test.[7] To overcome this problem, a portable ECG machine, called a Holter monitor, may be used. This device is worn continuously over 24 or 48 hours in order to monitor the heart as an individual goes about their daily life.[8]",Types of electrocardiogram,"There are three main types of electrocardiogram, of which one is selected depending on what kind of condition is being diagnosed or monitored.[9]","
Rest ECG: The most common type, carried out while the testee is lying down in a horizontal position
Exercise or stress ECG: Carried out while the testee is using a treadmill or exercise bike
Ambulatory ECG: A portable machine is used, allowing the test to be performed from home
",How is an electrocardiogram carried out?,"An electrocardiogram will usually be carried out in a hospital or doctor’s office. First, the testee will be asked to change into a hospital gown or to remove the clothes on their torso. Next, they will be asked to lie down on their back on a hospital bed.","Electrodes, usually 10 or 12, will be fixed to the torso and sometimes to the limbs. The electrodes are relatively small, sticky and attached to the electrocardiogram machine through wires. To secure the electrodes, hair on certain parts of the body may be shaved.","During the test – which will usually only takes a few minutes – the testee will be asked to breathe normally and avoid excessive movement or talking, as this may distort the results. The electrodes will monitor the electrical pulses of the heart, which are then recorded and printed as waves on a piece of paper.[10]",The procedure will be slightly different in the case of an exercise or ambulatory ECG.,Electrocardiogram results,"The results from an electrocardiogram will generally be displayed electronically or printed on paper. After they have been compiled, the results will typically be analyzed by a doctor or specialist before being shared. This may happen on the same day, or a person may be required to return to the hospital or doctor’s office at a later date.",Results from a healthy patient will usually show a consistent rhythm from the heart and a heart rate of between 60 and 100 beats per minute.[11],Risks associated with an electrocardiogram,An electrocardiogram is a very safe and painless procedure which is considered routine by healthcare providers. There is a slight risk of pain when the electrodes are removed and of a mild rash in the areas where they were applied.[12]
,,,,,,,,,,What is endocarditis?
,,,,,,,,,,What is endocarditis?,"Endocarditis is a rare infection of the inner lining of the heart (endocardium) and the
heart valves, usually caused by germs (or, less commonly, fungus) entering the bloodstream
and passing into the heart.[1] However, a rare, non-infective variant also exists. Non-infective
endocarditis is a build-up of clots on the endocardium or cardiac valves, caused by certain
medical conditions, including some types of cancer, pregnancy and trauma.[2]","Endocarditis treatment will usually involve a course of antibiotics and – in rare cases,
usually when complications arise – surgery. If left untreated, the condition can cause severe
damage to the heart and result in life-threatening complications. Early diagnosis is critical
to improving the prognosis of those with endocarditis.[3]",Symptoms of endocarditis,Symptoms of endocarditis may include:[4],"
Fever and chills
Fatigue and night sweats
Loss of appetite
Weight loss
Generally feeling unwell
Pain in the muscles or joints
Shortness of breath and coughing
Chest pain when breathing
Swelling of the legs, ankles or feet
",Less common symptoms may include:,"
Blood in the urine
Tenderness in the upper half of the abdomen
Red spots on the hands or feet
Red-purple bumps under the skin of the toes or fingers (Osler’s nodes)
Small red or purple spots on the skin, inside the mouth or on the whites of the eyes
Back pain
","Non-infective endocarditis will generally present fewer symptoms than infective endocarditis
and they are unlikely to develop until the later stages of the condition or when complications
arise. Symptoms of infective endocarditis can either develop slowly or rapidly (in a number
of days) depending on what kind of bacteria or fungi is causing the condition.","Complications can develop quickly, making the condition more difficult to treat. For this
reason, it is important to see a doctor early when worrying symptoms occur.",Causes of endocarditis,"Endocarditis most often occurs in people with preexisting heart disease (which may be
diagnosed or undiagnosed) and less commonly in people with normal hearts.","Endocarditis may occur when bacteria or fungi enter the bloodstream through small injuries
(such as those experienced during teeth cleaning), when injecting into the veins, during
surgery, or as a result of other infections. If the bacteria or fungi reach the heart, they
may settle on the endocardium (the heart’s inner lining or valves) and begin to grow – causing
an infection.","Ordinarily, the immune system is able to clear bacteria and fungi that enters the bloodstream.
When this does not happen, however, some bacteria or fungi can settle on the endocardium or
valves of the heart (especially likely if a valve is already damaged in some way) and form
small growths (vegetations). These growths can prevent the heart from functioning correctly
and may break off and infect other areas of the body.","While endocarditis is a rare condition, the following groups are most at risk:[5]","
People with previously damaged heart valves or an artificial heart valve
Users of injected drugs such as heroin
","It should also be noted that any procedure that requires placing medical devices into the
veins or any type of heart surgery can also be a risk factor.",Those most at risk of non-infective endocarditis include people with the following conditions:[6],"
Systemic lupus erythematosus
Antiphospholipid syndrome
Stomach, lung or pancreatic cancer
",Diagnosing endocarditis,"If a diagnosis of endocarditis is suspected based on the symptoms and medical history, a
thorough physical examination will be carried out, paying particular attention to the heart.[7]
In particular, doctor’s will listen for heart murmurs (unusual sounds from the heart), which
can be an indicator of the condition. A doctor will in most cases then also order a series
of tests to confirm the diagnosis.","Blood tests will be ordered in order to identify any bacteria or fungi present in the blood.
An ultrasound of the heart may also be able to show signs of any abnormal growths on the
heart valve, as well as any damage to the heart. Further diagnostic tests (X ray, CT, MRI,
ECG) can also be carried out to investigate any involvement in other organs .[8]","If blood tests reveal no sign of infection but other symptoms and risk factors are present,
the diagnosis of non-infective endocarditis may still be possible.[9]",Endocarditis treatment,"Many cases of (infective) endocarditis can be effectively treated with antibiotics or
antifungal medication. If the growth is very large, or if there is new or pre-existing
damage to the heart, surgery may be required.[10]",Antibiotics,"As soon as possible after diagnosis, an individual with infective endocarditis will be treated
with antibiotics, usually intravenously (through a drip). The course will last for several
weeks, a period through which most people will be required to stay in hospital.","If an individual continues to feel unwell after a number of days of treatment using antibiotics,
or if new symptoms occur, it is important to inform a doctor.",Surgery,"If the endocarditis causes severe damage to the heart, or infections are persistent, surgery
may be necessary. The goal is generally repair a damaged valve or replace a valve entirely.
Surgery can be life-saving, but it is a risky procedure with possible complications.",Treating non-infective endocarditis,"Treatment for non-infective endocarditis generally involves treating the underlying condition
that is its cause. Drugs to prevent the formation of new blood clots may be prescribed, but
this will depend on the doctor and the underlying causes of the condition.[11]",Endocarditis complications,Complications will generally arise if endocarditis is left untreated or if it is treated too late.,"The two most serious complications of endocarditis are heart failure and sepsis. If growths in the
heart break up and spread to other areas of the body, complications including abscesses, strokes and
– in some cases – seizures are possible.",Endocarditis prevention,"To help prevent endocarditis, it is important – especially for those who are particularly vulnerable
to the disorder – to be aware of its signs and symptoms. Through this awareness, if any signs or
symptoms occur, it will be possible to seek medical assistance without delay.","It is also important to maintain high standards of dental hygiene and to receive regular checkups
from a dentist. This will help prevent any bacteria from the mouth passing into the bloodstream.
Individuals should also avoid getting tattoos and piercings – activities that can lead to infection.","People with a known high risk of developing endocarditis may also be given preventative antibiotics
before dental or medical procedures. This decision, however, is left to the discretion of the doctor
or dentist.[12]","Users of injected drugs (such as heroin) should use only sterile syringes, needles and other apparatus,
and never share syringes with others in order to reduce the risk of infection.",Endocarditis prognosis,"Early diagnosis and treatment can improve the prognosis for endocarditis, with many people recovering
after receiving appropriate treatment. If left untreated, however, the condition often becomes
life-threatening. Older people, those with a particularly resistant infection, those with particularly
large growths and those with underlying medical conditions have a higher probability of experiencing
complications as a result of the condition.[13]","The prognosis for those with non-infective endocarditis is dependent on the underlying medical condition
that is the cause of the condition.[14]",Endocarditis FAQs,"Q: What is the prognosis for endocarditis?
A: The prognosis for endocarditis can be significantly improved if the condition is detected early and treatment begun quickly. If left untreated, the condition can be life-threatening. In cases of non-infective endocarditis, the prognosis depends on the severity of the symptoms and the cause of the condition.","Q: When should I seek medical attention for suspected endocarditis?
A: People who have an ongoing fever, chills and shortness of breath, or who have any other worrisome symptoms, should see a doctor for review of these symptoms. Those at higher risk of the condition (people with a damaged heart, those who have had a valve repair or replacement or injected drug users) should make themselves aware of the symptoms and see a doctor as soon as any of these they occur.","Q: Can I receive preventative treatment for endocarditis?
A: People at high risk of contracting endocarditis may be given preventative treatment, which will usually take the form of antibiotics to help the body combat a possible infection. People with a damaged heart, heart disease and users of injected drugs should consult a doctor about the possibility of using preventive treatment methods. A doctor will be able to assess the probability of endocarditis and explain the options from there. Preventative measures may be particularly important before surgical and dental procedures.[15]"

Treatment may consist of surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The recovery and outlook depends on the stage of the cancer at the time of diagnosis.",Risks,"Cancer occurs when a group of abnormal cells grows uncontrollably. These cells tend to destroy normal cells around them, and sometimes spread into other body areas through blood or lymph vessels. Endometrial cancer is a cancer originating from the cells which line the uterus. This condition is most common in women who have been through menopause (women over 50 years of age). Other factors that increase the risk of developing endometrial cancer include obesity; never having given birth; the use of hormone-containing medications (including tamoxifen to treat breast cancer, and hormone replacement therapy); and smoking. People who have a family member with endometrial cancer have a higher risk of developing this condition.",Symptoms,"The most common symptom is bleeding from the vagina after menopause. This might appear as spontaneous bleeding, or bleeding after sexual intercourse. Women who have not been through menopause may notice bleeding between periods. Other symptoms include pain felt low in the abdomen, or low belly pain during sexual intercourse.",Diagnosis,Diagnosis is usually made based on the symptoms and an ultrasound of the uterus. A tissue sample of the cancer (a biopsy) is taken and investigated to confirm the diagnosis.,Treatment,"Treatment of uterine cancer depends on the size of the cancer, the exact type of cancer and whether the cancer has spread. The combination of these factors determines the stage of the cancer. Depending on the stage, endometrial cancer can be treated by radiation therapy, surgery to remove the uterus, chemotherapy, or a combination of therapies.

,,,,,,,,,,What are endometrial polyps?
,,,,,,,,,,What are endometrial polyps?,"Endometrial polyps, also called uterine polyps, are growths in the interior of the uterus or womb, formed of an overgrowth of the cells (endometrium) that line this cavity. They may occur alone or in clusters and are typically less than a centimeter in diameter, but in rare cases can grow much larger – for example, to the size of a golf ball or an orange.[1][2]","Symptoms in adults, both pre and postmenopausal, commonly include unusual bleeding. Polyps are more common in people who have not yet experienced menopause than those who have. This may be because endometrial polyps seem to be reactive to estrogen levels. However, much is unknown about the formation of these polyps. They rarely occur in adolescents. Endometrial polyps can affect a woman’s fertility and, in rare cases, be linked to cancer.[1][2]",Uterine polyp symptoms,Common symptoms of endometrial polyps include:[1][2],"
Irregular menstrual bleeding. Menstrual bleeding that is shorter or longer in length than usual, or that occurs at unexpected times
Spotting or bleeding between menstrual periods
Unusually heavy bleeding during periods
Unusual appearance of brown blood after a menstrual period
Spotting or bleeding after menopause
Spotting or bleeding after sexual intercourse
Severe menstrual cramping, though this is uncommon
Infertility
","Many of these symptoms do not arise from the formation of the polyp itself, but because of rubbing and irritation of the surrounding tissue. Most endometrial polyps are small, and many people who experience them will never develop symptoms. Pain is not a typical symptom of uterine polyps.[3]","People experiencing possible symptoms of endometrial polyps should seek medical attention. In addtion, the free Ada app can be used to carry out a symptom assessment.",Endometrial polyp causes,"Endometrial polyps are caused by the overgrowth of endometrial tissue, which is the lining of the uterus that swells and then shrinks during the menstrual cycle. Endometrial polyps are estrogen-sensitive, with hormones in the bloodstream playing a role in their occurrence.[2][4]",Risk factors,"Women over 40 who have not experienced menopause, and those who have had children, are considered to be at greater risk of developing endometrial polyps. Other risk factors include:[1][2][5][6]","
Going through perimenopause
Hormone replacement therapy after menopause, particularly where the dose of estrogen is high
Obesity
Treatment with the medication tamoxifen for breast cancer, after menopause
","Endometrial polyps may recur. People who have had polyps in the past are somewhat more likely to develop them in the future, compared to those who have never had them.[1][3]",People worried about developing endometrial polyps can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.,Diagnosis of endometrial polyps,"Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) is the first-line method for evaluating women with abnormal vaginal bleeding. During a TVUS, a thin, wand-like device is placed inside the vagina and uterus, where it emits ultrasonic waves. The doctor may be able to identify a uterine polyp by examining this ultrasound.[2]","If the ultrasound finding is uncertain, there are two other options. One is where the physician carries out a more specialized ultrasound, called a sonohysterography or a saline infusion sonogram (SIS). In this procedure, the doctor injects a small amount of saline into the uterus to expand the uterine cavity and provide a clearer picture.[2]","The second option, should a TVUS be uncertain, is a hysteroscopy. This allows a more direct view of the inside of the uterus, using a hysteroscope: a lighted camera mounted on a flexible rod. The hysteroscope may be equipped with an additional tool to gather a biopsy sample. A suction catheter could also be used to gather an endometrial biopsy. The tissue sample will then be analyzed to see if it indicates uterine cancer.[2]",Treatments for endometrial polyps,"Small, asymptomatic polyps in people before menopause often require no treatment, but will instead be monitored for changes or an increase in symptoms.[2]","A short-term option to address the symptoms of endometrial polyps is the use of hormonal treatments, such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists and progestins. However, since symptoms usually recur once treatment is stopped, this is not the preferred long-term treatment option.[2]","Uterine polyp removal, called a polypectomy, which is carried out using a hysteroscopy, is the standard procedure. The doctor uses a camera attached to a long, thin tube to examine the interior of the uterus, locate the polyp and then remove it with an integrated wire loop or blade. It is typically screened for cancer.[3]","The removal of small endometrial polyps using hysteroscopy can sometimes be done as an outpatient procedure at a doctor’s office, but removing large polyps may require a hospital stay. Many people are able to return to normal activities within the next few days. Side-effects of uterine polyp removal may include light spotting.[3]",Preventing endometrial polyp recurrence,"In most cases, endometrial polyps do not recur after they have been removed by polypectomy.[1] If they do recur, a repeat polypectomy procedure may be recommended.","If a person is concerned, an intrauterine device (IUD) can be inserted into the uterus to help prevent a recurrence of uterine polyps. This contraceptive may be a good choice for those who hope to maintain their fertility.[1]","Endomyometrial resection (EMR) – the surgical removal of around 5 mm of the uterine lining and some underlying muscle tissue – is another option, though this is a complex procedure and may not be appropriate for everyone. It is typically only recommended for people who do not wish to have children.[7]",Endometrial/uterine polyps and pregnancy,"It is thought that endometrial polyps may have a negative impact on a person’s fertility, but further research is needed in this field. Many doctors recommend removing polyps if the person is undergoing evaluation for infertility or has a history of miscarriage.[3] Nevertheless, studies do not suggest that endometrial polyps are associated with miscarriage.[8][4]","If younger people who may wish to have children undergo polypectomy (surgery to remove the polyps), it must be ensured that the deep lining of the uterus is not damaged.[1]",Uterine polyps FAQs,"Q: Are uterine polyps related to cancer?
A: Roughly 95 percent of the time, endometrial polyps are benign, meaning they are noncancerous. In about five percent of cases they are linked to cancer. If uterine polyps can develop into cancer, they are called precancerous. Among people with endometrial polyps, those presenting with bleeding and those older than 50 are more likely to have cancerous endometrial polyps.[3][9]","Q: How are endometrial polyps different from uterine fibroids (leiomyoma)?
A: Endometrial polyps are formed from the lining of the uterus and therefore only occur within the uterine cavity. Fibroids come from the uterine musculature and may arise on any part of the uterus interior, exterior or the uterine wall. Uterine polyps have roughly a 5 percent chance of being related to cancer (malignant), while fibroids have less than a 1 percent likelihood of malignancy.[4][10]"

Although there is no cure for endometriosis, treatments are usually very helpful in reducing symptoms.",Risks,"Endometriosis is a condition where the lining of the womb (the endometrium) grows in places which are not the uterus (womb). This acts like normal tissue, and may bleed during the menstrual period, causing the symptoms of this condition. The causes of endometriosis are still not well understood, but it is probable that several factors combine to cause this to happen. It is most common in women aged between 25 and 35, and rarely affects postmenopausal women. People who have a family member with endometriosis are more likely to also have endometriosis.",Symptoms,"Symptoms occur during the menstrual period, when the patches of abnormal tissue begin to bleed. The typical symptoms are very painful periods and heavy or irregular menstrual bleeding. People with endometriosis also have pain in the abdomen or lower back, pain when urinating or opening the bowels, pain during sexual intercourse, bloating, nausea and vomiting.",Diagnosis,"The diagnosis is usually made by an experienced doctor or gynecologist based on the symptoms and gynecological examination. Often a scan of the reproductive organs (the ovaries and the womb) is done to look for other causes. The best test for confirming the diagnosis is a surgical procedure called laparoscopy (keyhole surgery), during which patches of the womb lining can be seen on the abdominal organs.",Treatment,"There is no cure for endometriosis, so treatment involves controlling the symptoms. Simple pain medication, such as paracetamol, may help with period pain. Other treatments include hormone medications, which help to stabilize hormone levels and reduce the amount of menstrual bleeding, or medications that stop menstruation from occurring. These treatments reduce the symptoms and slow the growth of the abnormal tissue.

,,,,,,,,,,What is an enlarged prostate?
,,,,,,,,,,What is an enlarged prostate?,"The prostate is a small gland, usually about the size of a walnut, that is situated just below the bladder and above the penis.[1] The urethra passes through the prostate, which produces fluid that is mixed with sperm to create semen. When the prostate enlarges, it places pressure on the bladder and the urethra, which can cause urinary problems.",The prostate is made up of four zones:[2],"
Peripheral zone. The area most easily felt during the standard digital rectal exam and the zone from which prostate cancer tends to develop.
Transition zone. This surrounds the part of the urethra that passes through the prostate. It enlarges as men age, causing benign prostatic hyperplasia and consequent urinary symptoms.
Central zone
Anterior fibromuscular stroma
",The prostate can become enlarged for a variety of reasons. The most common are:[3],"
Prostatitis. Inflammation of the prostate that can occur in men of any age. There are several types of prostatitis, including infectious acute or chronic bacterial prostatitis, nonbacterial prostatitis, also known as chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS), and asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis in which an affected person will not show any symptoms.
Benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH). Benign prostate hyperlasia is a benign, non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate, usually found in men older than 50 years of age. ‘Hyperplasia’ means that the number of cells increases.
Prostate cancer. Cancer of the prostate, mostly originating in the peripheral zone. Prostate cancer can spread to other areas of the body.
",Symptoms of an enlarged prostate,"Because the prostate is positioned so close to the bladder, penis and rectum, most disorders which cause enlargement of the prostate share several basic symptoms. These include:[1][3][4][5][6]","
An urgent, at times uncontrollable, need to urinate, which may lead to incontinence if the person can’t make it to the bathroom in time
Trouble urinating
Frequent urination
Urinary hesitancy, i.e. slow start till urine streams out
Weak flow of urine
Frequent need to urinate at night, known as nocturia
Intermittent flow, i.e. stopping and starting
Leaking or dribbling urine
","Good to know: In severe cases of an enlarged prostate, whatever the cause, urinary retention (being unable to completely empty the bladder) may also occur.","In addition, prostatitis may also have some or all of the following symptoms:[7]","
Hematuria (blood in the urine) or blood in semen
Pain in the penis and testicles
Burning or painful sensation during urination
Painful or difficult ejaculation

Bacterial prostatitis
Acute bacterial prostatitis
Nonbacterial prostatitis, also known as chronic pelvic pain syndrome
Asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis
","Bacterial prostatitis, the most common type of prostatitis, can affect all adult men and sometimes accompanies recurring urinary tract infections.[9] It can occur when bacteria from the bowel transfer to the skin, to the urethra and then up into the urinary tract. Another cause is urinary retention, caused by an enlarged prostate, bladder or kidney stones, causing a urinary tract infection that then spreads to the prostate.","Factors that put individuals at risk of prostatitis, other than UTIs, include prostate surgery or any complications of prostate surgery, catheterisation (using a thin, flexible tube called a catheter to drain urine from the bladder, e.g. when healing after surgery), and infections spreading from other parts of the body. For prostatitis to be considered chronic, symptoms have to recur for at least three months. Recurrence is possible because the prostate can harbor infection. Symptoms can come and go. Chronic prostatitis tends not to cause fevers.","Acute prostatitis is caused by infection and manifests with chills, fever and muscle pain, in addition to the multitude of urinary symptoms mentioned above, often along with cloudy-appearing urine. It often causes intense/severe abdominal and/or pelvic pain. It is relatively rare compared to chronic prostatitis, but must be treated promptly. Complications can include developing a prostate abscess and also urinary retention, where the patient is unable to pass urine due to pain, and which requires catheterisation. A prostate abscess requires surgical intervention.[8]","Nonbacterial prostatitis or chronic pelvic pain syndrome can cause persistent discomfort and/or pain in the lower pelvic region, mainly around the anus and the base of the penis. The causes of CPPS are not well understood and may involve autoimmune responses, nerve problems, inflammation, or another, yet unidentified cause.","In asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis, there are no symptoms. The condition is usually diagnosed in the course of a prostate examination for other conditions or as part of a urologic routine check-up. It can cause elevated PSA-values - this is an enzyme produced by the prostate, often looked at during routine urologic check-ups of men over 50 and which can be detected in the blood.","Prostatitis is not a sexually-transmitted infection, although it can be caused by one.

By the time men turn 50 or older, an average of 40 percent have BPH to some degree. In BPH, the transition zone of the prostate enlarges, constricting the urethra, hindering, in some cases, the bladder’s ability to empty by throttling the flow of urine, which would normally move through the urethra and out of the bladder.","Benign prostatic hyperplasia is not cancer, but it can affect a person’s quality of life due to the urinary problems it causes, especially the increased need to urinate at night, which disrupts sleep.","If left untreated, BPH can cause complications such as kidney damage, urinary retention (the bladder not fully emptying anymore), bladder or kidney stones and urinary tract infections (UTIs), all due to disrupted urination. As it is largely an age-related disorder, BPH can worsen as it progresses if left unaddressed.",Read more about Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia »,Prostate cancer,"This is the second most common kind of cancer affecting men, after skin cancer.

A digital rectal exam. A physician or nurse will insert a gloved finger into the patient’s rectum to digitally examine the prostate for swelling and/or enlargement.
Swab tests for urethral discharge or urine. To determine underlying conditions such as STIs/STDs (sexually transmitted infections/diseases) and urinary tract infections. A swab of discharge or urine is taken and sent to a medical laboratory for culturing, so that any microorganisms are identified.
Urinalysis. A urine sample is sent to a medical laboratory for analysis and may be tested for urea nitrogen or creatinine, among other things.
Blood tests. A sample of blood is sent to a medical laboratory for analysis, which may include tests for creatinine or blood urea nitrogen, as well as antibodies and infectious agents.
Prostate-specific antigen test. A blood sample is sent to a medical laboratory to be tested for prostate-specific antigen (PSA), an enzyme produced by cells in the prostate. A change in PSA levels can indicate that there is a problem with the prostate.
","If patients are referred to a urologist, they may have further tests, including:","
Ultrasounds to check the kidneys, the amount of urine left in bladder and the prostate itself.
Urine flow studies, which involve urinating into a specialised device that measures the speed/rate of urine flow. A flow that is slower than normal may indicate an enlarged prostate.
A cystoscopy, in which a tiny camera is threaded up the urethra at the end of the very thin, flexible tube. This can pick up damage, inflammation or changes in the bladder and is usually done if there are symptoms such as blood in the urine, painful urination, or a urinary tract infection.
Bladder pressure (urodynamic) tests, in which tube sensors are placed in the bladder and sometimes also the rectum to measure pressure in the urethra, bladder and possibly rectum. An enlarged prostate can cause pressure in any of those places to increase, because it presses on the bladder and rectum.
The International Prostate Symptom Score, a questionnaire formulated to determine the severity and duration of prostate symptoms.
","Before referring the patient for tests, the physician may also ask questions in order to determine the possible causes of the discomfort, their severity, and their duration. Such questions may cover:","
Medications used, prescribed and over-the-counter medication
Other medical conditions, such as diabetes

Prostatectomy. The surgical removal of all or part of the prostate gland, which can be done as open surgery or laparoscopically (keyhole surgery). There are several different types of prostatectomy.
External beam radiotherapy. This involves x-ray beams, which are focused on the prostate to destroy cancer cells. This is a non-surgical option.
Permanent seed brachytherapy. This involves implanting small radioactive pellets into the prostate gland to destroy cancer cells.
Hormone therapy. This may be used instead of radiation therapy or if the cancer has spread too far to be susceptible to prostatectomy or radiation treatment; it involves orchiectomy (surgical castration) and/or various treatments to lower androgen levels (chemical castration).[19]
Cryotherapy. This is an option for cases where the cancer is still within the prostate or is locally advanced. It is non-invasive and involves the insertion of cryotherapy needles into the prostate, through which a certain gas is then passed in order to freeze the tissue and thereby also ideally killing the cancer cells.[20]
Focused ultrasound therapy. This is a non-invasive method of treating prostate cancer using focused beams of ultrasound energy to heat and destroy cancer locations in the prostate.[21]
",Enlarged prostate FAQs,"Q: Can an enlarged prostate affect my sexual function?
A: Whether or not an enlarged prostate affects sexual function depends on the underlying cause.","Prostatitis can cause erectile dysfunction because of pain.[22] It can also result in painful ejaculation, which can lead to problems with sexual pleasure and indirectly cause problems with sexual function.[23] This is likely to be temporary, and matters will improve along with the condition.","Benign prostatic hyperplasia itself does not cause erectile dysfunction, but some treatments for it, for example the drug finasteride, can. However, there are other drugs available, such as terazosin, tamsulosin and doxazosin, that are less likely to cause this side effect. Likewise, Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) can cause erectile dysfunction in some men.","Prostate cancer can cause problems such as erectile dysfunction, and if there is a sudden onset of such problems where no problems have existed before, a physician should be consulted. Some treatments for prostate cancer can affect sexual performance, e.g. by causing erectile dysfunction, due to the side-effects of hormone therapy, damage to erectile tissue resulting from radiation or brachytherapy or severed nerves and muscles after prostate surgery.","Q: Can an enlarged prostate affect my fertility?
A: Prostate problems, such as those resulting from pain and prostate cancer treatments, can lead to problems with getting and maintaining an erection and with ejaculation, which then affects successful conception.","However, any very enlarged prostate may also cause problems with sperm transport. If the prostate is enlarged, it can press on the ejaculatory ducts and prevent the adequate formulation of semen.[24]","Treatments for prostate cancer, especially radiation treatment and hormone treatment, can affect male fertility, owing to their effects on sperm production. Prostatectomy, when it involves the removal of the entire prostate and seminal vesicles, can render men unable to ejaculate. Radiation treatment causes a decline in sperm production and/or sperm quality, and the same is true of many chemotherapy treatments.","Inflammation of the prostate (prostatitis) can affect sperm motility, i.e. the way sperms move around, and fertility problems might result. Inflammation of the prostate can also cause bladder problems that lead to retrograde ejaculation, which is when semen enters the bladder rather than leaving the body.[25]"

In most cases, erectile dysfunction can be successfully managed, with treatment options depending on the root cause of the disorder.[1]",Erectile dysfunction symptoms,The symptoms of erectile dysfunction are:,"
An inability to get an erection
An inability to maintain an erection during sexual activity
","These symptoms may come and go over time or be situational, for example, not present during masturbation but present with a partner. If symptoms occur regularly or semi-regularly, visiting a doctor is advised.[2]",Erectile dysfunction causes,Erectile dysfunction can be caused by a variety of physical and psychological factors.[3],Physical causes,"Most cases of erectile dysfunction are caused by physical factors, which include:","
The most common cause for erectile dysfunction is reduced blood flow to the penis. This happens as a result of a narrowing of the arteries in the penis, with ageing, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and smoking making this more likely.
Excessive intake of alcohol or drugs can impair the ability to get or maintain an erection.
Diabetes, which can affect blood vessels and nerves, is another common cause of erectile dysfunction.
Conditions, such as Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis and stroke, can make erectile dysfunction more likely.
In some cases, erectile dysfunction can occur as a side-effect of medications, such as antidepressants, beta blockers and some diuretics.
A lack of certain hormones, particularly testosterone, can lead to erectile dysfunction, though this is uncommon.
Injury to the nerves in the penis as a result of surgery to nearby areas or spinal injury, for example, can lead to erectile dysfunction.
","If the causes of erectile dysfunction are physical in origin, the condition is more likely to appear gradually, with the problem occurring intermittently before getting more frequent. An individual’s sex drive is unlikely to be affected, unless the root cause is hormonal in nature.",Psychological causes,"A range of mental health issues can lead to the development of erectile dysfunction, including:","
Depression
Stress/Pressure
Anxiety
Relationship issues
","Purely psychological causes for erectile dysfunction are rare, limited to approximately 10 percent of cases.[4]","Psychological causes typically result in the sudden onset of the condition, as opposed to the gradual development caused by physical factors. When an individual is able to sometimes get and maintain a healthy erection (for example, when masturbating or in the morning) it may be a sign that their erectile dysfunction is psychological in origin.",Diagnosing erectile dysfunction,"The first stage in diagnosing erectile dysfunction is visiting a doctor, who will typically begin with questions regarding:[5]","
The symptoms experienced
The length of time symptoms have been present
General physical and mental health
Levels of alcohol and drug intake
Whether any other medication is also being taken
",It may also be necessary for an individual to answer questions about their sex life. These may include:,"
Details of current and past sexual relationships
Information about sexual orientation
Whether the dysfunction occurs all the time, intermittently or only in certain situations
Whether ejaculation is possible
Libido (levels of sexual desire)
","As narrowed blood vessels are the most common cause of erectile dysfunction, a doctor will usually examine an individual’s cardiovascular condition as part of the diagnosis. This may involve testing for high blood pressure, checking for heart irregularities, as well as evaluating an individual’s weight or overall level of health.",Blood tests may also be ordered to check for underlying medical conditions that may be causing the condition.,Erectile dysfunction treatment,"In most cases, doctors will be able to suggest and prescribe treatment options.

Esophageal cancer doesn’t usually cause any symptoms in the early stages. However, difficulty swallowing food, a heartburn, vomiting up blood, cough, and an undesired weight loss are some of the main symptoms when the tumor gets bigger. A history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), smoking and excessive alcohol intake increases the risk of esophageal cancer. Treatment usually involves surgery as well as radiotherapy or medication (chemotherapy).",Risks,"Cancer occurs when a group of abnormal cells grows uncontrollable. These cells tend to destroy the normal cells around them, and can spread into other parts of the body. Males are more commonly affected than females. This condition is most common in adults older than 60. People with long-standing gastroesophageal reflux disease may be at increased risk of developing this condition. Other factors which increase the likelihood of developing  esophageal cancer include drinking alcohol, smoking and being obese. People who both smoke and drink heavily are at even higher risk of developing this condition.",Symptoms,"Symptoms of esophageal cancer include difficulty swallowing (some people feel food sticking in their chest), regurgitating undigested food, reflux, heartburn, hoarseness or coughing when eating or drinking.

,,,,,,,,,,What is essential hypertension?
,,,,,,,,,,What is essential hypertension?,"Essential hypertension is a type of high blood pressure that has no clearly identifiable cause, but is thought to be linked to genetics, poor diet, lack of exercise and obesity. It is by far the most common form of high blood pressure, affecting the majority of those who experience hypertension. It is also known as primary hypertension.[1]","As the heart pumps blood through the circulatory system, blood presses against the artery walls. High blood pressure occurs when the walls of the arteries exert a stronger oppositional force, which requires the heart to work harder in order to move blood through the body. This results in an increase in the pressure of blood in the arteries.[2]","There are a variety of methods for managing essential hypertension, including lifestyle changes and medication. If left untreated, the condition can lead to serious complications, including heart attack and heart failure. People concerned that they may have essential hypertension can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.",Secondary hypertension,"Whereas essential hypertension is characterized by its lack of identifiable causes, secondary hypertension, another form of hypertension, is directly linked to a variety of vascular, endocrine (related to hormones), heart and kidney conditions. It is far less common than essential hypertension.[3]",Symptoms of essential hypertension,"In most cases, there will be no apparent symptoms of essential hypertension, and it will only be discovered during a regular medical examination. If essential hypertension is not diagnosed, the condition has the potential to worsen and create heart or kidney problems.","Sometimes, people with essential hypertension may experience headaches, dizziness and blurred vision, but these symptoms are unlikely to occur until blood pressure reaches very high levels.

A: Non-essential hypertension is an alternative name for secondary hypertension. Essential hypertension is characterized by a lack of clearly attributable causes, whereas secondary hypertension is directly linked to a variety of vascular, endocrine, heart and kidney conditions.","Q: Can pregnancy cause essential hypertension?
A: Essential hypertension is defined by its lack of a clearly attributable cause, meaning that pregnancy cannot be said to cause the condition. However, pregnancy can cause a form of hypertension known as gestational hypertension. By definition, this form of hypertension must occur after 20 weeks of pregnancy in a previously not hypertensive person and disappear after the delivery of the baby Longer lasting hypertension, detected either before pregnancy or before the 20th week of pregnancy, and which remains after delivery of the baby, is defined as chronic hypertension and can be a kind of essential hypertension.

This may affect the ability to hold objects and write. Some people have a tremor affecting the head, which causes quick head nodding or bobbing. The symptoms may be made worse by stress and caffeine.",Diagnosis,"The diagnosis is usually made based on the symptoms, the appearance of the tremor and examination of the neurological system. Sometimes a blood test to check liver function or a MRI scan of the head might be needed to exclude other causes of tremor.",Treatment,"Treatment is often not needed if the tremor is mild and does not cause any difficulty completing tasks. Some medications usually used to treat high blood pressure or seizures can help with tremor when used at low doses. If medication is not helpful, very severe cases can be treated with brain surgery. This is uncommon.",Other names for essential tremor,"

,,,,,,,,,,What is Fabry disease?
,,,,,,,,,,What is Fabry disease?,"Fabry disease is a rare genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A – also known as alpha-GAL. Alpha-GAL breaks down a fat called globotriaosylceramide (GL-3 or Gb3), which is normally produced inside healthy cells.","A lack of alpha-GAL causes this substance to build up inside the cell and disturb normal cell function, causing symptoms.[1] Fabry disease is one of a number of hereditary conditions known as lysosomal storage disorders, all of which cause problems with normal cell function.[2]","Fabry disease is very rare, and it is roughly estimated that it affects between 1 in 17,000 and 1 in 117,000 people. Due to the way in which it is passed on through genes, men are more likely to inherit the condition than women, with roughly 1 in every 20,000 to 40,000 men thought to have the condition.",Symptoms of Fabry disease,Signs of the condition typically manifest in early childhood and develop as the person ages. The symptoms of Fabry disease are varied and some are potentially life threatening.,"The following symptoms are most commonly observed in childhood and adolescence, though they may be experienced in adulthood too:[3]","
Pain and burning sensations, particularly in the hands and feet
Dark red spots on the skin, typically between the belly button and knees, sometimes referred to as angiokeratoma
Clouded vision
Tinnitus (ringing in the ears) and general hearing problems
Stomach, back, or kidney pain
Gastrointestinal problems including diarrhea, vomiting, and nausea
","The following, more serious, symptoms of Fabry’s disease are more likely to appear in adulthood:","
Osteoporosis
Heart attack or heart failure
Enlarged heart
Stroke
Kidney failure or serious renal complications
",Concerned that you or a loved one may have this condition? Start your free symptom assessment in the Ada app.,Causes of Fabry disease,"Fabry disease is caused by a genetic mutation. It is an X-linked disorder, meaning that the condition only affects the X-chromosome. As females have two X-chromosomes and males just one, males stand a far higher chance of inheriting the condition from a parent, because a second  X-chromosome offers some – but not total – protection against the mutation.[4]","The children of females with Fabry disease, both male and female, stand a 50 percent chance of inheriting the disorder. Female children of males with Fabry disease will always inherit the disorder, though they may not always display symptoms. Male children of males with the condition will not inherit Fabry disease.","The genetic defect leads to a lack of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A that in turn leads to a buildup of globotriaosylceramide, a type of fat that is normally broken down as part of healthy cell function. The severity of the disorder depends on how much alpha-galactosidase the body produces. In some, this can be none at all, while in others the enzyme is present but in insufficient quantities.[5]",Diagnosing Fabry disease,The early diagnosis of Fabry disease is important for beginning the management of the condition. This process may begin when a person displays some of the common symptoms and a doctor suspects the presence of the disorder.,"However, due to the rarity of Fabry disease, the initial signs of the disorder may not be recognized and the disorder left undiagnosed. If an individual or family member has observed similar symptoms in other family members and there is a suspicion of the condition, a doctor’s opinion should be sought.[6]","Laboratory testing can confirm the presence of Fabry disease. Enzyme assay, as the method is known, measures the volume of alpha-galactosidase A in the body. For males, this involves a blood test. If the blood shows a person has low levels of the enzyme, Fabry disease can be confirmed.","This test can also be carried out on females, but may not be as accurate. DNA testing is a far more accurate test for Fabry disease diagnosis in females.","Prenatal (before birth) testing for Fabry disease is also available, though this test will usually only be offered to parents with Fabry disease or those with a strong family history of the disorder.",Treatment of Fabry disease,"There is no cure for Fabry disease so treatment is centered on managing the symptoms of the disorder. This can be combined with enzyme replacement therapy, which has demonstrated some success in combating the enzyme deficiency and should be started as soon as a diagnosis is made.[7]",Enzyme replacement therapy,"Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is aimed at reversing the abnormalities in the cells of those with Fabry disease, thereby easing the symptoms of the condition.[8] Only in use since 2001, ERT is a relatively new treatment method for people with Fabry disease. Two medications are available for this treatment, Replagal and Fabrazyme, both of which are given through a drip into the veins. ERT has been shown to improve symptoms, as well as reducing the risk of kidney problems, stroke, and
hearing loss.[8]","Although enzyme-replacement therapy aims to treat the cause of Fabry disease, additional treatments might be needed to reduce symptoms and prevent complications.",Pain,"To combat pain, doctors will generally prescribe pain relief medication such as gabapentin, carbamazepine, phenytoin and opioids. The latter are generally reserved for particularly severe pain.",Skin rash,The skin rash associated with Fabry disease does not generally cause discomfort but can in some cases bleed. Cosmetic treatments such as laser therapy may be used to remove or lessen the rash.,Hearing loss,Individuals experiencing hearing loss can be fitted with a hearing aid.,Gastrointestinal problems,"Gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting and nausea are often managed with medications. Doctors may also advise people experiencing gastrointestinal problems to avoid any foods that trigger symptoms and to maintain a low-fat diet.",Fabry disease prognosis,The prognosis for Fabry disease depends on how early the condition is diagnosed and the severity of the symptoms. Early diagnosis and treatment can be effective in reducing the risk of complications developing.,"Those with severe symptoms or who develop severe complications can expect a poorer prognosis than those with milder symptoms. On average, males with the condition have a life expectancy of roughly 60 years and females roughly 75 years.[9]",Other names for Fabry disease,"

",Fabry disease FAQs,"Q: What is the life expectancy of people with Fabry disease?
A: Males with the Fabry disease have a life expectancy of roughly 60 years, while women have a life expectancy of roughly 75 years. Life expectancy, however, strongly depends on the severity of the condition and the age at which it is diagnosed.","Q: Can Fabry disease be detected by looking at the eyes?
A: Opticians and other eyecare professionals may be able to detect the presence of a cloudy buildup on the front of the eye, which can often be an early symptom of the condition. However, full confirmation of the diagnosis of Fabry disease is only possible with further testing.[10]","Q: What are the symptoms of Fabry disease in females? 
A: Females with Fabry disease can develop the same symptoms of Fabry disease as men, including pain and burning sensations, rashes and gastrointestinal problems.

,,,,,,,,,,What is failure to thrive?
,,,,,,,,,,What is failure to thrive?,"Failure to thrive (FTT) is defined as a delay in physical growth and weight gain in babies and children. As children mature, they are normally carefully monitored by doctors to ensure that they are growing at a healthy rate.","Percentiles are used to compare children of the same age and sex. If a child is said to be in the tenth percentile, for example, it means that out of 100 children, 90 children weigh more and 10 weigh less than or the same as the child of interest.","A diagnosis of failure to thrive is generally given to children who consistently register as being below the third to fifth percentiles, though this can differ from country to country. If a child dramatically falls from one percentile to another, from the 70th percentile to the 30th, for example, this may also be diagnosed as failure to thrive, even if their weight is not significantly low.[1]","The causes of failure to thrive are often complex, with medical disorders, as well as environmental and social factors, all playing a role. There is no specific treatment for the condition. Instead, the underlying causes will be considered and doctors and other medical professionals will outline a management plan based on this.","Although failure to thrive is most common in babies and children, it can also occur in elderly people, with symptoms including weight loss, frailty and loss of appetite. Management, as with children, typically involves addressing the underlying set of causes.",Causes of failure to thrive,"The basic cause of failure to thrive is a child not receiving, or being unable to retain and absorb, the necessary amount of calories and nutrients needed to support healthy growth. The reasons behind this failure are numerous, and more than one factor may play a role simultaneously. There are, however, two broad reasons why failure to thrive occurs: medical disorders and social/environmental factors.",Medical disorders,Medical disorders that may contribute to a failure to thrive include:[1][2],"
Problems chewing or swallowing caused by a cleft palate for example
Gastrointestinal problems
Brain or nervous system damage
Heart or lung problems
Genetic problems, such as Down syndrome
Hormone problems
Metabolic disorders, such as diabetes or cystic fibrosis
Blood disorders, such as anemia
Chronic infections, such as HIV
",Social and environmental factors,"Social and environmental factors as to why a child does not receive sufficient nutrition can include poverty, parental neglect or abuse, and parental mental health issues. Parents may also feed their child food lacking in sufficient nutrients or not be aware of how to properly prepare food and formula. Social and environmental factors are the most common cause of failure to thrive.[1]",Symptoms of failure to thrive,"The symptoms experienced as a result of failure to thrive depend on the severity and the underlying cause or causes of the condition. However, the key symptom of the condition is a child not developing and growing normally as compared to children of the same age and sex.",Symptoms of failure to thrive include:[2][3],"
Height, weight and head circumference which do not match with standard growth charts
Weight which consistently falls below the third to fifth percentile
Growth which has stopped or slowed significantly
Physical skills which do not develop as expected, such as standing and walking
Mental and social skills which do not develop as expected
Constipation
Excessive crying
Excessive sleepiness
Irritability
",Children may not experience all the possible symptoms of failure to thrive.,Failure to thrive diagnosis,"Diagnosis is usually made by a child health nurse or pediatrician following routine check-ups, during which weight, height and head circumference measurements are taken. The parents may also be asked about feeding routines and any issues that may be affecting the child’s access to proper nutrition, as well as about the family’s medical history. If there are signs that a child is failing to thrive, further tests may be undertaken to investigate and diagnose the underlying causes.",Failure to thrive treatment,"The treatment of failure to thrive depends on the underlying cause. If the condition is the result of an underlying medical disorder, treatment will be aimed at remedying or managing this condition.","If social and environmental factors are the cause, parental counseling and support may be recommended. The aim of this is to educate the parents about proper nutrition and to help find solutions to any financial and/or emotional issues that may be present. A meal plan may also be devised for the child to ensure that they receive the calories and nutrition needed.","In cases of severe failure to thrive, a child may be admitted to hospital where a team of doctors, pediatricians, nutritionists and social workers, among other professionals, will work together to formulate an appropriate treatment plan.",Prevention of failure to thrive,Regular checkups with a child health nurse can help to diagnose failure to thrive early on. Parenting classes or support groups are also a good way to develop ways and habits of improving a child’s nutrition.,Failure to thrive prognosis,"If failure to thrive is diagnosed early and appropriate steps are taken to remedy the condition then long-term health problems are unlikely. However, if this does not happen, especially if the child is in their first year of life – a period critical to development – they may experience long-term mental developmental difficulties affecting their verbal and mathematical skills, as well as their behavioral, social and emotional abilities.[1]",Failure to thrive in elderly adults,"Although failure to thrive is most commonly associated with infants and children, the condition can also be diagnosed in elderly people.[4] There is no widely agreed definition of FTT in elderly people, but it is generally described as a syndrome involving:[4]","
Weight loss
Loss of appetite
Poor nutrition
Frailty
Inactivity
Dehydration
Depression
Immune dysfunction
Low cholesterol
","Failure to thrive in elderly people is caused by a combination of factors, including the process of aging, as well as social circumstances, such as social isolation, lack of support and low socioeconomic status.","Treatment generally involves managing the underlying set of causes. If you or a loved one is displaying symptoms that may be linked to failure to thrive, try using the free Ada app for a symptom assessment.",Failure to thrive FAQs,"Q: Can failure to thrive be fatal?
A: Yes, in severe cases, when treatment is not received, failure to thrive can be fatal. This is true of failure to thrive in babies and children, as well as elderly people. Mortality as a result of the condition, however, is unlikely if prompt and appropriate treatment is received.","Q: What is the relationship between failure to thrive and autism?
A: The link between failure to thrive and autism has yet to be fully explored, but there does seem to be a relationship between childhood autism and feeding problems, a common feature of failure to thrive. Babies and infants with autism will not necessarily have FTT and vice versa, but severe feeding problems in very young children should alert doctors to the possibility of autism.[5]","Q: Can failure to thrive cause microcephaly?
A: Yes, failure to thrive can cause microcephaly or a smaller head circumference than normal. Microcephaly may be an indicator to doctors that a baby or child is experiencing failure to thrive. However, some babies or children with microcephaly may experience no other symptoms of failure to thrive.",Other names for failure to thrive,"

,,,,,,,,,,What is familial hypercholesterolemia?
,,,,,,,,,,What is familial hypercholesterolemia?,"Familial hypercholesterolemia is a hereditary condition, characterized by high total cholesterol levels and, specifically, elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein  – otherwise known as LDLc or “bad” cholesterol.[1] Cholesterol is a waxy fat that occurs naturally in the body and  is found in all the body's cells. HDL and LDL are fat proteins known as lipoproteins, which play a role in the transport of cholesterol.  When too much LDL cholesterol builds up, an individual is at risk of atherosclerosis and coronary heart conditions.[2]","As the condition is genetic, it cannot be fully cured. However, it can be managed through a combination of lifestyle changes and medication.",Causes of familial hypercholesterolemia,"Familial hypercholesterolemia is a genetic disorder caused by a mutated gene. This mutation disrupts the body’s ability to remove low-density lipoprotein from the blood as it normally would, resulting in the development of high levels of cholesterol.","The condition is autosomal dominant, meaning the gene mutation can be inherited if only one parent is a carrier. In these instances, the condition is known as heterozygous FH. In the rare case where both parents are carriers, a particularly severe variety of familial hypercholesterolemia known as homozygous FH will be passed on.","The condition is differentiated from standard hypercholesterolemia by its hereditary nature. Anyone can develop hypercholesterolemia – which is generally caused by unhealthy lifestyle choices – whereas only those with a family history of the condition can develop familial hypercholesterolemia. Standard high cholesterol generally develops in older individuals, whereas the genetic variety is present from birth and has a tendency to be more aggressive.[3]",Signs and symptoms of familial hypercholesterolemia,"In many cases, especially in younger people, there will be no obvious symptoms of familial hypercholesterolemia. However, if signs or symptoms do present themselves, they may include:[4]","
Xanthomas: Fatty deposits on the skin that typically appear on the hands, knees, buttocks, elbows and ankles.
Xanthelasmas: Deposits of cholesterol around the eyelids.
Arcus senilis: A white-colored ring around the cornea
Arthralgia (joint pain)
Tendonitis (inflamed tendons)
History of unusual skin lesions
At least one parent with severe hypercholesterolemia
","The most significant consequence of familial hypercholesterolemia, however, is heart disease. In cases of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, signs of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, such as angina and heart attack, will appear in middle age if the condition is not treated. In cases of homozygous hypercholesterolemia, symptoms occur in childhood, and many people with this condition die before the age of 20. Heart disease can lead to potentially life-threatening complications such as heart attack.",Diagnosing familial hypercholesterolemia,"Diagnosing familial hypercholesterolemia will generally involve three stages: an examination of an individual’s medical history, a physical examination and blood tests.",Medical history,"As familial hypercholesterolemia is hereditary, doctors will first inquire about a person’s family medical history. This will particularly focus on the parents, who are the carriers of the disorder. In some cases, the genetic form of the condition may have been misdiagnosed as standard hypercholesterolemia or may not have been diagnosed at all, meaning that it is possible to be unknowingly at risk of developing the genetic form of the condition.",Physical examination,"Doctors will also carry out a full physical examination to help diagnose familial hypercholesterolemia. This will particularly focus on checking for fatty deposits on the skin of hands, ankles, knees, elbows et al. and around the eyes – one of the more common exterior symptoms of high cholesterol levels. The doctor will also conduct a thorough cardiovascular examination.",Blood tests,Blood tests will be ordered to confirm a diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia. Blood tests will check for an individual’s total cholesterol level (HDL and LDL cholesterol) as well as the specific amount of LDL cholesterol.,"Adults with the condition will normally have total cholesterol levels of around 300 milligrams per deciliter and over, whereas children will have levels of around 250 milligrams per deciliter and over. LDL cholesterol levels will typically be around 220 milligrams per deciliter and over in adults and around 170-200 milligrams per deciliter and over in children.[5]","However, the exact levels involved will differ according to whether the condition is heterozygous or homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. In heterozygous FH, LDLc levels are usually higher than 250mg/dL, around 290mg/dL to 300mg/dL, and increase with age. In people younger than 20 years of age, an LDLc level higher than 200mg/dL suggests heterozygous FH.","In homozygous FH, however, total cholesterol and LDLc levels higher than 600mg/dL are typical in both adults and children.","Genetic tests can also be used to determine the presence of the defective gene, and a test for fibroblasts (connective tissue cells) can allow doctors to see how the body is absorbing cholesterol.",Read more about Blood Test Results »,Familial hypercholesterolemia treatment,Treatment for familial hypercholesterolemia aims to  reduce the risk of heart disease or heart attack. It usually combines the use of:,"
Medication:Statins (medicines which help lower the level of LDL in the blood) are typically prescribed to treat familial hypercholesterolemia. They are generally effective, but may be necessary throughout an individual’s life. Another medication, ezetimibe, may also be prescribed alongside statins if statins alone are ineffective.[6] For patients with FH, particularly homozygous FH, treatment should ideally be managed by a lipid specialist.  I
Diet and lifestyle changes: Combating high cholesterol levels may also involve making healthy lifestyle choices, such as avoiding tobacco products, excessive amounts of alcohol and remaining physically active. Diet changes may also be necessary. This will focus on avoiding saturated fats present in foods, such as dairy products, meat and pastry.[7] A vegetarian or even vegan lifestyle may be the best option for people with FH.
",Familial hypercholesterolemia prognosis,"The prognosis for familial hypercholesterolemia is dependent on how closely an individual follows the lifestyle and diet recommendations, as well as how well the body responds to the medication. These changes and medications can help significantly delay heart disease or heart attack.","Those with homozygous FH will generally receive a less positive prognosis, as will those who experience early complications, such as heart problems in childhood.[8]",Familial hypercholesterolemia FAQs,"Q: What is the life expectancy for those with familial hypercholesterolemia?
A: Without treatment, the life expectancy of those with familial hypercholesterolemia can be reduced by approximately 15-30 years. However, in people with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, the life expectancy may only be 20 years or less. Treatment, however, can manage the condition and lead to a significantly improved prognosis.[9]","Q: Can familial hypercholesterolemia be treated without the use of statins?
A: Statins are normally the preferred medication for treating high cholesterol. However, if side effects occur, or statins are not an available option for various reasons, there are other medications which can be used instead. These include cholesterol absorption inhibitors, sequestrants and niacin or vitamin B-3. The choice of treatment route should always be decided based on the recommendations of a medical professional.[10]"

","Fibrosis refers to the thickening and scarring of tissue, leading to areas that feel rubbery, firm or hard to the touch.","Cysts develop when fluid builds up inside the breast glands and is encapsulated. These begin with microcysts, which are too small to feel and only visible under a microscope. If fluid continues to build up, larger macrocysts may form, which can be felt easily and may be up to one or two inches in diameter.[1]","Fibrocystic changes occur in women of childbearing age, usually subsiding with menopause. The tissue alters over the course of the menstrual cycle and also significantly during periods of pregnancy and breastfeeding. These changes are a reaction to the fluctuating levels of the hormones estrogen and progesterone in the body. Changes in hormone levels are also believed to increase the likelihood of developing fibrocystic breasts, often making the condition more noticeable just before the menstrual period.",Taking the contraceptive pill may reduce the likelihood of developing fibrocystic breasts. Taking hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) after the menopause can cause women to develop fibrocystic breasts.,Diagnosis,"Fibrocystic breasts will often be suspected by a doctor on the basis of the symptoms and a physical examination. If there is unusual nipple discharge and/or a mass found during breast examination, ultrasound or mammography scans may then be carried out to confirm diagnosis.","The foremost concern is not fibrocystic breast condition itself, which is not normally serious, but the possibility that it may mask breast cancer, which has similar symptoms.","In order to rule out a cancer diagnosis, a biopsy may be done, i.e. a test that removes tissue or sometimes fluid from an area.

,,,,,,,,,,What is fibromyalgia?
,,,,,,,,,,What is fibromyalgia?,"Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain syndrome characterized by widespread muscular pain and tenderness. Locations typically fluctuate among the muscles, joints and back. Other symptoms are abdominal pain, headache, generally feeling unwell, morning stiffness, and poor quality of sleep. There is yet no fully clarified cause of fibromyalgia, but it strongly shows a tendency to run in families. It tends to affect women between the ages of 20 and 50 years. The diagnosis of fibromyalgia is based on the pattern and duration of symptoms and excluding other possible causes for the symptoms. Exercise, pain medications and emotional support are the pillars of treatment. There is no specific cure for fibromyalgia. Some people learn to manage their symptoms and some people may have pain which does not respond well to treatment.",Risks,"The causes of fibromyalgia are largely unknown. There are several factors that may combine to trigger the symptoms of fibromyalgia. These include having a family member who also suffers from fibromyalgia, depression, disturbed sleep, stress, and suffering a muscular injury or emotional trauma. It most commonly occurs in women between the ages of 20 and 50 years.",Symptoms,"The main symptom of fibromyalgia is a deep burning pain or ache which occurs in muscles on both sides of the body and in multiple areas. Other symptoms may include feeling unusually tired, difficulty sleeping, difficulty concentrating and memory problems.",Diagnosis,"The diagnosis may be made based on the symptoms, the duration of pain and the physical examination. A diary of symptoms may help to make the diagnosis. A blood test may also help to confirm the diagnosis in some people, but a normal or negative result does not exclude fibromyalgia. However, to confirm the diagnosis, a doctor should exclude other possible causes of the symptoms. Blood and urine tests are often done with the aim of excluding other conditions.",Treatment,"Treatment of fibromyalgia can be difficult because the cause is not well understood. Physical therapy and exercise programs are very effective in reducing pain and muscle stiffness for people with fibromyalgia. Some people also find stress-relieving activities helpful. Simple pain relief, such as paracetamol, may provide some relief, as may using hot packs or massage. People who don't get relief through these methods should see a pain specialist, who may be able to recommend other medications. Many people with fibromyalgia find support groups or counseling helpful in coming to terms with the diagnosis and dealing with the long-term pain.",Other names for fibromyalgia,"

,,,,,,,,,,What is folate?
,,,,,,,,,,What is folate?,"Folate is also known as Vitamin B9. It is one of a group of important vitamins involved in cell metabolism. Folate plays a critical role in the synthesis of DNA, RNA and proteins. Deficiency can therefore cause impairment of cell division and an accumulation of possibly toxic metabolites, e.g. homocysteine. Along with Vitamin B12, folate is important for regulating the manufacture of red blood cells.[1]","The synthetic form of folate is folic acid, which converts to folate in the body. Because folic acid is more easily absorbed by the body, it is the form most commonly used in supplements and fortified foods.","Many plants, particularly green leafy vegetables, and animal products contain folate. Thus, most healthy people absorb sufficient folate from their diets to avoid deficiency, but in some cases the body may increase demand. If supplementation doesn’t occur, this may lead to deficiency.","Folate deficiency is most commonly found in pregnant and lactating women, people with chronic conditions of the gastrointestinal tract, people following restricted diets due to weight-loss regimes or medical conditions, people with alcohol dependence and people more than 65 years of age.[2]","Folate deficiency will not go away on its own. Treatment is required and may involve dietary changes and/or oral supplements and treatment of underlying causes, if any are present. If left untreated, folate deficiency may result in folate deficiency anemia, which can cause severe complications.[3]",Signs and symptoms of folate deficiency,Common symptoms of folate deficiency can include:[2][4],"
Tiredness, fatigue and lethargy
Muscle weakness
Neurological signs, such as a feeling of pins and needles, tingling, or burning, or peripheral neuropathy, i.e. a numbness in the extremities
Psychological problems, such as depression, confusion, memory problems, problems of judgement and understanding
Gastrointestinal signs, such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weight loss and diarrhea
Headache and dizziness
Pallor
Shortness of breath
","Headache, dizziness, pallor and shortness of breath are also symptoms of anemia. Anemia, particularly megaloblastic anemia, is often the first sign that there is an underlying folate deficiency, and doctors will usually test for folate and Vitamin B12 deficiencies when they encounter anemia.",Less common symptoms of folate deficiency are:[2],"
Fast heartbeat (tachycardia)
Fast breathing (tachypnoea)
Exfoliative dermatitis, a condition which makes the skin red and scaly
Heart murmur
Painful swallowing
A sore tongue (glossitis) and mouth ulcers
Petechiae
Angular stomatitis (fissures in the corners of the mouth)
","In children with congenital malabsorption disorders, which are rare, neurological problems might also be present.",Diagnosis of folate deficiency,"Diagnosis is based on evaluation of symptoms and blood tests. Although there is no official medical consensus of what level of folate in blood serum indicates a deficiency, most practitioners agree that a level of less than seven nanomols per liter (7nmol/L) is problematic. Below that level, the risk of megaloblastic anemia is much higher.[3]  If a blood test reveals anemia, this will lead to further evaluation of the possible causes, including analyzing serum folate levels. Elevated homocysteine levels can also indicate a folate deficiency and can therefore be part of the laboratory testing.","The process of diagnosing a folate deficiency involves the exclusion of other possible causes of the symptoms. In cases where anemia is suspected, other possible causes of anemia, for example iron deficiency, vitamin B12 deficiency, chronic disease and others, must be excluded.","Physicians will evaluate the affected person’s diet for signs of insufficient intake, such as might accompany vegan diets, poor diets, or “fad” diets. Often, people with this condition present with a history of alcohol intake which contributes to a poor diet. Other affected people may be pregnant or lactating. Certain drugs, such as anticonvulsants, can also cause this type of deficiency.",Concerned that you might have a folate deficiency? Consult Ada for a free symptom assessment.,Causes of folate deficiency,"Folate deficiency has a number of potential causes. Most healthy people absorb sufficient folate from their diets to avoid deficiency, but in some cases the body may increase demand, which, if supplementation doesn’t occur, may lead to deficiency. In other cases, the body may be unable to absorb enough folate, due to low intake or excessive excretion.",Causes of folate deficiency include:[1][2][3][5],"
Low dietary intake due to medically restricted diets such as those followed by people with phenylketonuria or due to fad diets concentrating on foods that do not contain enough folate. Infants who are fed unfortified goat’s milk will also experience folate deficiency, as folate is not naturally present in goat’s milk.
Malabsorption, which can be due to age, liver problems or gastrointestinal problems causing chronic diarrhoea, such as sprue, celiac disease or inflammatory bowel disease. Other causes of malabsorption are pancreatitis, bariatric surgery and extensive surgery involving the large or small intestine. Malabsorption is also a risk for people who use drugs that interfere with the absorption of folate, such as proton-pump inhibitors, some anticonvulsants such as carbamezapine, phenytoin, valproic acid, and phenobarbitol.[6]
Disorders such as leukaemia, carcinomas and lymphomas, which increase the body’s demand for folate and may consequently lead to deficiency if folic acid supplements aren’t taken.
Age, which causes changes in the gastrointestinal systems of people more than 65 years of age. These may lead to reduced absorption and reduced dietary intake. (See below.)
Alcohol-related damage to the liver, which affects the way in which folate is stored in the liver and increases the amount of folate excreted in urine. People with alcohol dependence may also have a nutritionally insufficient diet. (See below.)
Pregnancy and lactation, which raise the body’s demand for folate considerably due to the growth of new tissue in both mother and fetus. Sufficient folic acid supplementation is crucial for pregnant women, as a deficiency may cause birth defects. (See below.)
Smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke.[7]
Renal dialysis, which affects the amounts of homocysteine in the body and therefore increases the amount of folic acid needed.
",Risks for folate deficiency,"While folic acid is found in many food and fortified products, some groups of people are more likely to develop a deficiency than others. Pregnant women, people with alcohol use addictions and the elderly are at particular risk.[8]",Alcohol abuse and folate deficiency,"Alcoholism causes physical damage to the body, and one significant element of this is the development of nutritional deficiencies. This is the result of damage to the liver, which uses stored nutrients to process alcohol. Alcohol abuse causes the liver to run out of stored nutrients, causing the body to draw nutrients out of the bloodstream to make up the difference.[9] This can cause deficiencies of Vitamin A, calcium, Vitamin B12 and Vitamin B9, which is also called folic acid or folate.","High alcohol concentrations can also directly destroy B vitamins in the gastrointestinal tract.[8] The body’s ability to process nutrients is further compromised as alcohol damages the liver, pancreas and stomach. The ability of the small intestine to absorb nutrients such as folate is also reduced.[10]","Furthermore, some people with alcoholism do not eat balanced diets, leading to low nutrient intake. Folate is one of the most important nutrients affected by excessive alcohol use. Folate deficiency can contribute to the development of alcoholic liver disease.[10]",Pregnancy and folate deficiency,"Folic acid is vital during pregnancy, as it is required for the growth and development of the fetus.","In women, pregnancy increases the risk of folate-deficiency-related anemia because of the effect it has on the mother’s circulatory system. During pregnancy, the mother’s blood volume increases, meaning that plasma levels and red blood cell numbers increase. Folate is needed to produce red blood cells, so pregnant women experience an increased demand for folate.[11]","In fetuses, folate is crucial for the proper development of the neural tube. Folic acid also prevents oral clefts and congenital heart disease.[11]","Ideally, women who are planning to have a baby should begin to supplement with folic acid before they fall pregnant (see below).",Age and folate deficiency,"It is well-established that folic acid levels can have an affect on a person’s mood, social function and cognitive function, especially among older people.[12] Depression is also common in people with folic acid deficiency. Many elderly people have folic acid deficiencies, because of ageing, poor diets linked to reduced income or absorption problems caused by medication. Some older people also develop  an increased demand for folate, for unknown reasons.[12]","Supplementation with B9 for older people may be helpful, and some studies have found that increasing folic acid supplementation in people with low folate levels leads to notable improvements in mood, cognitive function and social functioning.","However, it is not advisable to begin taking folate supplements without consulting a physician. This is important because in elderly people with anemia, supplementing with B9 may cover the effects of B12 deficiencies.[13]  For more information on B12 deficiencies, see the FAQs below.  If you are concerned that you or a loved one may have a folate deficiency, you can do a free symptom assessment with Ada.",Complications of folate deficiency,There are several possible health consequences of having folate deficiency. These include:,Anemia and folate deficiency,"Megaloblasts are large, poorly-formed red blood cells that form in cases of anemia caused by, among others, folate or B12 deficiencies. Megaloblastic anemia is a result of folate deficiency as well as one of the most easily-identified symptoms: sometimes, a deficiency is only identified when anemia presents. If it results from folate deficiency, this anemia, is treated by taking oral or intravenous folate supplements.[14] For more information on folate-related anemia and B12-related anemia, see FAQs below.",Risks of folate deficiency during pregnancy,Folic acid is very important in the correct development of cells and is crucial for the correct development of fetuses. Pregnant women and women planning to become pregnant should increase their folic acid intake to 400 micrograms a day.,"Women should increase their intake to 5mg a day if they are or wish to become pregnant and are affected by the following factors:[15] If a women is affected by diabetes, celiac disease, a BMI of more than 30 or is treated with drugs that affect folate absorption, additional supplementation must be considered.","Folic acid deficiency in the mother can cause defects in the neural tube, which is the structure that eventually develops into the baby’s spinal cord. Neural tube defects (NTDs) can include spina bifida, caudal regressive (affecting the lowest part of the spine), and cleft palate. Extremely rare, but severe, complications of folic acid deficiency can include anencephaly and encephaloceles, which involve the baby’s skull and brain.[16]",Treatment of folate deficiency,"In most cases, folate deficiency is relatively easy to correct. In cases where a deficiency has set in due to poor diet or age, taking a folic acid supplement or modifying the diet is sufficient. However, if there is an underlying problem, like alcoholic changes to the liver or a drug interaction or condition causing malabsorption, specialised treatment will be required. The underlying causes of folate deficiency need to be addressed to prevent the problem recurring.","Folate deficiency is relatively easily treated in cases where the deficiency is not severe. However, where it has caused anemia, folic acid supplementation and/or correcting diet alone will not be enough. In women with megaloblastic anemia, vitamin B12 deficiency must be ruled out before any folic acid treatment can begin. If complications have occurred, or if there is an underlying condition or factor causing the folate deficiency, the affected person may have to be referred to one or more of the following kinds of doctor:[2]","
Gastroenterologist, a doctor specialising in diseases and disorders of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, colon and rectum, as well as the pancreas, gallbladder, bile ducts and liver
Dietitian, a certified expert on diet and nutrition
Hematologist, a doctor specialising in diseases and disorders of the blood
",Natural sources of folic acid,"Folate is readily available in many whole foods, such as:[15]","
Leafy green vegetables such spinach, kale, broccoli, cabbage, and brussels sprouts
Beetroot
Citrus fruits
Liver
Beans and legumes such as peas, pinto, cannellini, or garbanzo beans/chickpeas
","Good to know: Liver should be avoided by pregnant women, due to the high levels of Vitamin A it contains. Too much vitamin A can cause birth defects.",Supplementation with folate/folic acid,"In some countries, such as the United States, South Africa, Chile, Canada and Costa Rica, grain cereal products (bread, pasta and cereal) are fortified with folic acid.[17] This is a major factor in reducing the number of neural tube defects that occur, but it is still recommended that anyone who is at risk of a deficiency, such as pregnant women, should make sure to get 400 micrograms of folate a day. This is especially the case if the following risk factors are present:","
Celiac disease or other intestinal absorption disorders
Thalassemia or sickle cell anemia; hereditary red blood cell disorders
Clinical obesity, a BMI of 30 or more.
Family history of, or partner with a family history of, neural tube defects. In this case, folic acid acts as “insurance.”
Rapid cell turnover (hemolysis) occuring as a result of chronic hematological disorders[3]
",FAQs,"Q:How much folic acid should I take every day?
A: The daily need of folic acid differs between adults (200mcg) and people younger than 14 years of age (150-200mcg). It must be emphasized that men, children and women who are not likely to become pregnant obtain a sufficient amount of folate in a healthy diet, containing a wide variety of foods. Pregnant and lactating women need at least 400 micrograms a day and possibly as much as 800mcg. Pregnant and lactating women with diabetes, or a family history of neural tube defects, should consult a specialist for optimum supplementation during pregnancy.[18]","Q:How much folic acid is too much?
A: The safe upper limit for daily folate/folic acid intake is 1000 micrograms a day. Beyond this, there might be adverse effects.[19] Not much is known about the long-term adverse effects of exceeding the upper limit, if any.[20] It has been suggested that taking too much folic acid is particularly risky for elderly people, because taking large amounts of B9 can mask the symptoms of a Vitamin B12 deficiency.","Q: Can folic acid deficiency cause diarrhea?
A: Yes, it can. Folic acid deficiency can cause a range of gastrointestinal problems, including diarrhea, stomach pain, and indigestion. Folic acid deficiency can lead to weight loss because of causing lack of appetite.","Q:How does taking extra folate affect a Vitamin B12 deficiency?
A: Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause severe neurological damage. It can also cause megaloblastic anemia. Taking supplemental doses of Vitamin B9 does make it look like the B12 deficiency is being cured, because it can increase the number of red blood cells in the body, which improves the anemia. But it does not cure the deficiency, and the neurological damage caused by the B12 deficiency will continue. It is possible that taking extra Vitamin B9 in cases of Vitamin B12 deficiency can worsen the severity of the B12 deficiency, but this is not known for certain. It is best to consult a physician if there is any possibility of a B12 deficiency.[14]","Q: Is folate supplementation safe for people with cancer?
A: It is not known for certain whether supplementation with folic acid is safe for people with cancer. Some studies suggest that folic acid reduces the chance of developing cancer and accelerates the progression of certain types of cancer; other studies suggest the opposite.[12] It is best to consult specialist physicians and/or oncological caregivers before beginning supplementation.","Q: What sort of anemia results from a deficiency of Vitamin B12?
A: The type of anemia that results from a vitamin B12 deficiency is known as pernicious anemia, a type of megaloblastic anemia. Megaloblastic anemia can also be caused by a deficiency of folic acid. In B12-related anemia, low levels of B12 affect the body’s ability to make red blood cells, resulting in anemia.","Q: What causes B12-related anemia, also known as pernicious anemia?
A:  In some people, low B12 levels happen because they cannot absorb B12 from food due to a lack of a substance known as intrinsic factor in the stomach. Other causes of low B12 levels include infections, surgery, some medications or diet, all of which can affect the amount of B12 that the body can absorb.[21]","B12-related anemia can affect anybody, but is most prevalent among people with English, Irish, Scottish or Scandinavian heritage and people between the ages of 40 and 70. It is as likely to affect men as it is women. [22]",Causes of B12-related anemia include:[21],"
Celiac disease
Crohn’s disease
HIV infection
Some types of medication for diabetes or epilepsy
Antibiotics that affect the gut’s bioflora, as bacteria use the B12 before the host can absorb it
Surgical removal of part of the small intestine
Alcoholism
Tapeworm infection, as the parasite uses the B12 before the host can absorb it
A diet low in B12
","Strict vegetarians and vegans are at increased risk of developing B12-related anemia because of their diets. Foods that are rich in B12 are animal products such as beef, fish, eggs and dairy products.[21] B12 anemia can also affect the babies of breastfeeding women who are strict vegetarians or vegans. However, in certain countries, many cereals and grain products are enriched with B12.","Q: What are the symptoms of B12-related anemia?
A: Symptoms of B12-related anemia include:","
Weight loss and loss of appetite
Increased heart rate
A painful, smooth, red and slightly swollen tongue
Low-grade fever
Weakness
Clumsiness
Hearing loss or vision loss
Tingling in the extremities
Unsteady gait/walk
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as constipation, nausea, vomiting, flatulence or heartburn.
","If the affected person is experiencing severe abdominal pain, a doctor should be consulted as soon as possible, as this indicates a severe B12 deficiency.","In older people, a B12 deficiency may also cause","
Memory loss
Irritability
Personality changes
","If you are concerned that you or a loved one might have pernicious anemia/B12-related anemia, Ada is ready to start your symptom assessment.","Q: How does megaloblastic anemia differ from other anemias?
A: Anemia occurs when an individual has too few or deformed red blood cells (erythrocytes). For example, anemia can occur when an individual’s iron levels are too low, e.g. when they are undergoing chemotherapy, or when they have kidney disease.","Megaloblastic anemia is also known as Vitamin B12-related anemia, folate-related anemia, or macrocytic anemia. It occurs when the body produces short-lived, large, poorly-developed red blood cells.[15] These blood cells cannot move out of the bone marrow where they develop, due to their shape. As a result, there are too few red blood cells in the blood, leaving the affected person feeling weak and fatigued.","Other types of anemia are hemolytic anemia, a subtype of hemolytic anemia known as sickle-cell anemia, and aplastic anemia. Hemolytic anemia can be inherited, as in the case of thalassemia or glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. It can also be caused by autoimmune disorders, infections or leaky heart valves. It occurs when red blood cells break up in the blood vessels or the spleen.[23]  Sickle-cell anemia is hereditary and causes rigid red blood cells that do not readily flow through the blood vessels. Aplastic anemia occurs when the bone marrow stops making enough red blood cells, often when the body’s immune system attacks it.","For more information on anemia, see this resource on anemia.

,,,,,,,,,,What is a food allergy?
,,,,,,,,,,What is a food allergy?,"A food allergy is a condition in which the immune system reacts toward certain types of food. Symptoms often occur within minutes or hours after eating the food. The allergic reaction may cause itchiness, swelling of the tongue, vomiting, diarrhea and difficulty breathing. The most common causes of food allergies are eggs, fish, milk, peanuts and soy. Food allergies are most common in babies and children. Developing an allergy to a type of food which had been previously eaten is possible, though uncommon. Some people will grow out of their allergy as they age, especially allergies to eggs, soy and milk. People experiencing possible symptoms of a food allergy can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.",Risks,"Many people have food intolerance (such as lactose intolerance, celiac disease, etc), instead of true food allergy. Food allergy occurs when the immune system overreacts to a normally harmless substance. These substances are called allergens or triggers. Common causes of food allergy include eggs, milk, peanuts, soy, fish, shellfish, tree nuts (Brazil nuts, macadamia nuts, etc.) and wheat, among others. Food allergy symptoms are most commonly diagnosed in babies and children, but they can also develop later in life. People with other allergic conditions, or who have family members with allergic conditions, such as hay fever and eczema, often also have food allergies.",Symptoms,"The symptoms of an allergic reaction usually begin within 2 hours after eating. They may involve the skin, the gastrointestinal tract, the cardiovascular system and the respiratory tract. The symptoms include hives, hoarse voice, rashes, itching and swelling (of the mouth, lips, tongue, throat and eyes), difficulty swallowing, congested nose, shortness of breathing, abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting and even cardiovascular collapse.",People experiencing possible symptoms of a food allergy can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.,Diagnosis,"Diagnosis is usually made based on the symptoms and excluding the suspected cause from the diet, to see if symptoms improve. If the cause is unknown, or excluding the food doesn't clearly improve symptoms, other tests for allergy, such as skin prick tests and blood tests, may be helpful in diagnosing the trigger.",Treatment,Food allergies are generally treated by identifying and avoiding the triggering food. People with a mild reaction may find that antihistamine medications help to relieve itching. Severe allergic reactions require emergency treatment. These people may be prescribed an EpiPen/Jext which is used to deliver adrenaline in an emergency.,Prevention,"Getting a definite diagnosis of triggers may help to avoid these and reduce or completely stop symptoms. For some people, it is possible to undergo desensitization therapy, which means the body is slowly exposed to the trigger responsible for their allergy. This causes the immune system to slowly get used to the trigger, helping to reduce the severity of the allergic reaction in the future."

Starchy foods – such as bread, sweet or regular potatoes, pasta, rice, cereals, noodles, oats and legumes like lentils or beans – help to fill a person up without containing too many calories. These foods provide energy, as well as certain minerals, vitamins and fibre.","Good to know: Whole foods are rich in phytochemicals (important nutrients) and other minerals. For this reason, it is recommended that a person chooses whole foods over processed/refined options during pregnancy. Examples of healthy starchy food choices to make during pregnancy include:","
Potatoes instead of potato chips
Whole wheat bread instead of white bread
Whole wheat, naturally sweetened cereals, e.g. by the addition of dried fruits, instead of sugary breakfast cereals
",Protein,"Protein, contained in foods such as meat, eggs, fish, poultry, soy, seitan, nuts, beans and pulses (legumes), should be consumed every day during pregnancy.","When eating meat, it is important to ensure it is cooked all the way through to avoid food poisoning. Meat should be lean, and the skin should be removed from poultry. Eggs should be of good quality and cooked thoroughly. Raw or semi-raw eggs, such as contained in some desserts, or not properly boiled can potentially cause salmonella.","Although it is important to ensure that all meats are cooked all the way though, it is important for a pregnant person to choose options which have not been highly processed. Examples of healthy protein choices to make during pregnancy include:","
A baked chicken breast instead of chicken nuggets
Poached fish instead of breaded fish fingers
Lean beef mince bolognese instead of a fast-food burger
",Dairy,"Dairy, contained in foods such as cheese, milk and yoghurt, is a good source of calcium and other nutrients.","Low-sugar and, if consumed in higher quantities, low-fat versions of milk and yoghurt, should be chosen when possible, and cheese should always be pasteurized.",Fats,"Consuming an adequate quantity of fats during pregnancy is vital to the development of a healthy baby, but it is important to choose the sources of fat in one’s diet wisely, opting for fats from unprocessed food sources as much as possible, because these are generally more nourishing than fat found in processed foods. For example, they are more likely to provide a better omega-3 to omega -6 fatty acid-ratio.",Recommended sources of healthy fats to consume during pregnancy include:,"
Whole nuts
Butter, preferably from grass-fed cows
Olive oil
Unrefined nut butters, without added sugar or other highly refined oils
","Sources of unhealthy fat, which people are recommended to avoid consuming regularly or in large quantities during pregnancy, include:","
Ready-made cakes, pies and cookies, because they are likely to be sources of hydrogenated or trans fats, which are bad for a person’s heart health
Fast food, such as store bought pizza, deep fried french fries or deep fried chicken nuggets, which are also likely to contain hydrogenated or trans fats
Candy bars and sweets
","Good to know: Above all, remember that choosing food should not produce feelings of guilt or lead to totally restricting oneself. If eaten in sensibly small amounts, all of these foods can be part of a healthy diet. It is also possible to create healthier versions of all of these foods, e.g. oven-baked homemade pizza with fresh tomatoes, rocket leaves and olive oil as toppings, oven roasted fries instead of deep fried fries, oven baked chicken fingers, homemade cookies with whole grain flour, less sugar and nut butters, and homemade candy bars made by combining seeds, a nut butter and dried fruits.",Read more about Foods to Avoid During Pregnancy »,Preparing food during pregnancy,"Changes to the immune system during pregnancy make pregnant women more susceptible to food poisoning than usual. It is, therefore, important to prepare food safely and hygienically during pregnancy.[6]","Pregnant women, and those preparing food for pregnant women, should take the following precautions:","
Wash fruit, vegetables and salads thoroughly
Wash all surfaces and utensils used to prepare raw meat thoroughly before and after use
Store raw and ready-to-eat foods separately
Cook meat and poultry thoroughly, until juices run clear
Heat ready-meals, especially those containing poultry, thoroughly before eating
",Foods to eat during pregnancy FAQs,"Q: Is it possible for people who follow a vegetarian or vegan diet to have a healthy pregnancy?
A: Yes. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics pronounces plant-based diets healthy for all stages of a person’s lifestyle, including pregnancy and lactation. Just like non-vegetarians and vegans, people who follow a plant-based diet will need to ensure that their food choices during pregnancy include the right amounts of dairy, protein, starchy foods, fresh fruit and vegetables.","It is important that pregnant women ensure that their daily food intake contains adequate levels of vitamins and minerals. People who follow a vegan diet are considered to be more at risk for certain vitamin and mineral deficiencies than the general population, and supplements may be needed to ensure that the correct levels are reached.","Good to know: Consult with a physician in order to choose the best supplements to take during pregnancy, as this varies between people according to factors such as a person’s overall health and the rest of their food intake.",The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine provides the following example of a day’s recommended food intake for vegetarian and vegan people during pregnancy:,"
Grains, breads and cereals. Nine or more servings. Examples of single servings include a slice of bread, half a cup of cooked rice or pasta or one cup of ready-to-eat cereal.
Vegetables. Four or more servings, including one dark green vegetable per day.
Fruits: Four or more servings; this may include cooked, raw, juiced and dried fruit.
Legumes, soy products and non-dairy milks. Five or six servings, which may include fortified soy milk, cooked beans, tofu or tempeh or a meat analogue.
Nuts, seeds, wheat germ. One or two servings, including two tablespoons of nut butter, seeds or wheat germ.
","Q: Can I diet during pregnancy?
A: According to the National Institute for Healthcare and Excellence (NICE), pregnant women are not advised to diet during pregnancy, and it is recommended that they should talk to their doctor or midwife if they are concerned about their weight.[1]","Q: How much weight does a person typically gain during pregnancy?
A: Guidelines outlined by the US Institute of Medicine state that women of a normal weight (BMI 18.5-24.9) usually gain between 11 and 16 kg while pregnant. Women who are overweight (BMI 25-29.9) usually gain between 7 and 11.5 kg, while obese women (BMI 30+) may gain between 5 and 9 kg. Research suggests that women who gain weight within these ranges are less likely to experience complications during and after pregnancy than those who exceed them."

describe a group of symptoms affecting the gastrointestinal tract, including stomach pain or discomfort, nausea, bloating and belching.[1] The condition is diagnosed when no obvious cause can be found for the symptoms present, though a small percentage of cases are caused by infection with the germ Helicobacter pylori. [2]",It is the most common form of dyspepsia and results in no serious consequences.[3] The symptoms of the condition can often be long lasting but are manageable through a combination of lifestyle changes and medication.,Symptoms of functional dyspepsia (indigestion),"Indigestion is characterized by a group of symptoms affecting the gastrointestinal tract, including:[4]","
Pain or discomfort in the chest or upper abdomen, usually after eating, eating too quickly
or eating a heavy meal
Bloating of the stomach
Excessive belching
Heartburn
Feeling full quickly and easily
A feeling of extreme fullness after eating
Nausea
","Symptoms of indigestion will typically vary in severity from person to person and can often be vague and unpredictable. Individuals may not experience all of the dyspeptic symptoms, though most will experience more than one.[5] The Ada app can help you check your symptoms. Download the free app or find out more about how it works.",Causes of functional dyspepsia (indigestion),"Functional dyspepsia is indigestion with no clear cause (such as an ulcer, gastritis or acid reflux). The gastrointestinal tract of individuals who have been diagnosed with the disorder will appear healthy.","Despite this, there are certain triggers which may bring on or worsen the symptoms of the condition. They include:","
Smoking and alcohol[6]
Obesity
Stress and anxiety
Infection with the germ Helicobacter pylori (not all people with the condition will have Helicobacter pylori in their stomach, and many people with the Helicobacter pylori germ will experience no symptoms)
Impairment of the stomach muscles, leading to slowed emptying of the stomach into the duodenum (first segment of the small intestine)
Roughly one in three people with the disorder also experience irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The cause of IBS, however, is unknown, meaning that the possible link between IBS and indigestion has not yet been properly established
",Diagnosing functional dyspepsia (indigestion),"Diagnosing functional dyspepsia involves ruling out other conditions that may be causing
the dyspeptic symptoms. Tests to check for conditions such as stomach ulcers, stomach cancer and gallstones must first return negative before a diagnosis can be given. This will usually involve
undergoing a gastroscopy (endoscopy), a procedure in which a doctor will pass a small
telescopic camera through the mouth and into the gastrointestinal tract for examination.","If the digestive system appears normal (free of ulcers, for example), a diagnosis of functional dyspepsia can be given. Blood tests, as well as tests to check for the presence of Helicobacter pylori, may also be useful in diagnosing the disorder.[7]",Functional dyspepsia (indigestion) treatment,"Functional dyspepsia cannot be fully cured, but its symptoms can be successfully managed through
lifestyle changes, medication, or a combination of the two.",Lifestyle changes may include:[8],"
Reducing, managing or removing any causes of ongoing stress and anxiety
Avoiding food and drinks which make the symptoms worse (caffeinated drinks or fatty food, for example)
Eating small, frequent meals as opposed to fewer, larger meals
Losing weight if overweight
Cutting down or giving up alcohol and tobacco
","If lifestyle changes do not help to improve the symptoms, there are
also a variety of medicines that can be effective in treating the symptoms of the condition:","
Medication to reduce acid in the stomach: Common medications which work in this way
include antacids, proton pump inhibitors (such as omeprazole, lansoprazole and rabeprazole)
and histamine blockers (such as ranitidine).
Helicobacter pylori treatment: If a Helicobacter pylori infection is present, treating
this with antibiotics may help to improve the symptoms.
Pain medication: Some medications which are usually used to treat depression or pain
can be used at low doses to treat functional dyspepsia. These can be helpful even for people
who are not depressed.
",Functional dyspepsia (indigestion) FAQs,"Q: Can children be affected by functional dyspepsia?
A: Yes, pediatric functional dyspepsia is fairly common. In children, the symptoms are
the same as in adults, and can be treated in a similar way. However, some medications may
be unsuitable for use on children, making it important to discuss treatment methods for
children with a doctor or pharmacist. Around half of all children with functional dyspepsia
will begin to feel better within a few weeks. Some children, however, may have symptoms which
last for a number of months.[9]","Q: Can functional dyspepsia be cured?
A: There is no cure for functional dyspepsia. Most people manage their symptoms well
with lifestyle changes and medications. Treating Helicobacter pylori (if present in the
stomach) may significantly reduce the symptoms. The symptoms of the condition can be variable, and may eventually occur much less frequently or go away completely.","Q: Are there any further health implications to having functional dyspepsia?
A: Functional dyspepsia is not linked to serious illnesses such as stomach cancer.","Q: What is the prognosis for functional dyspepsia?
A: Functional dyspepsia is a persistent condition that is not associated with any serious
complications, such as stomach ulcers or stomach cancer. Most people find their symptoms will come and go over time, depending on factors such as stress, lifestyle changes or other triggers.
Most will also be able to manage their symptoms effectively, and some people may find that
the symptoms eventually go away completely.[10]","Q: When should I see a doctor?
A: Individuals experiencing one or more of the symptoms of functional dyspepsia should
see a doctor at their earliest convenience. Based on a physical examination, a doctor will
be able to make a diagnosis and offer treatment options.","People belonging to the following groups should pay particular attention to symptoms, which
may be an indication of a more serious condition:[11]","
People aged over 50
People with a family history of digestive malignancy
People who have previously had gastric surgery

","Bacterial gastroenteritis is a common cause of “traveler’s diarrhea”, a type of gastroenteritis that frequently affects travelers to developing countries. It is often the result of poor food hygiene in local restaurants.[7]","Some cases of gastroenteritis are not caused by the bacteria themselves, but by toxins that they release. The harmful byproducts of certain types of bacteria can contaminate food, causing food poisoning when ingested. These byproducts are called exotoxins, and usually cause symptoms within 12 hours of consumption. This type of gastroenteritis typically resolves within 36 hours.[6]",Read more about Bacterial Gastroenteritis »,Parasite-related gastroenteritis,Gastroenteritis can also be caused by infection with intestinal parasites.

You notice any blood in your vomit or stools
You have severe stomach pain
You have a high temperature that does not go down
You have persistent diarrhea
","In addition, if you are elderly, pregnant, have a chronic health condition like diabetes, or have a compromised immune system, it is also important to consult a doctor.[13]","Q: Should I be worried about gastroenteritis during pregnancy?
A: Pregnant women are just as susceptible to gastroenteritis as everyone else. Most cases of the illness will clear on their own without any complications, and can be treated with rest and rehydration. Medicines should be used with caution. A medical practitioner should be consulted before taking any antiemetics or other medication.[14] If the gastroenteritis does not clear, there is a fever, or there are indications of a more serious condition, medical advice should be sought without delay.","Q: Is there a vaccine against rotavirus or norovirus?
A: There exists a vaccine against rotavirus, the main virus that causes acute gastroenteritis, named Rotarix. It is recommended that children and other at risk groups be vaccinated against rotavirus as early as possible.[15] Although there are vaccines in development, there currently exists no widely available vaccine against norovirus, another of the leading causes of acute gastroenteritis.[16] Consult a doctor for further information regarding vaccines and other preventive measures against rotavirus and norovirus.","Q: Should I be worried about “traveler’s diarrhea”?
A: Traveler’s diarrhea – a type of diarrhea that develops during or shortly after travel abroad – is commonly caused by bacterial gastroenteritis. The main symptom is diarrhea (typically watery), though nausea, vomiting and abdominal pains may also occur. Most cases of traveler's diarrhea are relatively mild and can be managed without the need for medical advice. Dehydration is the main risk, meaning it is important to consume plenty of fluids and get plenty of rest.[17]",Medical advice should be sought in any of the following situations:,"
A fever is present
There is blood in the stool
There is difficulty replacing fluids because of frequent bouts of diarrhea or vomiting
Symptoms last for more than three or four days
Antibiotic medication has been taken but symptoms have not ceased within three days of treatment

","Q: Do I have gastroenteritis (stomach flu) or the flu?
A: Gastroenteritis and the flu are easily confused, especially as gastroenteritis is also termed the stomach flu. They are, however, distinct conditions with their own symptoms. For example, diarrhea and vomiting (the main symptoms of gastroenteritis) are only very rarely associated with the flu. Moreover, the coughing and congestion associated with the flu are not symptoms of gastroenteritis. If there is any doubt over which condition an individual is experiencing, a doctor’s opinion should be sought.[18]","Q: What is the difference between gastroenteritis, gastritis and enteritis?
A: Gastroenteritis, gastritis and enteritis are distinct but similar conditions of the gastrointestinal system. The key distinction between the three is the specific part of the gastrointestinal tract that they affect. Gastroenteritis affects the stomach and small intestine, gastritis affects only the stomach, while enteritis affects only the small intestine.[19][20]"

,,,,,,,,,,What is gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)?,"Gastroesophageal reflux disease (commonly known as GERD or GORD) is a condition in which stomach acid leaks backwards up the esophagus (the tube between mouth and stomach). It is a common condition, especially in people over the age of 40 and pregnant women. People who smoke and/or regularly drink alcohol, and those who are obese are also more likely to develop GERD.","Common symptoms include a burning pain in the chest (heartburn) and an acidic taste in the mouth. The symptoms of GERD can be managed through diet and lifestyle changes (for example, losing weight, quitting smoking and/or reducing alcohol intake) and by taking medications to reduce stomach acidity. Gastroesophageal reflux disease can be effectively managed and usually causes no long-term problems.",Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) vs. Gastroesophageal reflux,"It is important to recognise the difference between gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and gastroesophageal reflux, also known as acid reflux. Both conditions occur when the contents of the stomach back up into the esophagus, however, simple gastroesophageal reflux rarely causes symptoms or complications, whereas GERD does.[1]",Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms,"Heartburn is the most common symptom of GERD. It is usually experienced as a burning sensation in the center of the chest which may spread to the throat. Typically, heartburn is experienced following meals, though it may also be triggered by lying down or bending over and can, in some cases, occur at night.",Other symptoms of GERD include:[1][2],"
Stomach pain
Non-burning chest pain
Pain when swallowing and an acidic taste in the mouth.
Regurgitation of food
Bad breath
Nausea and/or vomiting
Coughing and wheezing

",The symptoms experienced and the severity of these symptoms may differ from person to person.,Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) causes,"The esophageal sphincter,  a circular band of muscle at the base of the esophagus, usually prevents acid from leaking. Gastroesophageal reflux disease occurs when the sphincter becomes weakened and does not function as it should. The exact reason why this occurs is not known.[3]","Most people will experience acid reflux at some point in their lives, but some people are more at risk of developing GERD. These people include:[2]","
People over the age of 40
Pregnant women
Overweight or obese people
People who smoke or drink alcohol regularly
People with hiatus hernia, a condition involving part of the stomach pushing through the diaphragm
",Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) diagnosis,"Tests are not usually necessary to confirm a diagnosis of GERD. A doctor will usually be able to identify the condition from a description of the symptoms being experienced. Tests, however, may be necessary if the symptoms are severe and/or other more serious conditions are suspected.",These tests may include:[1][3],"
A gastroscopy (endoscopy): Using a flexible telescopic tube, doctors are able to see inside the esophagus and identify any signs of inflammation or injury. This will typically be the first diagnostic test performed.
Esophageal manometry: A tube is swallowed which is able to measure the muscle contractions of the esophagus and detect whether the sphincter is functioning as it should. Typically only performed if a gastroscopy is unrevealing.
Acidity test: A test to check the acid levels in the esophagus may be ordered if a gastroscopy is unrevealing.
Other tests: Alternative diagnostic tests, such as a chest X-ray or heart tracings may also be ordered if the diagnosis is not clear.
",Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) complications,"The majority of people who experience GERD do not develop any complications, particularly if the condition is managed well. However, serious complications are possible. They include:[1][4][5]","
Ulcers: Burning stomach acid can cause esophageal ulcers. These ulcers may bleed, something which will not be outwardly detectable.
Stricture: If the esophagus becomes damaged, it can scar and narrow, potentially causing a blockage (stricture). This blockage can prevent food and medication from reaching the stomach. This should be treated as a medical emergency.
Barrett’s esophagus: A condition that occurs when the normal cells of the esophagus (squamous cells) are replaced by intestinal cells, usually as a result of damage to the lining of the esophagus. Barrett’s esophagus is a risk factor for esophageal cancer.
Esophageal cancer: Cancer as a complication of GERD is very rare. Difficulty swallowing is the most typical symptom of this type of cancer.
",Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) treatment,The treatment method used for gastroesophageal reflux disease will depend on the severity of the condition. Mild cases will usually be treated with lifestyle changes and over-the-counter medication.,Lifestyle changes include:[1],"
Losing weight
Avoiding reflux-inducing foods and drinks, such as caffeine, chocolate and alcohol
Quitting smoking
Avoiding late meals
","If medication is required, doctors will generally prescribe proton pump inhibitors. This type of medication is generally safe to use and causes few side-effects. If the condition responds well to the medication,  the affected person may only need to use them in the short-term, usually for around eight weeks. However, if symptoms are recurrent,  long-term use may be required. Antacids, such as H2-antagonists, may also be prescribed in some cases.",Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) prevention,"Losing weight, avoiding alcohol and quitting smoking can help to prevent gastroesophageal reflux disease.

Some people have worry or anxiety which overwhelms parts of their life, and these people often have an anxiety disorder. Generalized anxiety disorder is a common condition, and around one in twenty people will suffer from this condition during their lifetime. A combination of several factors combine to cause generalized anxiety disorder. These include chemical imbalances in the brain, stressful experiences during childhood and adolescence, other medical conditions, and drug and alcohol use. It is also thought that anxiety disorders run in families, as having a close relative with a mental health condition, especially anxiety, increases the risk of developing an anxiety disorder.

,,,,,,,,,,What is a generalized seizure?
,,,,,,,,,,What is a generalized seizure?,"A generalized seizure is a period of uncontrolled electrical activity in the brain. This may be due to a condition which causes recurrent seizures (epilepsy) but there are many other causes. Generalized seizures can affect people of all ages, but tend to occur more commonly in children. The most common symptoms are convulsions, a loss of consciousness, memory loss and confusion following the seizure. If a seizure last longer than 5 minutes, urgent treatment in the emergency department might be needed. Diagnosis is made based on the symptoms and seizure patterns in the electroencephalogram (EEG). The treatment depends on the cause. Anti-seizure medications are sometimes begun after a recurrent seizure, and usually work well to prevent further episodes.",Risks,"Generalized seizures occur when uncontrolled electrical activity in the brain causes a seizure which affects the whole body. This may be by causing the classic, jerking seizure movements, or a complete stop in activity, such as what occurs in absence seizures. There are many causes of seizures, but in many cases, the cause remains unknown or is part of a condition which causes recurrent seizures (epilepsy). Other causes include high fevers (in children), alcohol withdrawal, infections of the nervous system and very low blood sugar levels, among others. Epilepsy is often genetic and tends to run in families. Depending on the cause, generalized seizures can affect people of all ages, but are more common in children and young adults. In people who develop epilepsy, the first seizure is usually before the age of 25.",Symptoms,"A generalized seizure may produce a number of different symptoms. Many cause a sudden loss of awareness or consciousness, with a loss of memory, and sometimes, confusion following the seizure. A common form of generalized seizures produces widespread muscle cramping before convulsions begin, with sudden twisting and jerking movements of the limbs. During the convulsion, people may lose control of their bladder or bite their tongue. Another form causes a sudden, short-lived loss of muscular strength. The seizure symptoms usually last 1 to 2 minutes. After the seizure, people are often drowsy or confused, and may fall asleep. If there is an underlying cause for the seizure, there may be symptoms of this condition before the seizure occurs, such as a fever or confusion.",Diagnosis,"The diagnosis of a generalized seizure is often based on a description of the event. If the events are recurring, a video of the symptoms may be helpful in making the diagnosis. A test called an electroencephalogram (EEG) is done to examine the electrical activity in the brain and look for seizure patterns. During this test, a seizure may be provoked. Tests may be done to look for a cause of the seizure.",Treatment,"During the seizure, the affected person should be protected from injuries and put into recovery position. There is no reason to restrain the person or put anything into their mouth. If the seizure lasts longer than 5 min, call an ambulance. It is recommended to see a doctor following a first-ever seizure, regardless of how long it lasts. Medication to stop seizures is usually only started after a second seizure has occurred. If an underlying cause is found, this may require further medication or treatments.",Prevention,Careful management of blood sugar levels in people with diabetes may help to prevent some cases of this condition.

It is passed on through skin-to-skin contact, most commonly through oral, vaginal or anal intercourse.","Although the warts rarely cause any long-term harm, they are generally considered unsightly and may cause psychological distress. There is no cure for genital warts or HPV, meaning treatment options are limited to managing the physical impact.",Symptoms of genital warts,"Most people who contract HPV will not develop any visible symptoms. If genital warts do appear, it can sometimes be a significant amount of time – weeks or even months – after first contracting the infection.[2]","Genital warts generally form in clusters, though a single wart can also appear. They normally form on the outside of the body in the genital or anal area, typically on the vagina, labia majora, penile shaft or scrotum. They can also less commonly appear internally; inside the anus, the vagina, the opening of the urethra or on the cervix.","Genital warts usually take the form of small bumps of roughly two to three centimeters in diameter and are sometimes described as resembling miniature cauliflowers. They typically cause no pain and minimal discomfort, are red or skin-colored in appearance, and can be either soft or hard to touch.

This exam will typically include a Pap test (sometimes called a Pap smear).[5] A procedure usually used to test for cervical cancer, the Pap test screens the cervix for abnormal cells, which are a possible sign of HPV infection. If abnormal cells are found on the cervix, further tests will be carried out to screen for HPV infection, as well as the presence of cervical cancer.",Genital warts treatment,"There is no cure for genital warts – no way to remove HPV from the patient's system – meaning that treatment is focussed on removing the warts or preventing them from spreading. The direction that treatment will take depends on the amount of warts present, their location and their physical appearance.[6]","Some patients will choose to undergo no treatment for genital warts. This option is perfectly safe but will generally prolong the problem. If the patient does opt for treatment, there are a number of different options to explore:","
Application of antiviral gels or creams. These solutions are marketed in a number of different varieties but are generally applied by the patient themselves over the course of a number of days or weeks. Side-effects may include itching and mild scarring.
Cryotherapy (freezing). Liquid nitrogen is used to rapidly freeze the affected area, resulting in a mild burning sensation. This procedure is usually used for small warts around the penis or vulva.
Excision. The warts are surgically removed while the patient is under a local anesthetic. Typically used for small, hardened warts.
Electrosurgery. Generally used for large clusters of warts that have not responded to other treatments, this option involves cutting away the bulk of the warts, pressing a metal rod against the affected area and sending an electric current through it to burn away what remains.
Laser surgery. Generally used for large clusters of warts or those that are difficult to reach (inside the anus, for example). A specialist will use a laser to burn away the mass of warts while the patient is under regional or general anaesthetic.

Other joints in the foot
Fingers
Ankles
Wrists
Knees
Elbows
","Because urate crystals do not form as easily in warm areas, such as sites close to the centre of the body, it is unusual for gout to target more central parts of the body such as the hips, shoulders or spine.","This sensitivity to temperature leads to gout symptoms often occurring at night, when the body temperature generally lowers. Additionally, the fluid that has built up in the affected joint during the day will drain away while lying down, resulting in a more concentrated level of uric acid.[^6]",Less common symptoms of a gout attack can include:[^2][^7],"
An increased heart rate

Gout tends to affect more men than women and becomes more common with age.[^1],"Gout is caused by excess uric acid in the bloodstream, a condition also known as hyperuricemia.[^4] This excess uric acid can result in urate crystals forming in and around the joints, causing the joint to become inflamed, painful and red. Gout usually occurs in one joint at a time, most often the big toe.","Uric acid is produced naturally in the body as a by-product of breaking down purines, a type of chemical compound found in certain foods.[^8] Usually, the body passes out excess uric acid in the urine. However, if the kidneys cannot expel enough uric acid, it can build up and cause high levels of uric acid in the bloodstream, a state known as hyperuricemia.[^1] Although gout is a possible outcome of hyperuricemia, it is important to note that not all people with hyperuricemia will develop gout.[^2]",Risk factors,Gout is a complex disease and there are often a number of risk factors that contribute towards its development.,Genetics,"Most people who suffer from gout have kidneys that cannot eliminate the required amount of uric acid. The inability to expel enough uric acid from the kidneys is typically a genetic trait. Therefore, gout often runs in families and around one in five cases occur in people with a family history of gout.[^1]",Diet,"Purine-rich food and drink can increase uric acid levels in the blood and are a risk factor for gout, especially in people who already have problems with uric acid excretion.

This is because overweight bodies tend to produce more insulin, and insulin can inhibit the kidneys’ ability to expel uric acid.[^9]",Medications,"Certain medications may raise the levels of uric acid in the body. These include diuretics, also known as water pills, which work by decreasing the amount of fluid in your body and are often used to treat conditions such as high blood pressure.[^10] Aspirin and some chemotherapy medicines have also been shown to raise the body’s uric acid levels.[^1]",Other medical conditions,People with certain medical conditions may also be at greater risk of developing gout. These include: [^1][^2][^3][^4],"
Kidney disease or damage
High blood pressure, also known as hypertension
Diabetes
Underactive thyroid gland, also known as hypothyroidism
Congestive heart failure
Certain cancers and blood disorders including leukaemia, lymphoma and hemolytic anemia
Psoriasis
",Diagnosing gout,"Diagnosis of gout is typically based on a patient's medical history, symptoms and a physical examination. Further diagnostic measures taken by doctors may include:[^2][^11]","
Taking a sample of fluid from a swollen joint to be tested for urate crystals
Blood tests to monitor the amount of uric acid in the blood
Ultrasounds or X-rays of the joint to look for signs of damage as a result of gout
",Treatment of gout,Gout can often be successfully managed through medication and lifestyle changes. There are two main aims to treating gout:[^5],"
Treating the symptoms of the current gout attack
Ongoing treatment to reduce the likelihood of gout returning (see Prevention of gout below)
","To treat the immediate symptoms of gout, medication may be prescribed by doctors to reduce discomfort and swelling. Such medications include:[^1][^4][^12]","
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen or naproxen to help reduce swelling and pain in the joint. These are most effective when taken soon after symptoms begin
Colchicine, an anti-inflammatory drug. Colchicine is most effective when taken within the first 24 hours of the attack beginning
Corticosteroids such as prednisone also help to reduce inflammation and are often prescribed to people at risk of side-effects from other medications
","In addition to prescription drugs, there are a number of at-home treatments which may help alleviate the initial symptoms of gout:[^1][^5]","
Elevate the inflamed area to above the heart to help reduce swelling. The simplest way to do this is to lie down on a bed or sofa and raise the affected joint on a couple of cushions
Rest, and avoid vigorous movement as much as possible
Place ice against the inflamed joint for 20 minutes at a time to help reduce some of the swelling, heat and pain. Always wrap the ice in a clean towel first to avoid direct contact with the skin
During night time, placing a cage or cradle around the affected joint to reduce the weight of bed sheets may provide some pain relief
","Symptoms from a gout attack usually get better within three to 10 days. However, roughly two in every three people who experience an acute attack of gout will have another one within a year.[^1] Therefore, preventative measures are often recommended to minimise the likelihood of gout returning.",Preventing gout,There are many lifestyle changes that people who are vulnerable to gout can make to reduce the risk of developing the condition. Such changes may also be recommended by a doctor to people who have experienced gout before. Steps that can be taken to reduce the risk of developing gout include:[^1][^2][^3][^4],"
Maintaining a healthy diet and limiting the intake of purine-rich foods
Limiting alcohol intake
Losing weight, if necessary
Increasing exercise; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends adults undertake 150 minutes of moderate physical activity every week e.g. brisk walking, swimming or cycling
Keeping hydrated by drinking plenty of water. Adults should aim to drink between one and two liters of water every day. Avoid sodas and fruit juices, which can be high in purines and fructose
If already taking medication, consult with a doctor to determine if it can increase the risk of gout
","As well as lifestyle changes, a long-term medication may be prescribed by a doctor to help prevent future attacks of gout. Such medications include:[^1][^3][^4][^5]","
Allopurinol, which reduces the amount of uric acid in the blood. It is often prescribed to people who have already had multiple attacks of gout and can take a couple of months to become fully effective
Febuxostat also reduces the amount of uric acid in the body, however it has a number of side-effects and is mostly suggested to people who cannot take allopurinol
Uricosuric drugs such as probenecid, which increase the amount of uric acid the kidneys are able to pass out in the urine
",Complications of gout,"Although gout can be very painful, complications arising from the condition are uncommon. Some people never develop gout again. However, others with this condition experience recurrent flares which, if left untreated, can turn into chronic gout. Chronic gout can lead to various complications including:[^2][^13][^14][^15]","
The development of hard bumps under the skin, known as tophi. Tophi are deposits of urate crystals that build up over time in soft tissues, most often in the feet, hands, ankles, wrists and ears. At this stage of gout the condition is often referred to as chronic tophaceous gout. Over time tophi can damage the tissues around the joints, which can cause arthritis and other permanent joint problems
Kidney stones. Approximately 20 percent of people with gout also develop kidney stones due to urate crystals forming in the kidneys, which in turn can lead to kidney damage
Joint deformity due to progressive damage of the tissues around the joint
A chronic disorder known as osteoarthritis, resulting in persistent pain and stiffness to the joints
",Early diagnosis and intervention allows most people with gout to make a full recovery. Even people affected by chronic gout can receive treatment to lower the levels of uric acid in the body and resolve certain complications such as tophi and impaired joint function.[^16],Gout FAQs,"Q: Why does gout occur most often in the foot?
A: There are a number of factors that contribute to gout often developing in the foot, in particular the big toe. Firstly, gout is a condition that affects the joints in the body and the foot is home to multiple joints. Secondly, the urate crystals which cause gout form more readily in cool temperatures and the feet are significantly cooler than more central joints in the body such as the hips, shoulders or spine. Thirdly, gout is more likely to target an area that has previously been injured or stressed, making the foot especially susceptible.[^17]","Q: How long does gout last for?
A: An attack of gout usually lasts between three to 10 days. However, anyone who has experienced gout is at a higher risk of developing it again. If left untreated, gout can become a long-term or chronic condition with attacks happening more frequently and with higher intensity. Leaving gout untreated can also lead to further complications such as kidney stones, joint deformity, osteoarthritis and hard bumps forming under the skin known as tophi. Therefore if gout is suspected, a visit to the doctor is always recommended.","Q: What is the difference between primary and secondary gout?
A: Primary gout is the most common category of gout and is usually related to the combination of naturally-occurring risk factors such as genetics and diet. Secondary gout is when a specific cause for the condition can be identified, such as the existence of a medical condition, or taking medications which increase the levels of uric acid in the bloodstream.[^5]","Q: Are gout and pseudogout the same?
A: No. Although gout and pseudogout have some similar symptoms and treatments, they have entirely different causes and should be treated separately. Gout is caused by excess uric acid in the body, while pseudogout is caused by excess calcium pyrophosphate. This means the preventative measures that can be taken to reduce the risk of developing gout, such as a low-purine diet, are not applicable to pseudogout.[^18]","Q: Is there a link between diet and gout?
A: Yes. Gout is caused by high levels of uric acid in the bloodstream. Uric acid is produced in the body when breaking down a chemical called purine, which is found in certain foods.[^19] Examples of high purine foods are:","
Alcohol, especially beer
Some fish, seafood and shellfish
Some meats including organ meat and red meat
","A doctor may recommend changes to your diet to reduce the risk of gout attacks returning. However, while diet is a risk factor for gout, it is not the sole cause. A low-purine diet should not be considered a cure for gout and dietary alterations should always be discussed with a doctor.","[^1] Patient Info. “Gout.”. 24 January 2017. Accessed 26 September 2018.

,,,,,,,,,,What is hashimoto’s thyroiditis hypothyroidism?
,,,,,,,,,,What is hashimoto’s thyroiditis hypothyroidism?,"Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, also called Hashimoto’s disease or chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, is a condition in which the body’s immune system attacks the thyroid gland. It may lead to hypothyroidism. In this case, the thyroid gland, located in the front of the throat below the Adam’s apple, does not produce enough hormones for the body anymore. The thyroid hormones are important for the metabolism. This condition can affect anyone, but is more common in women than men, and is most commonly diagnosed between the ages of 30 and 50. Hypothyroidism caused by Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is treated by administering a replacement thyroid hormone.",Risks,"The thyroid gland sits at the front of the throat, and produces a hormone (thyroid hormone) which controls metabolism (cell activity). In Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, the immune system begins to mistakenly attack the thyroid gland. This causes damage to the thyroid, and less thyroid hormone is produced. This is called hypothyroidism. The exact cause for Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is not known, though it is probable that several interacting events occur to cause this condition. Some factors which seem to increase the chance of developing this condition include having a family member with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, cigarette smoking, some viral infections, exposure to radiation and stress. This condition is more common in women than men, and is most commonly diagnosed between the ages of 30 and 50.",Symptoms,"In the early stages, there may be no symptoms, or just a slowly enlarging thyroid lump (goiter). The front of the throat may be sore or tender. Other symptoms include tiredness, weight gain, pale and dry skin, constipation, sensitivity to cold weather, joint and muscle pain and difficulty concentrating. Women may experience difficulty falling pregnant and irregular menstrual periods.",Diagnosis,"The diagnosis is made based on the symptoms and appearance of the affected person, and a blood test that measures levels of thyroid hormones. A blood test is also done which checks for antibodies (proteins which fight infection) which are active against the thyroid gland and thyroid hormone. If a goiter (thyroid lump) is present, this might be scanned by ultrasound, and a sample (biopsy) may be taken to exclude other causes for the lump.",Treatment,"Treatment involves replacement of the thyroid hormone with medication. This is life-long treatment, as the thyroid gland does not recover. This treatment reverses the symptoms of the reduced thyroid function.",Other names for hashimotos thyroiditis hypothyroidism,"

,,,,,,,,,,What is hay fever?
,,,,,,,,,,What is hay fever?,"People affected by hay fever experience an allergic reaction to pollen
from plants. The type of allergic reaction involved in hay fever an allergic rhinitis reaction, which may involve a skin rash called hives, as well as coughing, sneezing and itchty, watery eyes. Allergic rhinitis is one of the atopic diseases; a set of genetically inherited conditions including asthma, atopic eczema and atopic dermatitis.","Plants produce more during the early spring and summer months. For this reason,
the allergic rhinitis that occurs in hay fever can also be described as seasonal rhinitis.
Both adults and children can suffer from hay fever and it is estimated to affect between
40 and 60 million people in the United States.[1]",Symptoms,"The allergic rhinitis reaction is triggered when certain allergens such as pollen, mold or house dust come into contact with the lining of the eyes, nose and throat. This causes symptoms such as:","
Coughing (as a result of the post nasal drip)
Hives (a rash on the skin)
Red, itchy, and watery eyes (allergic conjunctivitis
Runny or stuffy nose
Sneezing
Swelling around the eyes
","The symptoms of allergic rhinitis can be uncomfortable for the sufferer and may interfere
with daily life. As a result of their symptoms, people with hay fever can experience problems including:","
Trouble sleeping
Problems remembering things
Irritability
Decreased concentration
Increased risk of work-related injuries and vehicle accidents
","In addition to the symptoms listed above, people who suffer from both asthma and allergic
rhinitis are likely to experience asthmatic symptoms during an attack of hay fever. Most
commonly these include a tight feeling in the chest, wheezing and shortness of breath. If you think that you or a loved one may be affected by hay fever, you can get a free symptom assessment by downloading the Ada app.",Causes,"Sufferers of hay fever commonly experience symptoms during the summer months when the pollen count is at its highest. To reduce the negative impact of hay fever, it is necessary to identify the specific allergens which trigger the symptoms.",Particular plants which are known to cause hay fever symptoms on a widespread scale include:[2],"
Airborne mold (summer and autumn)
Grass pollen (spring and summer)
Pollen from trees (spring and summer)
Weed pollen  (spring, summer and autumn)
",Diagnosis,"To diagnose hay fever, a doctor will assess the symptoms.",Diagnostic tests which may be carried out include an intradermal test and/or a prick and scratch test. These tests involve giving the affected person small amounts of specific allergens to see if an allergic reaction takes place.,Intradermal test,"An intradermal test is the most accurate way to determine whether a person is suffering
from hay fever. Possible allergens (such as grass and weed pollen) are injected under the
skin. After 20 minutes, the site is monitored for an allergic reaction, which usually
involves the reddening of the skin and an itching sensation.",Prick or scratch test,"The prick or scratch test the most common type of skin test. It involves pricking or scratching
the skin before exposure to an allergen-containing solution. The results are known within
10 to 20 minutes.",Blood test,"In certain cases; for example, if there is a medical reason why intradermal or prick or scrach testing cannot be carried out, a blood test may be used to confirm the diagnosis of hay fever.","A blood test for hay fever is also known as an antibody test. It involves sending a sample of the affected person's blood to a laboratory, where it will be analysed for the presence of antibodies called immunoglobulin E (IgE). These are protiens which are produced by the immune system during an allergic reaction to pollen. In people who are having an allergic response to pollen, levels of IgE in the blood will be significantly higher than in those who are not, leading to a diagnosis of hay fever.",Read more about Blood Test Results »,Treatment,"A treatment plan for hay fever typically involves following precautions to avoid hay fever
triggers and taking medication as needed to manage the symptoms. For many people, one or
more short-term medications can be sufficient to manage the symptoms of hay fever. For
others, immunotherapy is a possible treatment option that can provide long-term relief.",Medications for temporary relief,"For many people affected by hay fever, short-term medications effectively treat the symptoms
of hay fever on a temporary basis. Alleviating the symptoms when they flare up is usually
sufficient for someone with hay fever to maintain a normal quality of life.","Antihistamines relieve the symptoms of an allergic reaction, such as itching, skin
irritation and watery eyes. They can be administered as needed as nasal spray, tablets or
eye drops.","Nasal corticosteroid medications are very effective at reducing the symptoms
caused by allergies. Used over time, they can help to desensitise the nasal passageway to
the allergens which cause hay fever.[3]",Immunotherapy (hyposensitization therapy),"If antihistamines and nasal corticosteroid medications do not enable a person to manage their
hay fever symptoms effectively, the doctor will prescribe a course of immunotherapy.","Immunotherapy is a long-term treatment option which serves to alter the body’s autoimmune response to allergens. When it is used to treat hay fever, a course of immunotherapy typically begins about three months before exposure to hay fever triggers is likely to occur and involves either a series of injections or the administration of sublingual allergy tablets.","Treatment with sublingual immunotherapy involves daily administration of the allergens, in
a liquid or tablet which is placed under the tongue. Treatment with injections is divided
into two stages. In the first stage, a person will be injected at intervals over a period of several weeks with increasingly concentrated doses of the allergen. During the second phase, they will receive monthly top-up injections of the the allergen at a uniform dose.",Prevention,"Whilst it is not always possible to avoid pollen and other allergens completely, it is
possible to take precautions against hay fever. Making changes to one's daily routine and
environment can reduce a person's exposure to airborne pollen.","To prevent pollen exposure as one goes about one's day is advisable to stay indoors as much as possible. Drinking plenty of fluids throughout the day can help to prevent allergic reactions. It is also advisable to avoid using tobacco products, particularly smoking, which can aggravate the symptoms of hay fever by irritating the airways. Breathing moist air (from hot water) can also help to alleviate the congestion associated with hay fever.","To exclude pollen from the home environment, keeping the windows and doors shut is reccomended. It is also advisible to change into freshly washed clothes when you reenter the house and  cleaning any domestic air vents and installing a pollen filter in your car can also help reduce contact with allergens. When one is outside, it is helpful to avoid cut grass and fresh flowers.",Hay fever FAQs,"Q: Does antihistamine cause tiredness?
A: Many systemic antihistamines cause drowsiness as a side-effect. Doctors often
advise taking varieties of antihistamine which cause tiredness at night time. When sourcing
medication for hay fever, it is important to find out whether tiredness is one of its side
effects, as this will make it unsafe to drive or operate heavy machinery.","Q: Is there a cure for hay fever?
A: There is no absolute cure for allergic rhinitis, but the right treatment plan can
reduce symptoms significantly and enable a normal quality of life. Immunotherapy/hyposensitization
therapy can achieve long-term pollen desensitization to specific triggers.","Q: Can hay fever be mistaken for other conditions?
A: Hay fever shares many symptoms with the common cold. If you have been suffering
from cold-like symptoms including nasal congestion and sneezing for over two weeks, it is
advisable to seek a medical opinion as you may be suffering from hay fever.",Read more about the Common Cold »

,,,,,,,,,,What is a headache?,"Headaches are characterized by pain in any part of the head. They are second only to the common cold as the most frequently-heard medical complaint and manifest in many different forms – all with their own causes, triggers and characteristics.[1]","A headache can be localized to one part of the head or affect the whole head; the pain can also vary in sensation, severity and frequency.[2] A range of treatment options are available for headaches, with the chosen method dependent on the type of headache and its causes. In most instances, headaches can be managed effectively through medication, lifestyle changes or a combination of the two.","If you are experiencing headaches, try using the free Ada app to find out more about your symptoms.","Types of headaches – causes, symptoms and treatment","There are many different types of headache – some estimate as many as 150 – with differing causes, triggers and symptoms.[3] However, all can be sorted into two overarching categories: primary and secondary.[4]","
Primary headaches are headaches that are due to the headache condition itself and not to any other cause.
Secondary headaches are headaches that are symptomatic of another condition, e.g. a sinus headache from sinusitis.
",The most common types of headache include:,"
Tension headache
Migraines
Cluster headache
Sinus headache
Hormonal headache
Caffeine-triggered headache
Hypertension headache

","If you are experiencing headaches, try using the free Ada app to find out more about your symptoms.",Tension headaches,"Tension headaches, or stress headaches, are the most common type of headache in adults. They are classified as a primary headache, as they are not a symptom of another condition or injury. The principal trigger of tension headaches is thought to be stress, either a single stressful situation or a buildup of stress over a long period of time. Additional triggers may include lack of sleep, weather changes, excessive muscular tension, especially in the neck and shoulder area, and, in some people, the after effects of drinking alcohol.[5][6]","The sensation associated with a tension headache is often described as a dull pain or pressure around the head, usually on both sides, or the neck. Although they can be considerably painful, in most cases, the pain of a tension headache is mild to moderate and will not affect an individual’s ability to work or carry out daily tasks. If tension headaches occur under 15 times per month, they are classified as episodic tension headaches, whereas if they occur 15 times or more per month they are classified as chronic tension headaches. Both can last anywhere from around 30 minutes to a number of days, though chronic headaches will generally last longer.","Pain medication such as aspirin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen and naproxen can be effective in treating a tension headache.[7] Taking measures to reduce stress, such as exercise, meditation, therapy or using breathing techniques, can also be effective in preventing the onset of a tension headache, but are most effective when practiced on a regular basis.","If tension headaches are frequent and continuously treated with analgesics, there is a chance that the headaches may become chronic. This may be due to medicine-overuse syndrome, otherwise known as analgesic rebound, in which medication ceases to provide relief and may actually contribute to the headaches themselves.",Read more about Tension Headaches »,Medication-overuse headaches,"Medication-overuse headaches are headaches caused by taking of painkillers or triptan medications typically used to treat headaches and migraines. Although named an overuse headache, in most cases, these headaches will occur as a result of taking the medication in the correct quantity, as prescribed by the doctor. Once identified, the treatment method is to stop the consumption of the medication and for an alternative to be found.",Migraines,"Migraines are powerful primary headaches which are often accompanied by severe pain and throbbing, nausea, light sensitivity, hypersensitivity to sounds and vomiting.[8] In 60 percent of cases, a migraine is  limited to one side of the head, and can be triggered by stress, hormonal changes, certain foods (including alcohol, cheese and certain additives), caffeine, changes in the weather and tiredness, among other factors. They can also have a significant hereditary component, with the approximate calculation that, if both parents suffer from migraines, a child has a 75 percent chance of inheriting the condition. A migraine can last anywhere from a few hours to a number of days.","Pain relievers such as triptans, ergotamine, aspirin and ibuprofen are the usual drugs prescribed to individuals experiencing migraines. In extreme cases, when migraines are frequent and intensely painful, preventative medication may be prescribed. These can include drugs like beta blockers (e.g. propanolol), antidepressants, e.g. amitriptyline, and certain anti-seizure drugs (e.g. topiramate).[9]",Read more about Migraines »,Cluster headaches,"Cluster headaches are a type of primary headache without a known cause.[10] Cluster headaches occur as a series of relatively short but severely painful headaches, often during the night.  They will generally occur every day for a number of weeks or months at a time. In most cases, cluster headaches will happen at the same time each year. However, some people will go for long periods without experiencing headaches; 2 years is the average length of remission, but this can be anywhere between 2 months and 20 years.","The pain associated with cluster headaches is often described as a powerful burning or throbbing sensation, which is usually limited to one side of the head, as well as behind or around one eye. Pain will usually also be accompanied by the secretion of tears, a red eye, nasal stuffiness, a swollen eyelid, a drooping eyelid, constriction of the pupil and/or sweating from the face and forehead, all limited to the same side of the head as the headache. A cluster headache will tend to last for a short period of time – roughly 30 to 90 minutes – most often one to three times per day over a number of weeks or months.","Ordinary pain relievers such as aspirin, ibuprofen and opioids tend to be ineffective against this type of headache. To treat an acute cluster headache, the inhalation of oxygen or lidocaine nasal drops are two of the preferred methods.",Read more about Cluster Headaches »,Sinus headaches,"The sinuses are hollow cavities in the cheekbones, behind the forehead and in the nose. When they become inflamed, most commonly as a consequence of an infection or an allergic reaction, the pressure that builds up can result in headache-like pain, termed as sinus headaches.[11] The pain of a sinus headache can be constant, range from mild pressure to severe pain, and is sometimes accompanied by a fever, runny nose and swelling of the face as signs that the sinuses are inflamed.",Decongestants are the prefered method of treatment. Antibiotics may also be prescribed in cases where headaches are being caused by bacterial sinusitis.,Hormonal headaches,"Fluctuating levels of the hormone estrogen during the menstrual cycle, pregnancy and menopause, as well as a result of certain contraceptives (contraceptive pills, for example) and hormone replacement therapy, can lead to acute or chronic headaches in women. When particularly severe, these headaches are described as menstrual migraines and may be accompanied by some of the other symptoms of a migraine, such as nausea and vomiting.[12]",Pain relievers and triptans can be effective in treating hormone headaches.[13],Caffeine-triggered headaches,"Caffeine headaches are typically a symptom of caffeine withdrawal or sensitivity. Those who consume caffeine sporadically or who consume a large amount of caffeine within a short amount of time, are typically more at risk of caffeine headaches.[14] A caffeine headache can be painful – normally beginning behind the eyes and progressing into the forehead area. In severe cases, a caffeine headache can develop into a migraine.","Treating a caffeine headache may involve the use of over-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers, drinking plenty of fluids or avoiding caffeine completely.",Hypertension headaches,"Hypertension, or high blood pressure, can cause headache in some cases. These headache typically occur in the morning and are located in the back of the head. Malignant hypertension, a condition in which the body’s blood pressure reaches critical levels, can lead to a buildup of pressure in the cranium, which in turn can also trigger head pain or a migraine. This may be accompanied by nausea, chest pain and blurred vision. Those experiencing malignant hypertension should seek medical treatment immediately.[15]","Treating hypertension headaches will invariably involve treating the underlying cause: high blood pressure. However, for immediate relief, pain relievers may be effective.",Read more about Hypertension »,Hangover headaches,"Hangover headaches, or alcohol-induced headaches, are a common form of headache that typically manifests the day after excessive consumption of alcohol. The pain will, in most cases, be felt on both sides of the head, be throbbing or pulsating in sensation and worsen with physical activity. Alcohol can also act as a trigger for migraines.[16]","A hangover headache can be treated with over-the-counter (OTC) pain medications and rehydration, as in drinking plenty of water over the day.",Read more about a hangover »,Exertion headaches,"Exertion headaches – or activity-related headaches – are typically triggered by lengthy periods of physical exercise and are most common in younger people under 50.[17] The headache will usually develop as the exercise reaches its peak, and fade when the exertion stops. However, in rare cases, the headache can last significantly longer. An exertion headache can be painful and may be accompanied by symptoms such as nausea and vomiting.","Anti-inflammatory drugs can be effective in treating an exertion headache. In rare cases, this type of headache can be a sign of a more serious condition, including aneurysm and brain tumors, so professional medical advice should be sought if the problem persists.[18]",Tumor headaches,"Headaches are one of the most common symptoms of a brain tumor. Tumor headaches are typically characterized by their persistence, yet may still fade after a number of hours or days, and may be accompanied by vomiting.

Frontal (front of the head): tension headache, migraine, sinus headache, caffeine-triggered headache, hangover headache, hypertension headache
Temporal (side of the head): tension headache, hangover headache
Occipital (back of the head): tension headache, hypertension headache
Middle or top of the head: tension headache
One side of the head: migraine, cluster headache
Behind or around the eyes: cluster headache, caffeine-triggered headache
",Diagnosing headaches,"In order to receive appropriate treatment, it is important to describe the nature of a headache to the doctor fully, making sure to include information such as:[22]","
How long a person has been experiencing headaches
Age of onset
How often the headaches occur
Suspected triggers for the headaches (foods, medication, etc.)
If any family members experience similar headaches
The location and severity of the pain
How long the headaches last
Whether there are any other symptoms that occur besides the headaches
","Following the investigation of a person’s medical history, a doctor will typically perform a comprehensive physical and neurological exam in order to identify any underlying conditions that may be causing the headaches.","This will involve testing for conditions such as high blood pressure, infection, brain tumors and head trauma. If no underlying condition can be found, the diagnosis will likely conclude that an individual is suffering from a primary headache type (tension, cluster or a migraine).","In rare cases, further tests may be called for.

","If headaches persist, professional medical attention should always be sought.","Q: What is the difference between a migraine and a headache?
A: A migraine is one of many types of headaches. However, it is important to differentiate between a migraine and any other type of headache, as this will allow the sufferer to seek appropriate treatment  more quickly. The level and type of pain being experienced is the main way to tell the difference. The pain associated with a migraine will typically be severe, throbbing and, in 60 percent of cases, affect just one side of the head. A migraine may also be accompanied by nausea, pain in one eye or ear and pain in the temples, among other symptoms. A tension headache, another common type of headache, on the other hand, will typically involve less intense pain (though can be severe) and will generally affect both sides of the head. A doctor’s opinion should always be sought when a new type of headache occurs. A doctor will be able to differentiate between a migraine and other types of headache and recommend appropriate treatment options."

A: Newborn babies typically have higher hemoglobin levels than older children and adults. The developing body of a baby consumes an elevated amount of oxygen, roughly three times that of adults based on weight, which in turn increases the need for hemoglobin. A hemoglobin count of 15 gm/dL is considered optimum for newborn babies.[14]"
,,,,,,,,,,What is hemophilia?
,,,,,,,,,,What is hemophilia?,"Hemophilia is a hereditary genetic bleeding disorder which causes blood clotting problems due to a lack in the proteins needed for normal blood clotting to take place. This causes people with hemophilia to bleed more than other people, for example, after injuries or surgeries. This condition is passed on the X chromosome, and for this reason, affects males more commonly than females. Diagnosis is made based on the symptoms, whether a family member is known to have hemophilia and by testing the clotting function of the blood. Preventing injuries and taking extra clotting proteins are two ways to prevent the complications of this condition. With good management, the outlook for people with hemophilia is good, although it depends on the severity of the clotting factor deficiency.",Risks,"Hemophilia is an inherited bleeding disorder caused by mutation in a gene. The blood clotting problems occur because people with hemophilia have a lack of the proteins needed for normal blood clotting to take place. There are two types of hemophilia, type A (the more severe and common type) and type B (also known as Christmas disease). In mild hemophilia, a person’s blood has some ability to clot, but in people with the severe type, the blood may have very few or no clotting proteins at all. Because it is a genetic disorder, hemophilia tends to run in families, however, around one third of people diagnosed are the first person in their family to have hemophilia. These people can pass the gene to their children. This gene is on the X chromosome and therefore, because they only have one, males are more likely to have hemophilia than females.",Symptoms,"People with hemophilia tend to bruise or bleed excessively after small incidents or procedures. They may have a tendency to bruise, or to have severe episodes of nose bleeding, gum bleeding or even bleeding into joints. Women with hemophilia may have heavy periods. People with hemophilia are also at increased risk of bleeding in the bowel, which may cause red or black bowel movements.",Diagnosis,"The diagnosis is based on the symptoms of the affected person, whether any other people in the family are known to have hemophilia, physical examination and tests for the ability of the blood to clot. Blood tests may reveal that the blood takes longer than usual to clot, and low levels or an absence of some of the proteins needed for normal blood clotting.",Treatment,"Treatment of hemophilia depends on the ability of the blood to clot. People whose blood has some ability to clot may receive an injection to improve blood clotting before they have a procedure which may cause bleeding, such as dental work. People whose blood has little or no ability to clot alone may need to have regular injection to protect them in case of accidents. Treatment should be carried out by an expert in the field. People with hemophilia should wear a medic alert bracelet or carry a ID card with them in case of emergencies.",Prevention,Preventing injuries is very important to avoid bleeding.

Banding treatment: The most common procedure used to treat hemorrhoids, usually grade 2 or 3. It involves wrapping a rubber band around the base of the hemorrhoid swelling, thus draining the swelling of blood. The band is left there and will eventually cause the hemorrhoid to fall off. This will normally happen after a few days. The procedure is typically painless.
Injection sclerotherapy: Special oil is injected into the base of the hemorrhoid in order to cut off the blood supply. This causes the swelling to drop off.
Infrared and laser coagulation: Infrared or laser energy is used to cut off the blood supply to the hemorrhoid swellings, causing them to shrink. This procedure is often accompanied by a feeling of some pain and heat.
Laser therapy: CO2 lasers are used to cauterise or vaporise hemorrhoids. This is an outpatient procedure, and because the laser seals blood vessels as it cuts the hemorrhoid away, stitches are unnecessary. The procedure generally has minimal pain and speedy recovery.
Electrotherapy/Diathermy: An electric current is used to destroy the hemorrhoids. The procedure is generally painless.
",Surgery,"Surgical treatment methods are usually reserved for cases of severe hemorrhoids (grade 3 or 4), when other less invasive treatment methods have proven unsuccessful. A doctor will be able to advise on the best option case-by-case.","
Hemorrhoidectomy: The hemorrhoids are cut away by a surgeon while the individual is under general anaesthetic. It is usually successful in treating hemorrhoids.
Stapled hemorrhoidopexy: Less painful than a hemorrhoidectomy, this procedure involves cutting out a circular portion of the mucosa of the anal canal and rectum involving the hemorrhoids. This pulls the hemorrhoids back up the anal canal, cutting off their blood supply and causing them to shrink.
Hemorrhoidal artery ligation: The blood vessels around the anal canal that provide blood to the hemorrhoids are tied, causing the hemorrhoids to shrink.

Each of these viruses is highly
contagious and most common in children younger than 7 years of age.[5] Children are
more susceptible to these viruses because they do not yet possess the antibodies that defend against it. However, it is possible for the condition to affect a person of any age.","Typically, the virus is spread when fecal matter from an infected individual comes into
contact with the mouth area. This fecal matter can be carried on the hands, as well as on
objects or surfaces. The virus can also be spread via the spray from a cough or sneeze of
a person with herpangina.",Diagnosing herpangina,"Diagnostic tests are not typically necessary to identify herpangina. Although many of the
symptoms of the virus are common to other conditions, the ulcers are unique, meaning a doctor
will be able to diagnose the virus with a simple examination and questions about the
individual’s other symptoms and medical history.[6]",Herpangina treatment,"The infection causing herpangina will usually go away without any particular treatment.
Antibiotics are not needed, because the conditon is caused by a virus. However, there are
treatments available to relieve the symptoms caused by the infection.",The most common treatments for the symptoms of herpangina are:,"
Ibuprofen: Used to ease pain and lessen fever.
Acetaminophen/paracetamol: Used to ease pain and lessen fever.
Anaesthetics: Numbing throat lozenges, mouthwashes, or teething gels may be helpful
to reduce the pain caused by herpangina.
Fluids: To avoid dehydration, it is important to take in plenty of fluids during
infection and recovery. Water and cold milk are typically recommended as they are easy
to swallow and can have a soothing effect. Citrus and hot drinks should be avoided because
they can be painful to swallow.
","Aspirin should be avoided as a treatment method, particularly for children and teenagers,
who should avoid aspirin completely unless asked to take it by a doctor.",Herpangina FAQs,"Q: Can adults contract herpangina?
A: Yes, herpangina can occur in people of any age, though the virus is most common in
children younger than 7 years of age.","Q: Are there any home remedies for herpangina?
A: There are some home remedies to treat herpangina, mostly aimed at alleviating the
pain from mouth ulcers or a sore throat. One of the most common is the use of ice. Apply
chunks of ice directly to the ulcer for at least 10 minutes twice per day. This should help
ease the swelling and lessen the pain. When recovering from herpangina, gargling with salt
water can help the mouth ulcers to heal.[^8]","Q: How can I avoid spreading herpangina?
A: To avoid spreading herpangina, those experiencing the condition should avoid extended
contact with others and stay home from work or school while feeling unwell. When coughing
or sneezing, individuals should take care to cover their mouth and nose, and be sure to wash
their hands thoroughly at regular intervals.","Q: Does herpangina pose any risks during pregnancy?
A: Herpangina does pose a risk of adverse effects during pregnancy. Women worried about
herpangina during pregnancy should consult a doctor for advice and take preventative measures
to avoid the virus in the first instance.","Q: Can herpangina cause a skin rash?
A: Some enteroviral infections can cause skin rashes, also known as exanthems. Although
the coxsackievirus that causes herpangina can cause a rash, it is atypical and should be
examined by a doctor.[7]","Q: What do the sores associated with herpangina look like?
A: The sores, otherwise referred to as lesions or erythematous macules, that form in the rear of the mouth and throat as a symptom of herpangina are typically light red in colour and in most cases smaller than 5mm. In the later ulcerative stage of the condition, the ulcers can typically be distinguished by their light grey colour and red border. The Ada app can help you check your symptoms. Download the free app or find out more about how it works.","Q: Is herpangina related to herpes?
A: Despite the similar sounding names, herpangina and herpes are not related. Both conditions cause ulcers, sores or lesions, but in different locations, moreover the two conditions are caused by separate viruses: herpangina by coxsackieviruses (coxsackie A and B), enterovirus 71 and echovirus, and herpes by herpes simplex 1 (HSV1) and 2 (HSV2).","A: Do enteroviruses cause any other conditions?
Q: Enteroviruses are a group of viruses that cause a range of viral illnesses. The two most common enteroviruses are coxsackieviruses and echovirus. Away from herpangina, enteroviruses can also cause hand, foot and mouth (HFM) disease, epidemic pleurodynia and polio, among other infectious disorders.[8]",Other names for herpangina,"

,,,,,,,,,,What is herpes labialis?
,,,,,,,,,,What is herpes labialis?,"Herpes labialis, or cold sores, is a viral infection caused by herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), which is the type most commonly associated with cold sores, or herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2), which is usually associated with genital herpes. Herpes labialis presents with painful blisters of the lips and facial area near the mouth. It is highly contagious, and it is estimated that 50% to 80% of the adult population in the USA carries the herpes simplex 1 virus.[1]","Most people are infected with herpes labialis in childhood, after which it lies dormant in the nervous system, usually in major nerves of the upper body.[2] Stress can cause the virus to reactivate, leading to an outbreak of the blisters. Herpes labialis outbreaks that result from a reactivated infection are known as recurrent infections. Because the blisters often occur during or just after an illness, such as a cold or flu, they are colloquially known as “cold sores” or “fever blisters.” The condition is also sometimes called orofacial herpes or oral herpes.","Although herpes labialis is contagious, painful and unsightly, it is a very minor infection in most people. However, there can be serious health consequences if newborn babies (see FAQs) or people who are immunosuppressed are affected .",Herpes labialis symptoms,"Because cold sores are recurrent, they typically arise after encountering triggers such as sunburn or illness, and it is possible to predict when they are likely to occur and therefore to be vigilant about symptoms. Redness and tingling at a particular site around the mouth and lips often the first sign that herpes labialis is occurring. Shortly thereafter, fluid-filled blisters appear. If you are concerned that you or someone you know may have cold sores, the Ada app can help you check your symptoms. Find out more about how the app works.","Good to know: Herpes labialis caused by herpes simplex virus 1 is contagious, and recurrent infection can occur, which means that an affected person may experience the same symptoms every time they have an outbreak.","Patients may be completely asymptomatic at the time of their first infection with herpes simplex virus 1 or herpes simplex virus 2, but in some cases symptoms do appear. In children, these include:","
Fever
Gingivostomatitis, i.e. inflammation and blisters on all oral mucosa, including the lips, tongue and inside of the mouth.
","In adults, symptoms of herpes labialis resulting from herpes simplex virus 1 can include:","
Sore throat
Swollen cervical lymph nodes
","Formerly, most people were exposed to herpes simplex virus 1 and herpes simplex virus 2 as children. However, the age of first exposure has been rising in the West, and it is now common to be infected for the first time via oral-genital contact.[2]",Herpes labialis differential diagnosis,"It is important to distinguish between cold sores and other skin infections of the face and mouth.[3] If pus is present, it is more likely to be a pimple or boil. If the blister is inside the mouth, it is a mouth ulcer rather than a cold sore. The first time an HSV infection occurs, however, it can present with mouth ulcers.","Impetigo, which can co-occur with cold sores in warm and humid climates, first manifests as pus-filled blisters that form golden-brown scabs. As impetigo is a bacterial infection, it will not respond to cold sore treatments. Blisters resulting from impetigo often spread further around the lips and mouth than cold sores do. If it is not clear whether the blisters are cold sores or impetigo, it is best to consult a physician.[4]",Herpes labialis causes and transmission,"Herpes labialis is very contagious. It is spread by coming into contact with the virus via the cold sore itself, coming into contact with the saliva of someone who currently has a blister, or by sharing plates, cups, eating utensils, towels, face-cloths, toothbrushes, tooth-mugs or razors with someone who currently has a cold sore. People who have a family member or intimate partner with an active cold sore are most at risk.",An outbreak of herpes labialis is caused by the reactivation of a dormant herpes simplex virus 1 or herpes simplex virus 2 infection. Factors that can cause the infection to reactivate and lead to recurrent infection include:[1][2],"
Fever
Illness, particularly upper respiratory tract infections
A weakened immune system
Dental work
Menstruation
Exposure to strong sunlight; cold sores often follow sunburn on the face
Physical stress such as surgery
Emotional or psychological stress
Eczema
","Transmission of the herpes simplex 1 virus can also occur through kissing or by oral-genital contact. Oral-genital contact with someone who has a cold sore can cause genital herpes.[2] Two closely-related viruses cause herpes labialis: HSV-1 and HSV-2. HSV-2 is more often the cause of genital herpes, though both can be spread by oral sex, and both can cause genital herpes.[1] Most people experience fewer reactivations of the infection after the age of 35.",Herpes labialis stages,Herpes labialis infections have several stages:[5][6][7],"
Prodromal or tingle stage: This stage lasts one or two days, during which the patient experiences tingling and possibly reddening at the site at which the blister will appear. Cold sores may repeatedly occur at the same site. If treatment is administered during this stage, the entire duration of the infection can be shortened.
Blister stage: This stage lasts for two or three days, during which blisters appear on and around the lips, philtrum or nostrils. The appearance of the blisters is usually accompanied by mild pain, which can be worsened by speaking, laughing or eating.
Weeping stage: This stage is the most painful. It lasts one to three days, during which time the blisters rupture and may weep clear fluid.
Crusting stage: The blisters form a scab. This phase is often itchy. Patients often find this stage the most troublesome, due to the itchiness.
Healing stage: In this phase, the scabs fall off. Small, temporary scars may be present while the skin heals.
","It should be noted that herpes labialis is contagious in all stages, but particularly so during stage three. The infection usually resolves on its own, and a person will stop being contagious to others when the skin heals.","If you are not sure if this matches what you’ve been experiencing, check your symptoms with Ada.",Herpes labialis treatment,Cold sores are easily treated. Various medications and home remedies can be used to manage herpes labialis caused by herpes simplex virus 1.,Herpes labialis medication,"If the patient is vigilant and recognises the herpes labialis infection while it is still in the tingle stage, a topical over-the-counter antiviral cream, such as an acyclovir cream, can be applied. This will shorten the lifespan of the blister considerably. Applying creams once the blister has appeared is less effective. Antivirals that are commonly used against herpes labialis are aciclovir/acyclovir,, and penciclovir, also known as pencyclovir.[2]","Alternatively, creams such as zinc oxide, zinc sulfate or anesthetic creams may be applied to give relief. Although these creams reduce painfulness and can shorten the lifespan of the blister, they are not as effective as antiviral creams.","Oral antivirals (tablets) are sometimes prescribed by doctors, usually for very severe cases. Most cases of herpes labialis do not need oral antivirals, and they are only really effective if treatment begins during the prodromal phase. However, if a patient has already developed blisters, doctors may prescribe oral antivirals, so that the patient has them on hand to use as prophylaxis in case of future outbreaks, rather than for use in the current outbreak.","There is some evidence that oral antivirals can be most effective if they’re prescribed in cases where a patient’s cold sores have a known trigger, such as strong sunlight.[8]  In such cases, making sure that the affected person has oral antivirals to hand immediately after experiencing a trigger, means that they will be able to stop the outbreak before it moves out of the prodromal phase. This is known as “suppressive” therapy. It is a form of herpes labialis prophylaxis.","Valciclovir, also known as valcyclovir, is often administered in 2g doses twice daily and can reduce duration. Likewise, 400mg of aciclovir/acyclovir, taken five times daily for five days, decreases the pain of the blisters and speeds healing.[9] Famiciclovir, also known as famcyclovir, may be prescribed in very severe cases.[5] There is no evidence that combining oral antivirals and topical antivirals reduces the lifespan of the cold sore more than using one or the other alone would.[8]",Herpes labialis home remedies,"There are a number of home remedies for cold sores, but these are mostly effective in reducing discomfort rather than the duration of the infection. Applying Vaseline or aloe vera to the blisters may reduce pain and will cause no harm.[5] Some herbal remedies that may help with relieving the discomfort and/or promoting healing when applied topically are:[10][11]","
Lemon balm, also known as melissa. Ointments, such as Lomaherpan or LomaProtect contain lemon balm. Alternatively, lemon balm essential oil can be applied directly.
Tea tree essential oil, applied to the affected area.
","Do not take essential oils internally. If you have sensitive skin, be sure to dilute them in a carrier oil.",Ice can reduce swelling and relieve pain. People with cold sores may also wish to:,"
Avoid acidic or salty foods, as they will cause pain to the blister
Avoid touching their mouth or lips
Avoid opening the mouth widely, in a way that stretches the lips[3]
Avoid shaving the affected area
Eat soft, bland foods
","Because herpes labialis spreads easily, they may also wish to:","
Avoid oral sex
Avoid kissing anyone
Avoid coming into close contact with small children, toddlers, babies and especially newborns
Avoid sharing anything that comes into contact with the mouth
",FAQs,"Q: Is a herpes simplex infection dangerous if I have a weakened immune system?
A: It can be. In immunosuppressed or immunocompromised people, the blisters may spread to cover large areas and become very painful. They are not always limited to the mouth and face, but may occur on any mucosal surface including the genitals. Also, there might not be external blisters to indicate an active internal herpes simplex infection. If left untreated, the infection can be fatal.[12] If you are concerned that you may have a weakened immune system, or if your symptoms seem severe, consult the free Ada app for a symptom assessment.","Q: Why is an HSV infection serious for babies?
A: Herpes simplex infections in very young children, also called neonatal herpes, can be fatal to babies and newborns. The virus spreads to the child’s internal organs and has to be treated with intravenous antiviral drugs. Even so, it is often fatal.[13]","If your child has been exposed to herpes and shows any of the following symptoms, it is advisable to seek medical assistance as soon as possible:","
Listlessness and abnormal sleepiness
Unwillingness to eat
Floppiness
Fever
Breathing difficulties, including grunting, rapid breathing, or blue skin
High-pitched crying
Skin rash
","If you are concerned that your baby may have an HSV infection, consult the Ada app for a symptom assessment.","Q: Does the same virus cause herpes labialis and shingles?
A: No. Shingles and cold sores are not caused by the same virus, even though both manifest as painful skin lesions and are the result of a dormant viral infection reactivating. Shingles is caused by varicella zoster, while herpes labialis is the result of an HSV infection.. However, the viruses that cause herpes labialis (HSV-1 and HSV-2) are related to the virus that causes shingles (varicella zoster): all three are subtypes of the Human Herpes Virus.

,,,,,,,,,,What is herpes simplex?
,,,,,,,,,,What is herpes simplex?,"Herpes simplex, typically referred to as “herpes” or HSV, is a viral infection caused by
the herpes simplex virus. The virus comes in two varieties: Herpes type one (HSV-1) and
herpes type two (HSV-2). Although it can occasionally cause genital herpes, herpes type one
(also called herpes labialis) generally leads to sores around the mouth, whereas herpes type
two generally leads to genital sores. These sores, also known as cold sores or fever
blisters, can be painful but are generally manageable. As yet, there is no known cure for
the herpes simplex virus.[1]",Symptoms of herpes simplex,"Many people who contract the herpes simplex virus do not display any signs or symptoms of
infection. If an individual does begin to display symptoms they will normally develop within
2 to 20 days after the initial infection and may include:[2]","
Itching or burning sensation: This generally precedes the development of sores and
can occur around the mouth or genitals.
Sores: May occur singularly or in clusters. Sores begin as fluid-filled blisters and
will generally ooze and crust over before healing. Typically, they last for between 7 and
10 days. Oral herpes will normally cause sores to appear on the face or lips, whereas the
penis, vagina, buttocks or anus are the most common locations for genital herpes sores.
Flu-like symptoms: Fatigue, muscle pain, fever and swollen glands in the neck or genital
area are possible.
Urination problems: People with genital herpes (especially women) may experience pain
or a burning sensation when urinating.
Eye infection: The herpes simplex virus may spread to the eyes, resulting in possible
pain, discharge and light sensitivity. If left untreated, the infection can lead to scarring
on the outer layer of the eye. The infection is sometimes referred to as keratitis and
occurs in less than five percent of cases.
",See this resouce for more information on the signs of herpes.,"After the initial infection, herpes simplex can exist in a dormant (latent) state, wherein
no symptoms present themselves but the virus is still present within the body. Latent
herpes simplex can reactivate because of a number of factors, including fever, menstruation
and emotional stress.",Causes of herpes simplex,"Herpes simplex is transmitted through skin to skin contact between an individual infected
with the virus and an individual who is not. The carrier of the infection does not need to
have symptoms of the infection in order for it to be transmitted. The infection is highly
contagious.","Oral herpes commonly develops – especially in children – through activities such as kissing
or sharing eating utensils or toothbrushes. Genital herpes is typically transmitted through
sexual activity, including:[3]","
Unprotected sex (vaginal or anal)
Sharing sex toys
Close genital contact
",It is also possible for mothers to pass on the herpes simplex virus to their child during birth.,Diagnosing herpes simplex,"The most common method for diagnosing herpes simplex of both types is a physical examination.
A doctor will examine the blisters and sores, inquire about other symptoms, and will generally
be able to make a diagnosis on the basis of these.","To confirm the presence of the virus, a laboratory test – known as a herpes viral culture
of lesions test – can also be performed. To do so, a sample of fluid is taken from the sores
and sent to a lab for testing.[4] Tests are also available to differentiate between herpes
simplex virus one and two, including immunofluorescence staining and the immunoblot test (IgG).[5]","If there are no visible symptoms of the virus, blood tests can be ordered to diagnose an
infection with the herpes simplex virus. This is known as a serum herpes simplex antibodies
test. After taking blood, the sample will be sent to a laboratory and be tested, not for
the virus itself, but for the presence of the antibodies produced by the body to fight the
virus.[6]",Treatment of herpes simplex,"There is no cure for the herpes simplex virus. However, treatments aimed at lessening the
symptoms and controlling recurrent outbreaks are available. The most common treatment method
is the use of antiviral creams and ointments. To be most effective, the creams and ointments
should be used as soon as the symptoms of herpes appear. The affected area should be kept
clean and dry, and no other lotions or ointments should be applied unless they are recommended
by a doctor. If the herpes sores are occurring frequently, it may be advised to use the
treatments everyday, even when no visible symptoms are present – this is known as suppressive
therapy. Medications are usually used for suppressive therapy, the most common being acyclovir,
valacyclovir and famciclovir.[7]",Herpes simplex prevention,"Herpes simplex is most commonly spread by skin to skin contact, as well as through objects
that have been in contact with herpes sores. Those that have been infected with the virus
should take a number of measures to lessen the risk of transmitting herpes simplex. These
include:","
Avoid kissing during an outbreak, when the chances of transmitting the virus are highest
Avoid sharing things like toothbrushes and eating utensils
Avoid touching the sores (if impossible, ensure the hands are thoroughly washed before
coming into contact with anyone else)
","To reduce the risk of spreading or contracting genital herpes, the most effective method
is to use a condom during vaginal, oral and anal sex. Condoms, however, do not cover all
parts of the genital area, meaning they do not guarantee full protection.[8]","During an outbreak of the virus, sexual activity should be avoided completely, as this is
when the chances of transmitting the virus are highest. Sharing sex toys should always be
avoided. Complete protection against the virus can only be guaranteed through full abstention
from sexual activity.",Herpes simplex prognosis,"In otherwise healthy children and adults, herpes simplex rarely leads to any severe
complications. However, newborn babies and people with weakened immune systems can suffer
severe and serious complications. One complication that has been linked to herpes simplex
is encephalitis – a rare but potentially life-threatening condition affecting the brain.[9]","When newborn babies or people with weakened immune systems show symptoms of the virus,
professional medical attention should be sought quickly.","In all cases, the virus never leaves the body and may lay dormant indefinitely. The first
outbreak (the primary outbreak) is generally the most aggressive, with recurrences typically
milder and less painful.[9]",Herpes simplex FAQs,"Q: Can I catch herpes on parts of the body that aren’t the mouth or genitals?
A: The herpes simplex virus normally affects either the mouth (type one) or the genitals
(type 2). However, though rare, the virus can also affect other parts of the body such as
the fingers (known as herpetic whitlow), the nipples and the arms. When this happens, the
virus is normally spread from the mouth or genitals.","Q: Can I pass on herpes simplex when displaying no symptoms?
A: Yes. Even when the virus is dormant, it can still be passed on. However, this is less
likely than when physical symptoms are present.[10]","Q: Can I catch genital herpes from kissing on the mouth?
A: This is unlikely. Kissing can transmit the herpes simplex virus type 1, which can
cause both oral and genital herpes. However, kissing on the mouth will not cause the
development of symptoms on the genitals."

",People with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop ocular complications from ophthalmic shingles.,Postherpetic neuralgia,"Some people with herpes zoster ophthalmicus will experience postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), which is pain that lasts after the rash and blisters disappear. Symptoms include:[2][4]","
Pain in the eye and area of the face affected by herpes zoster ophthalmicus. This may be constant or intermittent.
Allodynia, which is when pain is triggered by non-painful stimuli, such as light touch or wind blowing on the face.
",The number of people who will experience postherpetic neuralgia ranges from 10 to 30 percent.[4],"The experience of living with postherpetic neuralgia may affect a person’s mental health, for example it can increase the risk of  clinical depression.",Causes of herpes zoster ophthalmicus,"People at risk of developing ophthalmic shingles are those who have previously had chickenpox. Herpes zoster infection occurs years, sometimes decades, after a person has been infected with the varicella zoster virus that causes chickenpox.","The virus remains dormant (inactive) in the nervous system and can reactivate if a person’s immunity to varicella zoster weakens over time, either due to age or if a person is immunosuppressed. In ophthalmic shingles, the virus reactivates in the trigeminal ganglion, a cluster of nerves located to the sides and base of the skull. The trigeminal ganglion is connected to the opthalmic nerve and this is how the infection affects the eye.[4]",People with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop herpes zoster ophthalmicus than the general population.,Diagnosis of herpes zoster ophthalmicus,"A diagnosis can usually be made based on the symptoms and the appearance of the rash, as well as through an examination of the eye. If uncertain, the diagnosis can be confirmed with blood tests or by taking a sample of fluid from a blister and testing for the virus.",An ophthalmologist should examine the eye for signs of corneal disease and other eye problems.[8],Prevention of herpes zoster ophthalmicus,"People who have shingles should keep away from people who have not been vaccinated against chickenpox (especially newborns) and people who have a weak immune system. Although shingles itself cannot be passed from person to person, the varicella zoster virus which causes chickenpox can be transmitted through contact with the fluid in the rash blisters.[9]",Vaccination against chickenpox (the varicella vaccination) and herpes zoster (a herpes zoster vaccination) can help to prevent and reduce the severity of some cases of shingles.,Vaccination for herpes zoster infection,Vaccination against chickenpox (the varicella vaccination) and herpes zoster (a herpes zoster vaccination) can help to prevent and reduce the severity of some cases of shingles.,"The Centers for Disease Control recommends that all healthy adults aged 50 and older should receive the shingles vaccine.

,,,,,,,,,,What is hypertensive retinopathy
,,,,,,,,,,What is hypertensive retinopathy,"Hypertensive retinopathy (HR) is a possible complication of high blood pressure (hypertension). Persistent, untreated high blood pressure can cause damage to the retina, the tissues at the back of the eye responsible for receiving the images we need to see.","The condition can lead to symptoms including double or dim vision, loss of vision and headaches. Treating hypertensive retinopathy typically involves controlling high blood pressure through lifestyle changes, medication and careful monitoring. Through this, the condition can be halted, and the damage may slowly heal.",People experiencing possible symptoms of hypertensive retinopathy can use free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.,Causes of hypertensive retinopathy,"Hypertensive retinopathy is an eyesight disorder that occurs as a result of high blood pressure. High blood pressure, also called hypertension, occurs when the force of blood against the artery walls is too high, causing the arteries to stretch, narrow and become damaged over time.",Hypertensive retinopathy occurs when the blood vessels supplying blood to the retina in the back of the eye become damaged. The likelihood of damage to the retina increases with the severity of high blood pressure and the length of time over which the condition is experienced.,Older people are most at risk of developing high blood pressure and are therefore also most at risk of developing hypertensive retinopathy.,Other factors that may contribute to the likelihood of developing high blood pressure include:[1],"
Being overweight
A sedentary lifestyle
A diet high in salt
Stress
A family history of high blood pressure
Diabetes
Moderate to high alcohol intake
",Read more about High Blood Pressure »,Signs and symptoms of hypertensive retinopathy,"Most people will only develop symptoms of hypertensive retinopathy after there has already been significant damage to the retina. Before this, it may take a doctor or ophthalmologist (specialist eye doctor) to identify the condition.",Symptoms may include:,"
Double or cloudy vision
Headaches
Loss of vision, when the condition has progressed significantly
","If these symptoms come on very quickly, this can be a sign of severely high blood pressure and should be considered a medical emergency. Call a doctor immediately.","If you think that you may be experiencing symptoms of hypertensive retinopathy, try using the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.",Hypertensive retinopathy stages,Ophthalmologists grade hypertensive retinopathy using four categories or stages. The classification system is known as the Keith Wagener Barker (KWB) grades.[1],"
Grade 1: High blood pressure and narrowing of the arteries is mild. Generally, no symptoms are present.
Grade 2: High blood pressure and narrowing of the arteries is more pronounced. Generally no symptoms are present.
Grade 3: Signs of damage such as retinal haemorrhage (bleeding) and cotton wool spots, i.e. white patches on the retina, are present upon inspection. Symptoms may be present.
Grade 4: Severe Grade 3 plus swelling of the optic disc (papilledema). Symptoms are present.
",Some medical professionals may prefer to use the Mitchell-Wong grading system; a simplified version of the Keith Wagener Barker grades. This system simply combines the first two categories into one.,Hypertensive retinopathy diagnosis,Diagnosing hypertensive retinopathy typically involves an examination by an ophthalmologist based on the symptoms present.,"In some cases, an ophthalmoscope may be used to investigate the retina in the back of the eye. This instrument shines light into the eye, allowing doctors to see any signs of damage.","More rarely, a test known as a fluorescein angiography may be performed to investigate the blood flow into the retina. This involves taking pictures of the eye before and after a special fluorescein dye has been injected into the system and passed through the blood vessels of the eye.[1]",Hypertensive retinopathy treatment,The only way to treat hypertensive retinopathy is by controlling high blood pressure. This can be done through lifestyle changes such as:,"
Giving up smoking
Losing weight
Taking regular exercise
Dietary changes
Reducing alcohol intake
","Medication, such as ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-2 receptor blockers (ARBs), thiazide diuretics, calcium channel-blockers and beta-blockers may also be prescribed to help lower blood pressure levels. These medications can help to allow the retina to heal and stop further damage from occurring.",The type of medication chosen will depend on the affected person’s medical history and a consideration of the possible side-effects.,Hypertensive retinopathy prevention,"Preventing hypertensive retinopathy is possible through careful management of high blood pressure and related conditions, such as diabetes. Lifestyle changes, such as losing weight or giving up smoking, may be useful in achieving this. People with high blood pressure should also have their blood pressure regularly tested and be screened for eye problems.",Hypertensive retinopathy complications,"Individuals with hypertensive retinopathy are at risk of various complications, including:[2]","
Retinal vein occlusion occurs when a vein in the retina becomes blocked due to clots.
Retinal artery occlusion  occurs when an artery in the retina becomes blocked due to clots, resulting in possible loss of vision.
Ischemic optic neuropathy involves the normal blood flow to the eye being blocked, resulting in damage to the optic nerve, the part of the eye which transmits images to the brain.
Malignant hypertension causes blood pressure to increase rapidly, causing possible loss of vision. This is a rare complication, which is potentially life-threatening.
",Hypertensive retinopathy is also linked to an increased risk of stroke and heart attack.,Prognosis,"The outlook for people with mild (grade 1 or 2) hypertensive retinopathy is relatively positive, so long as blood pressure levels are controlled. If, however, severe hypertensive retinopathy is not properly managed, the condition can enter a “malignant” stage, which is associated with a relatively poor prognosis.[3]",Hypertensive retinopathy FAQs,"Q: Can hypertensive retinopathy be reversed?
A: It depends on the extent of damage to the retina. In many cases, the damage caused by hypertensive retinopathy can slowly heal if the necessary steps to lower one’s blood pressure are taken. These steps may include making lifestyle changes such as giving up smoking and losing weight, as well as taking medication as prescribed by a doctor.","Q: What is the difference between hypertensive retinopathy and diabetic retinopathy?
A: Hypertensive retinopathy is caused by high blood pressure. While having high blood pressure can increase the risk of diabetic retinopathy, this condition is a complication of diabetes, meaning anyone with diabetes type 1 or type 2 can potentially develop the condition. Like hypertensive retinopathy, diabetic retinopathy causes damage to the retina at the back of the eye and can, if left untreated, lead to blindness.[4]","Q: Can high blood pressure cause double vision?
A: Yes, double vision can, in some cases, be a symptom of high blood pressure, specifically when high blood pressure has led to hypertensive retinopathy. If this symptom occurs very suddenly, a doctor should be contacted urgently.",Other names for hypertensive retinopathy,"

,,,,,,,,,,What is hyperthyroidism?
,,,,,,,,,,What is hyperthyroidism?,"Hyperthyroidism is a condition where the thyroid gland is overactive, or hyperactive, and causes an excess of thyroid hormone in the body. The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland in the lower part of the neck, below the voice box. Hormones released by the thyroid regulate the body’s metabolism, affecting functions such as heart rate, digestion and temperature.[1][2]","Having too much thyroid hormone, a state which is called thyrotoxicosis, can cause symptoms like difficulty sleeping, nervousness, rapid heartbeat, intolerance to heat and weight loss despite a healthy appetite.[1][2] Hyperthyroidism can affect anyone, of any age, though it seems to be more prevalent among women and older adults. It is not a very common condition.[3] Hypothyroidism, a condition in which the thyroid is underactive and causes a lack of thyroid hormone, is more common.[4] Sometimes, a period of hyperthyroidism can occur as part of thyroiditis, inflammation of the thyroid gland and follow or be followed by hypothyroidism.","Hyperthyroidism may have a number of different causes. The most common is Graves' disease, also known as diffuse toxic goiter or Basedow’s disease, an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system mistakenly stimulates the thyroid to produce too much thyroid hormone. Other causes of hyperthyroidism include thyroiditis, thyroid nodules and, rarely, certain medications and tumors.[1][2][3]","If left untreated for a long period of time, hyperthyroidism can lead to serious complications, including heart problems.[5] However, hyperthyroidism is relatively easy to diagnose with blood tests, and effective treatment options are available. These include medication, radioactive iodine therapy and, in some cases, surgery.[1][2][3]",Signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism,Symptoms of excess thyroid hormone may include:[1][2][3][6][7][8][9][10],Psychological symptoms,"
Anxiety or nervousness; some people may present with signs of depression

","Though not common, some people may experience weight gain due to increased appetite in hyperthyroidism. Some people may find that their appetite decreases.",Hyperthyroidism causes,"Hyperthyroidism has a number of possible causes, including the following:[1][2][3][5][10]",Graves' disease,"Also called Basedow’s disease or diffuse toxic goiter, this is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. It is an autoimmune condition in which the immune system mistakenly stimulates the thyroid gland to produce excess thyroid hormone. Graves' disease often runs in families and mainly affects young adult women, though it can occur in anyone, of any age.",Thyroid nodules,"A thyroid nodule is a small lump that develops in the thyroid gland. Sometimes, thyroid nodules cause the production of too much thyroid hormone; these are termed hot or toxic nodules. A single nodule is called toxic solitary adenoma and is typically found in people between 30 and 50 years of age.","If several nodules are present, it is called toxic multinodular goiter or Plummer disease – this is most commonly found in older adults. Nodules are made up of abnormal thyroid tissue, but they are not usually cancerous.",Thyroiditis,"Transient hyperthyroidism can also develop as a result of inflammation of the thyroid gland (thyroiditis), which may be part of various disorders, including De Quervain’s thyroiditis, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, silent thyroiditis and postpartum thyroiditis. For more information, see the Thyroiditis resource.",Medication,"Though unusual, hyperthyroidism can also be caused by certain medications, including amiodarone and lithium. Taking too many iodine supplements or over-the-counter formulations that contain thyroid hormones can also lead to hyperthyroidism in some cases.","If a person is taking levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, and the dose is too high, this too can cause symptoms of hyperthyroidism.",Other causes,A very small number of pregnant women may develop hyperthyroidism from hyperemesis gravidarum – a condition that causes severe nausea and vomiting during the first few months of pregnancy.[12],"Hyperthyroidism can also be caused by cancer in the thyroid gland or certain types of tumors. It can also occur, for a short period of time, after exposure to radiation, for example following treatment with radioiodine or radiotherapy.",Diagnosis of hyperthyroidism,"After taking the person’s medical history and performing a physical examination, a doctor will typically order blood tests to check thyroid hormone levels.",Blood tests for hyperthyroidism,These tests typically measure:[13],"
TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone)
FT4 (free thyroxine)
FT3 (free triiodothyronine) – only occasionally
","TSH levels vary according to the amount of T4 (thyroxine) that is needed. T4 is converted into T3 (triiodothyronine), the biologically active form of thyroid hormone. In hyperthyroidism, where there is an excess of thyroxine in the body, the level of TSH is usually low and the FT4 and FT3 high.[1][14]","If blood tests show normal levels of FT4 and FT3, but low TSH, a diagnosis of subclinical hyperthyroidism may be made and follow-up tests ordered for approximately two months’ time. In some cases, treatment may be recommended for persistent subclinical hyperthyroidism, particularly in older adults, as the condition may lead to complications.[10]","If the doctor suspects that Graves' disease may be present, they will usually also order blood tests to check for thyroid antibodies that are often seen in the disorder. If another cause is suspected, further blood tests may be necessary.[3][13]",Imaging tests,"In some cases, an ultrasound scan of the thyroid or a radioactive iodine uptake test with or without a procedure called a thyroid scan, may be recommended to confirm the diagnosis and cause of hyperthyroidism.[3] These imaging tests can detect thyroid nodules and inflammation, and provide insight into how the thyroid gland is functioning.",Thyroid ultrasound,This is a quick and simple scan that uses sound waves to create an image of the thyroid gland. No radioactive substances are involved.[15],Radioactive iodine uptake test and thyroid scan,"These tests require the administering of a small amount of a weak radioactive substance, which temporarily collects in the thyroid. Imaging is performed a number of hours later, either using a device called a gamma probe, or a radioactive iodine tracer in the case of a thyroid scan procedure.[16][17][18][19]",Differential diagnosis,"A doctor will need to rule out other conditions that can cause some of the same symptoms as hyperthyroidism, such as anxiety and panic disorder, diabetes, heart disease and drug abuse.[1]",Hyperthyroidism treatment,"If a person is diagnosed with hyperthyroidism they will usually be referred to an endocrinologist, a doctor specializing in the body’s hormones and hormonal conditions, for treatment.[10] The aims of treatment are to bring the levels of thyroid hormone into the acceptable range and manage any complications that may have arisen as a result of hyperthyroidism.[3]","There are a number of different treatment options. When advising which is most appropriate for a particular person, their age, general health, personal preferences and the cause of hyperthyroidism will be taken into account by the doctor. Treatment may include the following:[1][2][3][10][14]",Antithyroid medication,"A doctor may prescribe antithyroid medication to reduce the production of thyroid hormone. This is typically methimazole or carbimazole, or propylthiouracil if a person is in their first trimester of pregnancy. It may take a few weeks for thyroid hormone levels to stabilize, during which time beta-blockers or calcium-channel blockers may be recommended to alleviate hyperthyroidism symptoms like anxiety, palpitations and tremors.","The medication typically needs to be taken every day for a year to a year and a half. In some cases, it may then be possible to stop taking the antithyroid medication. However, some people will need to stay on it for life or consider another long-term treatment option.","A doctor will be able to advise on how long to take antithyroid medication, as well as precautions that need to be taken while on it. Antithyroid medication is typically not recommended for cases of transient hyperthyroidism caused by thyroiditis, as these tend to resolve on their own.",Radioiodine therapy,"In many cases of hyperthyroidism, radioactive iodine (radioiodine) therapy, also known as radioactive iodine ablation, may be recommended. A medical specialist will administer a single dose of radioactive iodine, typically in the form of a capsule or liquid. This iodine accumulates in the thyroid, gradually destroying thyroid tissue and decreasing the production of thyroid hormone. It may take a few months to see results.","If the therapy results in a complete, permanent lack of thyroid hormone production, which is often a desired outcome in the treatment of Graves' disease, it will be necessary to take synthetic thyroid hormone, levothyroxine, daily, to prevent the development of hypothyroidism. This is known as block-and-replace treatment.","It may be necessary to undergo short-term treatment with antithyroid medication prior to radioiodine therapy, particularly where symptoms are severe, the person is older or they have a heart condition. This treatment is typically stopped approximately a week before the radioiodine therapy is performed. Another short course of medication may be necessary after the procedure.","Radioiodine therapy is generally considered to be a safe and effective procedure that does not cause problems in the body. As a precaution, however, it is recommended that the person avoid prolonged close contact with others for a while after the treatment.","Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, people with severe Graves' ophthalmopathy and children under five years of age are not eligible for radioiodine therapy. Anyone planning to have a child is advised to wait for a certain period of time before trying to conceive afterwards. A doctor will be able to explain all necessary precautions in detail.",Thyroid surgery (thyroidectomy),"In some cases, doctors may recommend an operation to remove part or all of the thyroid gland (thyroidectomy). However, this is usually reserved for cases of hyperthyroidism where other types of treatment have been unsuccessful or intolerable, or a very large goiter (swelling of the gland) is causing problems, such as difficulty breathing.","A thyroidectomy is considered to be effective and safe. However, as with any type of surgery, there is a small risk of complications. Before having surgery, a person will typically be prescribed a course of antithyroid medication to minimize the risk of complications like thyroid storm (see below).","Depending on the amount of tissue that is removed, it will often be necessary to take synthetic thyroid hormone, levothyroxine, daily, to prevent the development of hypothyroidism.",Long-term management,"Regardless of the type of treatment a person receives, they will need to go for regular checkups afterwards. These will typically include blood tests to check that thyroid hormone levels are within range.","People with Graves' disease may experience periods of remission and relapse of hyperthyroidism. It is important to monitor for symptoms of hyperthyroidism, as well as hypothyroidism, such as sensitivity to cold, dry skin, fatigue and unexplained weight gain, and consult a doctor should any develop.",Natural remedies for hyperthyroidism,"While a number of over-the-counter products may claim to treat hyperthyroidism, there are currently no recognized natural remedies for the condition. If a person has symptoms of hyperthyroidism, it is important that they consult a medical doctor without delay.",Complications of hyperthyroidism,"If left untreated, or inadequately treated, hyperthyroidism can lead to a number of complications. These include:[1][3][10][20]",Thyroid eye disease,"A small number of people with hyperthyroidism develop related eye problems, termed thyroid eye disease. Because this is most commonly associated with Graves' disease, it is often called Graves' ophthalmopathy.","The eyes become inflamed and swollen, leading to pain and discomfort, and vision may be affected. Thyroid eye disease ranges from mild to severe, with treatment correspondingly differing from eye drops to medication and surgery. A person with thyroid eye disease will typically be referred to an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) for optimal management of the condition.[21][22]",Thyroid storm,"Rarely, a person with hyperthyroidism may develop a life-threatening condition, known as thyroid storm or thyrotoxic crisis.

Sugar is an important source of energy for the body. Symptoms of low blood sugar levels include headache, nervousness, shaking, concentration difficulties, sweating and nausea. The treatment of hypoglycemia is to give sugar, wether in food or drinks or, in severe cases, in fluid directly into the blood. Most people recover well, but severe hypoglycemia can be life-threatening and requires immediate treatment.",Risks,"Sugar is an important source of energy for the body, and the most important fuel for the brain. The body can partially compensate for low blood sugar levels, but eventually needs food in order to produce sugar quickly. Hypoglycemia can occur in anyone, though some people are more likely to have hypoglycemic episodes than others. People with diabetes who take medications to control their blood sugar levels, people who do not eat regularly and athletes may all be at risk of having a hypoglycemic episode, as are people with medical conditions which affect their liver and pancreas. In rare instances, a cancer that produces excess insulin can cause recurrent hypoglycemic episodes.",Symptoms,"The typical symptoms of hypoglycemia are headache, dizziness, impaired concentration, nervousness, irritability and uncoordinated movements. People with hypoglycemia may begin to sweat, shake and feel nauseous. They may also feel hungry. If severe hypoglycemia develops, the brain may not be able to work properly.

Typical symptoms are shivering, confusion, altered breathing rate and pulse, blue lips, fingers and toes. If treated promptly, most people recover well from hypothermia. Complications can include coma, brain damage and death.",Risks,"Hypothermia is typically caused by exposure to cold temperatures, when the body temperature drops faster than the body can produce heat to compensate (for example by remaining in the cold for too long without wearing appropriate clothing, and accidental falls in water etc.). People at an older or very young age, or ones with mental problems are at higher risk for hypothermia. Additionally, those under the influence of drugs or alcohol, or certain medical conditions (such as hypothyroidism, anorexia nervosa, etc.) are also at increased risk.",Symptoms,"Different stages of hypothermia produce different symptoms. Mild hypothermia causes shivering, dizziness, nausea, fast breathing and heart beat, nausea, and tiredness.

,,,,,,,,,,What is hypothyroidism?
,,,,,,,,,,What is hypothyroidism?,"Hypothyroidism refers to a condition in which the thyroid gland produces less hormone than normal. These hormones regulate the body's metabolism (turning food into energy and controlling the speed of cell growth). The condition can be congenital (present from birth), or occur later in life as a result of thyroid damage or conditions which cause inflammation or infection in the thyroid gland. See this resource for more information on congenital hypothyroidism.","Symptoms depend on the age of the person, but include tiredness, dry hair and skin, slowed thinking and weight gain. The treatment of this condition is replacement of the thyroid hormone with medication.",Risks,"The thyroid gland sits at the front of the throat, and produces a hormone (thyroid hormone) which controls metabolism (cell activity and growth). There are many causes for decreased thyroid gland function (hypothyroidism). These include not enough iodine in the diet, surgical or radiation damage to the thyroid gland, and infections or inflammation of the thyroid gland. Some children are born with a thyroid gland which does not work well. Hypothyroidism most commonly affects adults, though it can occur at any age. Both men and women are affected by the condition although it is more common in women. Some conditions that cause hypothyroidism tend to run in families, so people with a family member with hypothyroidism are often more likely to develop hypothyroidism.",Symptoms,"The early symptoms of poor thyroid function include tiredness, constipation, brittle nails, dry hair and feeling cold. As the hypothyroidism continues, people develop a low mood, decreased motivation, slowed thinking, weight gain, a slow heart rate and a hoarse voice. Some people may develop a lump in their thyroid gland or swelling of the neck. Babies with congenital hypothyroidism (hypothyroidism since birth) have feeding difficulties, prolonged newborn jaundice (yellow skin after birth), severe constipation, and tend to move less than other babies. These babies tend to not grow and develop at the same rate as other children.

,,,,,,,,,,What is ibuprofen?
,,,,,,,,,,What is ibuprofen?,"Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), with antipyretic (fever reducing) properties.[1] It may be taken by both adults and children to manage many commonplace conditions associated with pain and inflammation, such as toothache, headache, joint pain and menstrual cramps.[2][3]",Ibuprofen is an everyday painkiller which is used to:,"
Relieve mild to moderate pain
Reduce fever
Reduce swelling
",What is ibuprofen used for?,"Ibuprofen functions by inhibiting the synthesis, i.e. slowing down or blocking the production, of prostaglandins,[4] hormones that cause pain within the body. Prostaglandins also cause fever, swelling and inflammation. Ibuprofen is a popular and effective way to lessen these types of discomfort, which are associated with a wide variety of conditions. Feeling unwell? Get a free symptom assessment with the [Ada app]((https://app.adjust.com/e8ex7r4?redirect_macos=https%3A%2F%2Fappstore.com%2Fadapersonalhealthcompanion).",Ibuprofen can be used to treat:,"
Mild to moderate localized pain, as is typical of conditions like menstrual cramps, toothache and headache
Fevers, when the body’s temperature rises beyond its normal rating of around 37 degrees Celcius to 38 or more degrees Celsius
Pain and swelling from injuries such as sprains and strains
Redness and inflammation stemming from ongoing conditions such as osteoarthritis, a condition characterized by pain and stiffening in the joints
","Ibuprofen is not recommended for regular or long-term use without the supervision of a doctor, even in cases where pain is experienced on a long-term basis, as it has been linked to gastric discomfort and gastric conditions such as gastric or stomach ulcers and heart problems.","Anybody who is often or constantly taking ibuprofen should seek a medical opinion, as they may be suffering from an undiagnosed condition and/or may need to be prescribed alternative drugs that might be more suitable for long-term pain management.",Types of ibuprofen,"Ibuprofen can be purchased from most pharmacies and supermarkets as a prescription free over-the-counter medication. However, some types and strengths of ibuprofen are only available on prescription. These are usually prescribed for treating specific conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis.","Ibuprofen is available in various different forms, including:","
Oral products, such as tablets, liquids and capsules
Other formulations for oral consumption; i.e. in form of granules that can be dissolved in a hot drink
Topical products, for application on the skin, such as creams, gels and sprays
In products where it is combined with other active ingredients, including other pain medications, such as paracetamol
","Topical forms of ibuprofen tend to have fewer side-effects than oral ones. Therefore, in cases where ibuprofen is being used to treat an ongoing condition, e.g. pain related to a sporting injury, a locally applied topical form of ibuprofen ‒ such as a gel ‒ may be recommended.","Ibuprofen ingredients vary depending on the particular product used. In all ibuprofen products, the active ingredient, i.e. the element of the product which works as the painkiller, is ibuprofen itself, a white powder. Different products will contain different amounts of ibuprofen; oral products tend to come in dosage options of 200, 400, 600 or 800 mg.","In addition to the active ingredient ibuprofen and any other active ingredients that a given product may feature, such as paracetamol, painkilling products contain other ingredients, which do not treat pain or have any other medical use, but which give them their shape and/or consistency and taste, such as sucrose, lactose, glycerine, citric acid, and, in some cases, food colouring dyes. Always check the guidelines that come with the product for a complete list of ingredients, especially in the case of any known allergies or sensitivities.","Good to know: Like all pharmaceutical drugs, ibuprofen products will have an expiration date on their packaging. Research from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) suggests that, with some important exceptions like insulin and certain antibiotics, many pharmaceuticals retain most of their original potency after their expiration date.[5] However, in order to ensure that ibuprofen is safe and effective, medical guidelines recommend that any ibuprofen-containing products are taken within their expiry date.[6] Consuming expired meds also carries the risk that the shelf-life of the other ingredients in the product may be different to those of the active ingredients.",Ibuprofen vs aspirin,"Ibuprofen and aspirin are both over-the-counter (OTC), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Both types of painkiller work by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, thereby reducing pain and inflammation.The FDA considers both effective drugs to treat minor, i.e. mild to moderate aches and pains such as are associated with menstrual pain, toothache and headaches.","However, they can be used to treat a slightly different range of conditions and also differ somewhat in their side effects. Although both are linked to stomach upsets, aspirin is even more likely than ibuprofen to cause side effects related to the stomach, such as gastric ulcers.","Before taking any type of painkiller, always read the guidelines on the packet to ensure that it is suitable to treat the problem at hand. Seek medical advice on using the painkiller if in doubt, or if the pain or symptoms do not get better or go away as expected.",Ibuprofen vs paracetamol,"Paracetamol is also known as acetaminophen, and by the brand name TylenolⓇ in the U.S.[7] It is an analgetic (pain relieving) and antipyretic (fever reducing) painkiller, rather than an NSAID like ibuprofen and aspirin. As such, it relieves or reduces pain and fever, but not swelling or inflammation. This means that it is not a suitable alternative for treating swelling, for example, due to arthritis, or an injury.","Unlike NSAIDs, paracetamol is suitable for pregnant people and people using blood thinning medication, because it does not have the same anticoagulant (anti-clotting) effects on the blood.","Good to know: Despite some controversy, paracetamol is now considered not to be damaging to the stomach lining and will not, therefore, lead to ulcers. However, it may lead to stomach upsets, heartburn or nausea, especially in higher concentrations.[8][9][10]","High and/or frequent doses of paracetamol should be avoided, as this kind of use carries a risk of liver damage.[11]",Who can take ibuprofen?,"Ibuprofen is suitable for most adults, and children who are at least six months old. There are formulations and dosages available for babies older than 3 months and weighing more than 5 kgs, too, but they should not be given without consulting a doctor.","A doctor or pharmacist will be able to recommend the correct strength and formulation of ibuprofen for an individual’s needs, and the instructions on the packet will specify the correct dosage.",The appropriate dosage will depend on factors like:,"
The person’s age
The extent and type of pain they are experiencing
The recovery timeline of the condition that the ibuprofen is being used to treat
The strength and formulation of the product
",Ibuprofen is not suitable for certain people,"In rare cases, ibuprofen can cause heart attacks and strokes, particularly if it is used long-term or if a person takes high doses.[3] There are certain conditions and lifestyles which make this more likely, and which increase the risk of side-effects such as gastrointestinal damage.","It is not advisable for pregnant women to take ibuprofen, as it can affect the unborn child. In particular, it can compromise the development of the foetus and increases the risk that the newborn will develop asthma later on.[12]",Factors which increase the risk of complications arising from the use of ibuprofen include:[3],"
Heart disease
High cholesterol
Diabetes
Asthma
High blood pressure
A history of gastric/stomach ulcers
Certain arthritis and musculoskeletal diseases such as Sjorgen’s syndrome
Liver disease
Kidney disease

Asthma
Inflammatory bowel disease, such as Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis
Any conditions related to an increased risk of bleeding, such as haemophilia
Liver problems
Kidney problems
","Ibuprofen may react with other drugs in a way which impedes their function and/or causes an adverse reaction within the body, and it is advisable to investigate this before using ibuprofen if one is currently or regularly taking any other medications.","A person’s doctor will always be able to recommend a painkilling, and/or anti-inflammatory, alternative to ibuprofen, that is safe to use with other medications. It is never necessary, or advisable, to stop or miss a dose of one’s prescription medicine in order to use over-the-counter ibuprofen.",Some of the principal medications which are not recommended for use with ibuprofen without prior approval by your GP or healthcare provider include:[14],"
Other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as naproxen or high-dose aspirin
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), a type of antidepressant drugs
Drugs used to prevent blood clots, such as warfarin or heparin
Diuretics - medicines used to treat high blood pressure - and other heart medications like certain beta-blockers or digoxin

(For more information, see the FAQs.)",Drinking alcohol while taking ibuprofen,"Drinking alcohol with ibuprofen excessively is not recommended, as it may make irritation irritation of the stomach even more likely and, over time, increases the chances of gastric side effects, like stomach ulcers. Ibuprofen can also cause liver damage in some cases, especially if taken in higher dosages over prolonged amounts of time; combining it with alcohol increases this risk. Most cases of liver toxicity due to ibuprofen are of mild to moderate severity and can be reversed by discontinuing the use of ibuprofen.[15]",How to take ibuprofen,"Ibuprofen comes in many different oral and topical (to be applied on the skin) forms, so it is important to read the instructions that accompany the medication. The appropriate dosage depends on the strength and type of the ibuprofen and the age of the individual. The instructions will also explain how to store the ibuprofen. A cool, dry area is usually recommended,[16] but certain products may need to be refrigerated.",Ibuprofen should always be taken with or after food to avoid digestive discomfort.,The dosage guidelines vary between types of ibuprofen. Various OTC pain-relieving products may contain different strengths of ibuprofen. It is therefore vital to read the instructions associated with the particular type carefully before use and to note the maximum (max) dose suitable for the person taking the medicine.,"It is important to ensure that there are appropriate intervals between doses. The amount of time that must pass before it is safe to take more ibuprofen depends on the strength of the product. For example, an adult may take one or two 200mg tablets every four to six hours, but should not take more than 1,200mg (six 200mg) tablets over a 24-hour period, if self-medicating.[2]","If prescribed and recommended by a doctor, adults can take up to a maximum of 2400 mg to 3200 mg within a 24 hour period. Different maximal doses are recommended in different countries. Children will usually need to take a lower, age-dependent amount.",Ibuprofen: children’s dosage,Different types of ibuprofen are recommended for children of different ages:[13],"
Three months: Ibuprofen should only be given to infants of three months and older in syrup form and if approved by a doctor.
Six months and older: Ibuprofen in syrup form is most appropriate for children of six months and older. Until age six, children should not be given other forms of ibuprofen.
Six years and older: From the age of six, children can take ibuprofen in tablet or capsule form.
Seven years and older: From the age of seven, ibuprofen can be taken in form of chewable tablets.

",Ibuprofen side-effects,"NSAIDs like ibuprofen can increase the likelihood of internal bleeding and can irritate the stomach and the gut. This is because the prostaglandins play several key roles within the body. In addition to the negative properties that the NSAIDs inhibit, i.e. causing pain and inflammation, prostaglandins perform positive functions such as protecting the lining of the gut and helping facilitate coagulation (clotting of the blood).[17]",Common ibuprofen side-effects include:,"
Nausea and/or vomiting
Abdominal pain
Indigestion
Constipation
Bloating
Diarrhea
","Ibuprofen is also associated with some more serious, but less common, side-effects.",Less common ibuprofen side-effects include:,"
Dizziness
Drowsiness
Headaches
Allergic reactions, such as skin itching or a rash, up to severe allergic reactions that are an emergency
Gastric/stomach ulcers
Worsening of asthma symptoms
Kidney failure
Problems with the liver
Problems with the heart and circulation, for example, strokes and heart attacks
Internal bleeding, indicated by black stools and the presence of blood in one’s vomit
",The likelihood of experiencing side-effects from ibuprofen is increased by:,"
Taking more than the recommended dose
Taking ibuprofen at high doses for long periods of time
Taking ibuprofen with some of the drugs mentioned above, like corticosteroids
Being in poor general health
Being elderly
Having severe pre-existing kidney and/or liver diseases
","Anyone who experiences side-effects as a result of taking ibuprofen should seek a medical opinion in a timely manner, as both internal bleeding and complications arising from stomach and/or gut irritation can become life-threatening if left unchecked/untreated.",Ibuprofen overdose,"Most people can take up to 800mg of ibuprofen four times in a 24-hour period without the risk of overdosing.[3] However, overdoses of ibuprofen can be fatal, and symptoms of an overdose are not always seen immediately. For this reason, it is important and generally recommended to seek medical attention if a person has taken more than the maximum dose of ibuprofen recommended for their age and condition, especially when experiencing any of the symptoms below.",Symptoms of an overdose can include:,"
Vomiting
Nausea
Abdominal pain
Breathing difficulties
Reduced motor skills
Tinnitus (ringing in the ears)
",Ibuprofen FAQs,"Q: Can ibuprofen cause miscarriage?
A: Ibuprofen is not suitable for use at any point during a pregnancy, but the risks posed to the developing fetus are different, depending on how many weeks pregnant a person is. Before week 30 of pregnancy, ibuprofen may increase the risk of miscarriage. Research indicates that taking any type of NSAID, including ibuprofen, during pregnancy can more than double the risk of miscarriage, compared to avoiding this type of painkiller. A possible explanation for the link between NSAIDs and miscarriage is that they may compromise the mechanism by which prostaglandins are naturally blocked in the body during pregnancy, thus causing miscarriage.[18]","After week 30 of pregnancy, ibuprofen may cause the baby to develop a heart problem and may reduce the amount of amniotic fluid in the womb.[19]","Q: What medications can be used safely by pregnant people, instead of ibuprofen?
A: Paracetamol is the most suitable medication for pregnant people to use instead of ibuprofen. There is no evidence that paracetamol poses risks to a developing baby, and this medication can provide pain relief and/or reduce the symptoms of a fever, similar to the effects of ibuprofen. Pregnant people are recommended to take the lowest possible dose of paracetamol, for the shortest possible time.[20]","Good to know: Many OTC brands of paracetamol also contain caffeine. Excess caffeine intake should be avoided during pregnancy, so it is important to ensure that any paracetamol intended for use by a pregnant person is caffeine-free.[20]","Q: Is ibuprofen suitable to use when breastfeeding?
A: In general, ibuprofen is safe to use when breastfeeding, unless a person has asthma or a stomach ulcer which gets worse when they take ibuprofen. Only small amounts of ibuprofen are usually present in breast milk and these are not believed to cause harm to the baby. However, if a baby has a low birth weight, was born prematurely or has a medical condition, it is advisable to consult a doctor before using ibuprofen, as the traces in breast milk may be harmful in these cases.[21]","Q: Is it safe to drink alcohol at the same time as using ibuprofen?
A: Drinking alcohol excessively when taking any NSAID is likely to irritate the stomach. Drinking a moderate amount of alcohol is not thought to have an impact on the safety or effectiveness of taking ibuprofen, provided a person is over 21 years of age, is not pregnant and is not affected by any long-term health conditions. The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that women drink no more than one drink per day and that men drink no more than two drinks per day.[22]","Q: Does ibuprofen reduce swelling?
A: Yes. Ibuprofen works by blocking the production of prostaglandins, which the body produces in response to illness and/or injury, and which cause pain, inflammation, fever and swelling. Although ibuprofen can temporarily reduce swelling, the root cause of the illness or injury may need to be addressed before the body stops producing the swelling. For example, ibuprofen may temporarily relieve the pain and swelling associated with dental abscess, but, in almost all dental abscess cases, a visit to the dentist may be required in order to treat the problem fully and prevent further pain and swelling developing at the site of the problem.[23]","Q: Is ibuprofen a blood thinner?
A: Ibuprofen is not designed to be used as a blood thinning medication. However, like other NSAIDs, it interferes with the way that platelets work, and thus can make the body’s blood clotting abilities less efficient than normal. For this reason, ibuprofen is often described as a blood thinner. Ibuprofen is not recommended for use with actual blood thinners, i.e. antiplatelet drugs or anticoagulants, because of this property. It is recommended that people who are using prescription blood thinners and who need to use painkillers opt for paracetamol, rather than ibuprofen or aspirin, to avoid interactions related to blood thinning. However, anybody who is on a course of blood thinning medication should only use painkillers according to their doctors recommendations, with caution, and in the lowest possible dose.[24]","Q: Is it bad to take ibuprofen every day?
A: Yes. Ibuprofen is only recommended for short-term use; as long-term or regular use, it is linked to an increased likelihood of experiencing harmful side effects, such as stomach ulcers and heart problems. Seek a medical opinion if you need to use a painkiller for long-term pain management, so a doctor can find the best way to help you, and, if necessary, prescribe a safe alternative. Feeling unwell?

A: Yes, it is safe to consume grapefruit when taking ibuprofen. However, it is always advisable to check whether any medication, including other pain-relief and anti-inflammatory medication, will perform differently in the body when grapefruit is consumed. Grapefruit, especially grapefruit juice, contains particular chemicals which can alter the way the body metabolizes (breaks down) some medications, resulting in more, or, in some cases, less, than the required quantity of a given drug entering a person’s bloodstream. All OTC medications come with a “Drug Facts” label which will mention whether there is any cross-reactivity with grapefruit.[25]"
,,,,,,,,,,What is impetigo?
,,,,,,,,,,What is impetigo?,"Impetigo, or school sores, is a bacterial infection of the skin. It is caused by Staphylococcal or Streptococcal bacteria. It is a relatively common infection, and most commonly affects school-aged children. It is easily spread by skin-to-skin contact, or via objects touched by someone with the infection. It causes itchy, painless bumps or sores which become blisters and burst, leaving a light brown crust. It may take several weeks to clear but antibiotics shorten the time taken to heal and reduce the spread of the bacteria. With appropriate treatment, most people recover well.",Risks,"Impetigo occurs when bacteria which normally live on the body get into small breaks in the skin and begin to overgrow. These bacteria are normally Staphylococcal and Streptococcal bacteria, which also cause other medical conditions, such as tonsillitis, boils and wound infections. This condition can affect people of all ages, although it most commonly affects children. Impetigo is most common in the warm months of the year, and in places with poor access to health care.",Symptoms,"Impetigo begins as a red bump. This may occur on the face, arms, legs, trunk or buttocks. These bumps may develop to a blister or an open sore, which forms a yellow-brown crust. The sores are itchy but painless.",Diagnosis,Diagnosis is usually based on the appearance of the sores. The diagnosis can be confirmed by investigating fluid from as the sores for Staphylococcal or Streptococcal bacteria.,Treatment,"School sores are treated by keeping the sores clean. This can be done using low-irritant soaps and antiseptic lotions, such as lotions containing iodine, along with antibiotic creams. Sores should be kept covered if possible. If there is a widespread infection, antibiotic tablets may be needed.",Prevention,"People with impetigo should stay home from daycare, school or work until the sores form a crust or they have had 24hrs of antibiotic treatment. Sore should be covered when returning to school or work. Maintaining good hygiene measures, such as washing hands, bed clothes and objects used by the affected person, can help to prevent spreading the infection.",Other names for impetigo,"

,,,,,,,,,,What is infantile atopic dermatitis?,"Infantile atopic dermatitis, often called atopic dermatitis, atopic eczema or baby eczema, is a very common skin condition in children. People with this condition suffer dermatitis (inflammation of the skin) due to allergies or having skin which is sensitive to certain substances. It tends to affect children before they turn five. The typical symptoms are a red, itchy rash and scaly, dry skin. These symptoms tend to flare (get worse) in response to certain triggers. Treatment involves keeping the skin moist and using creams or medications to soothe the skin and treat the inflammation. Many children with atopic dermatitis will find that their condition improves over time, and may not have any symptoms by the time they are teenagers.",Risks,"Infantile atopic dermatitis is a very common condition. Atopic eczema usually occurs before the age of five, and often occurs for the first time before a child's first birthday. Children with allergies (including hay fever and allergic asthma), or who have parents with these conditions, tend to have a higher chance of having atopic eczema. Factors that trigger atopic eczema can be dryness, heat and sweating, irritating substances (such as certain clothing or chemicals), emotional or physical stress, skin infections and allergens, often food.",Symptoms,"The typical symptoms of eczema are an red, itchy rash and scaly, dry skin. This rash might ooze or weep, and the skin may be raw due to persistent scratching. This rash often affects the face, scalp, elbows and knees.

,,,,,,,,,,What is infantile colic?
,,,,,,,,,,What is infantile colic?,"Infantile colic is a condition, in which an otherwise healthy baby cries excessively, frequently and at an abnormally high pitch. These crying episodes, which often occur in the evening, are the most typical symptom. Colicky babies may also be inconsolable during a crying episode.","A physician should exclude any other cause for the excessive crying in order to confirm the diagnosis of infantile colic. Laboratory tests are not usually necessary, unless there is reason to suspect that the crying is caused by an underlying medical condition.[1]","Generally, the condition tends to resolve on its own, with no long-term complications. Studies suggest that up to 40 percent of all newborns and infants experience infantile colic at some point.[2]",Infantile colic symptoms,"The most typical symptom of infantile colic is episodes of high-pitched, excessive crying, which often occur during the evening hours. Colicky crying is often described as more high-pitched and strained than ordinary crying[1].",The rule of three is often used to determine whether the excessive crying is the result of colic. Colicky babies may cry for:[2],"
Three or more hours a day
Three or more days a week
Three or more weeks
","Not all babies with colic will necessarily follow this pattern. If a parent is unsure of whether the crying is colic or not, they should consult their baby’s doctor or nurse.","Good to know: Colicky crying is still within the normal range of infant crying. Most infants cry more in the afternoon and evening, with their tendency to cry peaking at around six weeks of age. The difference between normal crying and colicky crying is that babies with colic cry for longer than babies without, and are much harder to soothe.[2]",Babies with colic may show distinctive behaviour while crying. They may:[2][1],"
Grimace or scowl
Furrow their brows
Draw their legs up to their belly
Clench fists
Flush
Stiffen
","The infants are usually otherwise healthy babies, with a normal appetite and normal weight gain.","However, some behaviours that are associated with crying, but are not part of normal crying, may indicate an undiagnosed cardiopulmonary disorder. These include:[2]","
Apnea, a temporary pause in breathing during sleep, or struggling to breath
Cyanosis, a bluish colour in the skin or mucus membranes that indicates low oxygen levels in the blood
Fever

Begin a free symptoms assessment in the Ada app now.,Causes of infantile colic,"The causes of infantile colic are largely unknown. However, colic may be the result of physical, social and/or environmental factors that may be out of the parents’ control. These include:[2][1][3]","
An imbalance in the infant’s gut microflora
Overfeeding or underfeeding
Food allergies, including allergy to milk proteins and lactose intolerance
Incomplete burping after feeding
Exposure to cigarette smoke or metabolites of cigarette smoke
Parental stress or anxiety
",There is some evidence that colic is more common in infants whose mothers have had postpartum depression.[1] It is known that babies respond to parental anxiety. Lactose intolerance is a relatively rare cause of colic. There is some evidence that breastfed infants are less likely to have infantile colic.[4],There is no evidence that fermentation in the colon causes colic.[1],Risk factors,"Infantile colic is commonly observed in newborns between the ages of two weeks and four months, with the condition typically peaking at around six weeks of age. It is equally frequent in both male and female infants.","Good to know: If a toddler is exhibiting colicky symptoms, it is unlikely to be colic. The child should be examined by a pediatrician, and other causes for excessive crying should be investigated.","If your child is feeling unwell, you can check the symptoms via a personal health assessment in the Ada app.",Diagnosis of infantile colic,"To confirm the diagnosis, other causes for the crying should always be excluded first. Infantile colic is often defined by rule of three: crying for more than three hours per day, for more than three days per week and for longer than three weeks, in an infant who is well-fed and otherwise healthy. However, other things that the doctor will take into account are:[5]","
The age of the baby at the onset of symptoms of colic
How the parents respond to the crying
How intense the crying is
How the child is fed, including what position the baby is in, whether it is burped, and whether it is bottle fed or breastfed
","If the baby is being bottle fed, the type of milk and the type of teat used will also be examined. If the baby is being breastfed, the doctor may also ask about her diet.",Laboratory tests are usually not needed. Physicians will take note of the baby’s family situation and their medical history. They will also take a history of the baby’s feeding and diet patterns in order to rule out gastroesophageal disorders such as gastroesophagael reflux disease (GERD) and allergies.[2],"To rule out urinary tract infections or other infections, the baby’s patterns of defecation, urination and sleeping will also be reviewed. If there is any history of fever, vomiting or trauma, this should be noted because it may be relevant.[5]",Doctors who are examining a baby who is suspected of having colic will also routinely check for:,"
Fractures, cuts, scrapes or bruises
Hairs or fibres wrapped around fingers or toes
Skin irritation and diaper rash
",Infantile colic treatment,"Since the causes of the condition are largely unknown, treatment options are limited. As the condition does not cause serious problems, parents are advised to develop techniques to help the infant to stop crying, such as singing, swaddling or holding the infant.",It is also important to make sure that the baby is in an upright position during feeding. Changes in feeding habits or diet are usually not recommended.,Parental reassurance and stress management,One of the most important elements of treatment for infantile colic is keeping the parents calm and to reassure them that the condition is temporary and that their baby is generally healthy.[2],"Colic is distressing for babies and their caregivers, and colicky babies are at increased risk of being shaken and injured,[3] as parents may become frustrated that they cannot calm or console the baby during a crying episode.","Because colicky babies cannot be soothed, caregivers may set the baby down in a safe place, such as their cot, to cry unattended for a short while. This is acceptable, as long as the baby is not cold, wet, unwell, hungry or too hot,[3], and as long as the baby is not left alone for very long.","Because colicky crying also occurs most often in the evening, parents may also experience some sleep loss, which can contribute to feelings of frustration and stress. Parents should take care to ensure that they are rested, possibly by taking it in turns to attend to the baby. It is also acceptable to leave the baby with other competent caregivers for short periods of time, in order for parents to rest.[3]",Good to know: Colicky babies should not be left unattended for long periods of time.,"Drugs, medication and dietary modifications for colic","Medication is not usually very useful in treating colic. In some cases, if the mother is breastfeeding the infant, colic can be alleviated by excluding some foods from the mother’s diet. These include:[1]","
Cow’s milk and dairy products
Eggs
Wheat
Nuts
Spice and garlic
Caffeine
Alcohol
",Eliminating these foods will not necessarily help relieve infantile colic in all cases.,"If the cause of the colicky crying is suspected to be an allergy to cow’s milk, a low-lactose formula or lactase drops, which are added to milk, may be recommended. Soy-based formulas are not very often recommended for colicky babies.[1] However, lactose intolerance is relatively rare.","Good to know: Spinal manipulation, while occasionally said to relieve colic, is unsafe for babies and should not be considered as a treatment option. Likewise, sedatives such as phenobarbital and chloral hydrate are unsafe for babies and should not be used in the treatment of colic.",Gripe water,"Gripe water[6] is a traditional remedy for colic, and while there is anecdotal evidence that it works, no formal reviews have ever proven that it is helpful. Many brands of gripe water contain alcohol, dill oil, an alkalinizing agent, such as bicarbonate of soda, and sugar. In many countries, the composition of gripe water is not regulated. Gripe water may also cause constipation.","Alcohol is unsafe for babies, while dill oil may only be of help in cases where excess gas is a cause of pain. Bicarbonate of soda is not thought to be helpful, as stomach acid is not the cause of colic.","There is some evidence that administering an oral sweet solution of sugar to babies does help to relieve pain, and this is probably the basis for the success of gripe water in relieving colic, as the sweetness itself is soothing. However, in this case, it is better to consult a doctor about using a simple oral glucose solution rather than gripe water.",Other names for infantile colic,"

,,,,,,,,,,What is infective endocarditis?
,,,,,,,,,,What is infective endocarditis?,"Infective endocarditis is an infection of the inner lining of the heart and the heart valves with bacteria or, less commonly, a fungus. People at risk of this condition are people who have had a procedure involving their blood vessels, people who have had heart valve problems in the past, and people who use IV drugs. Symptoms can be unspecific, and include fever, weakness, a loss of appetite, sweating, shortness of breath and swelling of the feet. Diagnosis is sometimes difficult and has to fulfill certain criteria, such as evidence of the bug causing the infection in several blood samples. Intravenous antibiotic treatment (through a drip) over several weeks is needed to completely treat the infection. Even with appropriate treatment this condition can be life-threatening.",Risks,"Bacteria or fungi can enter the bloodstream through small injuries (such as during the cleaning of the teeth), when injecting into the veins, during surgeries, or during other infections. If bacteria or fungi reach the heart, they may can settle on the endocardium (the inner lining of the heart or the heart valves), and begin to grow, causing an infection. The infection causes swelling, scarring and damage to the heart lining and valves. Heart valves that are already damaged and artificial heart valves provide a good environment for these infections, and people with these conditions are at especial risk of developing infective endocarditis. Other risk factors include intravenous drug use, having device in place to keep a vein open, or undergoing another procedure that requires accessing the veins. This condition can affect people of all ages, but most commonly affects younger adults.",Symptoms,"The symptoms of infective endocarditis may begin slowly and be vague in the early stages. General symptoms include nausea, a fast pulse, a feeling of weakness, weight loss, sweating and joint pain. People with infective endocarditis may have a fever that comes and goes. Small red spots under the nails, on the palms or the soles may be visible. Other symptoms may occur if organs are damaged, and this is may be different from person to person. Some people may develop a cough, become slowly more short of breath, or develop swelling of the feet and legs.",Diagnosis,"Diagnosis is based on the symptoms, physical examination and certain diagnostic tests. Making the diagnosis can be difficult and has to fulfill specific criteria. These tests include blood tests to try and identify the cause of the infection. An ultrasound of the heart may show a growth on the heart valve, and any damage to the valves. Further diagnostic tests can be done to investigate for involvement of other organs.",Treatment,"Treatment involves intravenous (through a drip) antibiotics over several weeks. If there is damage to the heart valves, surgical replacement of the damaged valves may be necessary.",Prevention,Using sterile techniques when injecting into the veins is important to prevent bacteria and fungi from entering the bloodstream. This may involve maintaining high standards of hygiene in the hospital setting and treating infections helps to prevent endocarditis. People who have a high risk of infective endocarditis may need to take antibiotics in certain situations to prevent developing this condition.,Other names for infective endocarditis,"

,,,,,,,,,,What is an influenza infection?,"An influenza infection, or the flu, is a common viral infection of the airways that most commonly occurs in fall and winter. The influenza virus is spread in droplets from the mouth and nose, which can be sent into the air while sneezing or coughing, or passed by sharing crockery or cutlery. People who are older than 65 or who have other medical conditions tend to get the flu more commonly, and are at risk of developing a severe flu. This condition causes fever, cough, a runny nose and muscle aches and pains. In most cases, no specific treatment is needed, and people get better within a week. In rare cases, influenza can cause a severe infection, and this condition can become life-threatening.",Risks,"The flu is caused by an influenza virus. The virus causes short-lived inflammation in the throat and nose. The influenza virus is spread in droplets from the mouth and nose, which can be sent into the air while sneezing or coughing, or passed by sharing crockery or cutlery. Most infections occur in the fall and winter months. Infants and individuals over the age of 65 tend to have the flu most commonly. People with a weakened immune system or who have other long-term medical conditions are also at higher risk of catching the flu.",Symptoms,"The typical symptoms of the flu include fever, coughing, a sore throat, runny nose, muscle and joint pain, and feeling generally unwell. The lymph glands in the throat may be bigger than usual. Symptoms of a severe infection which may need emergency treatment are shortness of breath, wheezing and breathing difficulties.",Diagnosis,"Diagnosis is made based on the symptoms and the physical examination. If the diagnosis is uncertain, or the symptoms are severe, a sample of mucus from the throat or nose is taken and tested for the virus.",Treatment,"In most cases, no specific treatment is needed. People with the flu should stay home from school or work, rest and take plenty of fluids. Drinking warm drinks or using lozenge may help soothe a sore throat. Paracetamol or ibuprofen can help relieve the headache and muscle aches. If the runny nose is bothersome, decongestant sprays or tablets may be helpful. If the infection is severe, there are some anti-viral medications which target flu, but these make little difference to recovery in people with mild or moderate symptoms.",Prevention,"Keeping up good hygiene when sick, such as washing hands regularly and staying home while unwell, are important to prevent spreading the influenza virus.

,,,,,,,,,,What is inguinal hernia?
,,,,,,,,,,What is inguinal hernia?,"An inguinal hernia occurs when the intestine pokes through a hole in the abdominal wall in the groin area. Inguinal hernias are relatively common. This condition mostly affects older men. The most common symptom of an inguinal hernia is a lump in the groin area, which may go away temporarily when pushed on. The diagnosis is made by a doctor examining the lump and examining the lump with an ultrasound scan of the area. As untreated hernias can sometimes cause bowel to become trapped and die, the hole in the abdominal wall is often repaired surgically. A trapped hernia is an emergency and needs urgent treatment. Surgical treatment usually works well to cure this condition.",Risks,"A hernia occurs when a an organ, most commonly intestine, moves into a part of the body where it doesn't normally belong. An inguinal hernia occurs when the intestine pokes through a hole in the abdominal wall in the groin region. This hole can occur during development before birth, or can develop over time due to age, injury or muscle weakness. Things that increase the pressure inside the abdomen can increase the risk of this condition, such as being obese, having a persistent cough, straining when opening the bowel or heavy lifting. Inguinal hernias are common. This condition is much more common among men, and tends to affect older people.",Symptoms,"Typical symptoms include a bulge in the groin area or scrotum. This lump may be uncomfortable or painful, especially when exercising. It may be possible to reduce the bulge by pushing on it, but it will eventually come back.",Diagnosis,The diagnosis is usually made via the physical examination. Ultrasound of the area helps to confirm diagnosis.,Treatment,Treatment involves repairing the hole in the abdominal wall at surgery. One option involves placing a mesh over in the groin area to cover and support the hole which causes the hernia. This is usually done laparoscopically (with keyhole surgery).,Prevention,"Avoiding activities that cause increased pressure in the abdomen, such as straining when opening the bowel or lifting heavy loads, can help to prevent an inguinal hernia, or prevent an existing hernia from getting bigger.",Other names for inguinal hernia,"

,,,,,,,,,,What is iron deficiency?
,,,,,,,,,,What is iron deficiency?,"Iron deficiency refers to inadequate levels of the mineral iron in the body. The term is commonly used interchangeably with anemia: a condition often caused by iron deficiency, where the body either cannot produce a sufficient number of healthy red blood cells, or enough of the protein (hemoglobin) that allows red blood cells to carry oxygen around the body.","However, health problems may arise before iron levels drop to the extent that anemia develops. For this reason, the terms “iron depletion” and “non-anemic iron deficiency” are sometimes also used.[1]","Iron is a micronutrient that is vital for the healthy functioning of the body. It is an important part of the production of red blood cells, skin, hair, nails, muscles and hormones. Iron also plays a key role in the functioning of nerve cells.[2]","For many people, a balanced and varied diet provides all the iron they need. Good sources of iron include liver, meat, beans, nuts, whole grains, fortified breakfast cereals and dark-green leafy vegetables.[3]","However, iron deficiency is very common in both developing and developed countries, making it the most widespread nutritional disorder in the world.[4] Groups of people who are particularly at risk of developing iron deficiency include pregnant women, premenopausal women, infants, children, teenagers and the elderly.[1][5]","Iron deficiency may be the result of a number of different factors and conditions. Some of the most common causes of iron deficiency are inadequate dietary intake, continuous blood loss, increased need and inadequate absorption.[1][5]","Symptoms of iron deficiency do not always manifest until iron-deficiency anemia develops, but may include fatigue; paleness; dizziness; an inability to concentrate and diminished productivity; unhealthy nails, skin and hair and a painful tongue, among others.[1][5]","If left untreated, iron-deficiency anemia can have serious consequences, including increased susceptibility to illness and infection,[6] pregnancy complications, impaired cognitive and physical development, heart failure[7] and increased risk of morbidity in children.[4] However, iron deficiency is generally fairly easy to treat by addressing underlying conditions, making dietary modifications and taking supplements where necessary.[1][4][5]",Iron deficiency symptoms,"Tiredness and a reduced ability to exercise may be experienced before anemia develops.[8] However, signs of low iron may not be noticeable in many people until the deficiency has advanced to anemia.[1] Even then, some people may present with few or no symptoms.[6][8] The severity of the symptoms typically depends on how rapidly anemia develops and the extent of the deficiency.[6][9]",People experiencing possible symptoms of iron deficiency can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.,Main symptoms,"Where present, some of the more common symptoms of iron deficiency may include:[7][10][6]","
Fatigue
Difficulty concentrating on work or studies

Changes in sense of taste
Chest pain (usually in people where there is pre-existing heart disease)
Craving or eating clay, chalk, coal, ice, paper or other non-food substances (Pica syndrome)
Difficulty swallowing (very rare)
","Many of the symptoms of iron deficiency are nonspecific and may be indicative of other conditions.[12][10] In addition, there are a number of different types of anemia, all of which require different treatments. For this reason, it is important to consult with a medical practitioner should any of the above symptoms present.",Causes of iron deficiency,"There are a number of possible causes of iron deficiency (which may lead to iron-deficiency anemia). Many of these involve different types of blood loss, which equates to the loss of cells that contain iron. An iron deficiency can result as a consequence.",Causes of iron deficiency include:[7][8][9],"
Dietary deficiency. A diet that is lacking in iron can lead to iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia. This is more common in developing countries and people who follow very restrictive diets.
Menstruation. Women with heavy menstrual periods may develop iron deficiency if the amount of iron in their diet is insufficient to replace that lost during their periods.
Pregnancy. Women who are pregnant require more iron than usual, and anemia often results when the levels in their diet are insufficient to support both their needs and those of the baby.
Bleeding from the gut. Certain conditions can cause bleeding from the stomach and intestines. These include stomach or duodenal ulcers, inflammation of the large intestine or oesophagus, hemorrhoids and bowel cancer, among others. Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) like aspirin and ibuprofen can also sometimes cause bleeding.
Bleeding from the kidneys. Certain conditions that affect the kidneys and bladder can cause bleeding and subsequent iron loss.
Impaired absorption. Certain health conditions can impede absorption of iron from the gut. These conditions include celiac disease, infections with the bacteria Helicobacter pylori (H.pylori),[8] and inflammatory bowel disease, among others. Gastric surgery may also lead to impaired absorption of iron.
Parasitic infection. Hookworm infection can result in chronic blood loss and is a major cause of iron deficiency worldwide. Those living in or traveling to certain tropical countries are particularly at risk.
Malaria. A relationship exists between malaria and iron deficiency in tropical parts of the world.
","Other possible causes of iron deficiency include blood loss from surgery, chronic inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis,[1] cancer and overtraining in athletes.[8] Diets very high in substances that interfere with iron absorption (for example, dairy, tea and phytates) may also be implicated in the development of iron deficiency.[1][7] Heavy nosebleeds and blood donation can also lead to iron deficiency, though these potential causes may be overlooked by healthcare practitioners.[9]",Risk factors,"Anemia means that the body doesn’t have enough healthy red blood cells and hemoglobin to transport oxygen around the body. Iron-deficiency anemia is caused due to lack of iron and hemoglobin, which are needed for binding oxygen to the red blood cells.",This condition may develop when the body does not have enough iron to make red blood cells. This condition often occurs after someone loses large amounts of blood or during pregnancy when the body needs more iron than normal. It can also occur slowly over time if a person can’t or doesn’t take in enough iron. Iron deficiency is one of the most common causes of anemia. This condition is most common in women of childbearing age.,Diagnosis of iron deficiency,"After taking the person’s medical history and performing a physical examination, a doctor will typically request blood tests to confirm the diagnosis of iron deficiency.[13]","A blood test called a full blood count (FBC) is used to examine the number and size of the red blood cells and the amount of haemoglobin (the iron-containing molecule) in the red blood cells. The results of this test will generally indicate whether the person has anemia and what kind of anemia it may be. This can help the doctor to identify possible causes. However, because there are multiple different types and causes of anemia, further tests may be required.[7]","Other blood tests may be ordered to check the levels of ferritin in the blood – this usually provides a good indication of the total iron stores in the body. Low ferritin levels typically indicate iron deficiency. However, the results may be unreliable if there is any infection or inflammation, as well as in cases where heart failure, liver disease, cancer or hyperthyroidism is present, as these conditions may be accompanied by unusual ferritin levels.[1][7]","If the cause of the iron deficiency is not clear, the doctor may recommend one or more of the following diagnostic tests:[7]","
Fecal (stool) tests and a rectal exam to check for health conditions that may be contributing to the deficiency
An endoscopy to examine the state of the stomach and intestines
A colonoscopy to examine the state of the bowel and rectum
An abdominal computed tomography or CT scan
Blood tests and sometimes a gut biopsy (where a small piece of the small intestine is removed and sent for tests) for celiac disease
Blood tests to assess thyroid, liver and kidney function
Bone marrow biopsy (where a small portion of bone marrow is removed and sent for tests)
","The doctor may need to differentiate the diagnosis of iron deficiency from other conditions that can cause many of the same symptoms, such as thyroid disorders.[7] People experiencing symptoms that may be linked to iron deficiency or a related condition can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.",Prevention of iron deficiency,"While it is not always possible to prevent iron deficiency, people can take steps to reduce their risk of developing the condition. These include:[1]","
Eating a diet that contains iron-rich foods
Avoiding excessive consumption of substances that can interfere with iron absorption (such as tea, coffee and cow’s milk)
Taking precautions to prevent malaria when traveling to regions where the disease is prevalent
Regular screening where there is a high risk of iron deficiency
","It is not advisable to take iron supplements unless an iron deficiency has been confirmed by a medical practitioner, as taking more iron than needed can cause side-effects and interfere with the absorption of other important minerals. Too much iron can be toxic.[5]",Iron deficiency treatment,"Treatment for iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia typically involves addressing the underlying cause, increasing the amount of iron in the diet and sometimes taking iron supplements. Both liquid and tablet iron supplements are available; a doctor will advise on the type and dosage required. The length of time a person needs to take an iron supplement will depend on the severity of the iron deficiency.[7]","Commonly prescribed iron supplements include ferrous sulfate, ferrous fumarate and ferrous gluconate – all of which are equally effective.[11] All iron supplements can be toxic in high doses, and should be kept out of reach of children.","Iron supplements may cause unpleasant side-effects, including nausea, stomach pain, heartburn, diarrhea and constipation.[11] Taking lower doses or taking the supplement with meals can help to reduce the likelihood and severity of these side-effects.[2] A doctor may advise taking the iron supplement with orange juice or vitamin C to enhance absorption of the mineral.[13]","Not all cases of iron deficiency will require treatment with a medical supplement. If the deficiency is mild, it may be sufficient to take a natural supplement like a highly concentrated juice made from plants that are rich in iron. Some people may find this kind of supplement more palatable and easier to take on a regular basis.","A person with iron deficiency will typically start to feel better within a few days of starting their treatment program.[8] They will usually be asked to have follow-up blood tests a few weeks later to confirm that the treatment is working. Even after their iron levels have returned to the normal range, the treatment will usually continue for another three months or more, and the person will be asked to have regular blood tests to ensure that they do not develop iron deficiency again.[7]","Unless the iron deficiency is related to a serious underlying health condition, the treatment is usually effective.[6]",Iron deficiency FAQs,"Q: Can iron deficiency cause hair loss?
A: Yes, iron deficiency can cause hair loss. The condition can also result in the hair, skin and nails appearing in a poor condition.[1]","Q: Are vegetarians at greater risk of iron deficiency?
A: While iron found in some plant sources can be difficult to absorb, eating a well-balanced vegetarian diet is generally sufficient to prevent deficiency. The incidence of iron-deficiency anemia in vegetarians has not been found to differ greatly from non-vegetarians. However, poor or restrictive vegetarian diets may increase the risk of developing iron-deficiency anemia.[14] It is recommended that those following a vegan diet – young women in particular – have their iron status checked regularly and take supplements where necessary.[15]","Q: What is latent iron deficiency?
A: Also known as depleted iron stores, latent iron deficiency refers to a lack of iron that may not be severe enough to cause anemia, but could cause other health problems.[1]"
,,,,,,,,,,What is irritable bowel syndrome?
,,,,,,,,,,What is irritable bowel syndrome?,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder affecting bowel function, characterized by symptoms mostly relating to digestive discomfort, including diarrhea, constipation, bloating, gas, cramping, and abdominal pain. IBS affects around 11 % of the population globally. In western countries, such as the U.S., women are significantly more likely to be affected by IBS than men, but this ratio varies dramatically around the world; in India, for example, between 80 and 90 percent of those affected are male. People who have a family history of irritable bowel syndrome are more likely to develop the condition than those who do not.[1]","Different people will experience different combinations of the possible symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), thus requiring varying treatments. Diagnosis of IBS will involve identifying triggers of its symptoms, which are usually gastrointestinal and related to a person’s diet and lifestyle, so that a person’s exposure to triggers that activate irritable bowel syndrome can be minimised as part of their treatment plan.","IBS can be a long-term condition requiring careful management. The improvement of a person’s digestive health is often brought about by a combination of lifestyle and diet changes designed to reduce instances of bloating, constipation, diarrhea and other symptoms they may be experiencing. Changes to a person’s diet may involve adopting a low FODMAP diet; a diet low in fermentable short-chain carbohydrates. (See the “Treatment” section of this resource for more information about FODMAP foods.) Pharmaceutical interventions may be used to treat chronic (persistent) cases of IBS.","Irritable bowel syndrome does not cause inflammation or permanent damage such as bleeding or ulcers, nor an increased risk of cancers.",Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) vs. inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),"Both IBS and IBD are conditions which affect the gastrointestinal tract, which is part of the digestive system. Though the symptoms of IBS and IBD can be similar, including abdominal pain, bloating, constipation, diarrhea and abdominal cramping, IBD is a more serious condition.","Inflammatory bowel diseases are a group of conditions in which the body’s own immune system attacks parts of the digestive system in the gastrointestinal tract. This group includes chronic diseases such as ulcerative colitis, which affects the large intestine, and Crohn’s disease, which can affect the entire digestive tract, damaging both the surface and the deep tissues of the intestines.[2]","In contrast, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) only affects the function and behaviour of the intestines. IBS is not an autoimmune condition. Although IBD does not cause IBS, those affected by IBD have a greater likelihood of developing the !BS than the general population. In contrast, having IBS has no impact on a person’s likelihood of developing IBD.[2]",Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms,"Different kinds of IBS are diagnosed according to their symptoms, with people experiencing different combinations of the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, including bloating, diarrhea, constipation and painful abdominal cramps.","Diarrhea and constipation may each affect people with IBS on their own, together, or in alternating periods.",Common symptoms include:[3],Abdominal pain and cramping,"Abdominal pain and cramping, particularly felt in the lower belly, is one of the most common symptoms of IBS. Abdominal cramps can be caused by constipation or diarrhea, other symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. They typically increase after meals. For some people affected by IBS, having a bowel movement (BM) can intensify pain and cramping; for others, having a BM can reduce these symptoms.",Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with predominant diarrhea,"Some people experience diarrhea as a main symptom of irritable bowel syndrome, passing loose, watery stools more than three times per day. In people with IBS, diarrhea may occur suddenly, particularly after encountering triggers of their symptoms. In cases of irritable bowel syndrome in which a person experiences diarrhea as one of their most prominent symptoms, the condition is sometimes called IBS-D. Altering a person’s diet is the first-line treatment for IBS-D, followed by prescribing medications.[4]",Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with predominant constipation,"Those experiencing constipation as a symptom of IBS may pass fewer than three
bowel movements per week. When it is passed, stool is often small and hard. When a person experiences constipation as one of the principal symptoms of their irritable bowel syndrome, this is sometimes called IBS-C.","Good to know: IBS-C shares many symptoms ‒ including bloating, abdominal pain and infrequent, difficult bowel movements ‒ with another common gastrointestinal disorder, chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC). Current research suggests that that IBS-C and CIC are different conditions, despite their significantly overlapping symptoms. If a person seeks medical attention for constipation, doctors will ensure that appropriate testing is undertaken so that a differential diagnosis can be made, as these conditions require different treatment approaches to relieve constipation.[5]",Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with constipation and diarrhea,"When a person is equally affected by constipation and diarrhea as symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, this is called IBS-M (mixed irritable bowel syndrome) or IBS-A (alternating irritable bowel syndrome.",Rectal tenesmus,"Rectal tenesmus involves cramping and spasms in the rectum. This leads to feeling that a bowel movement is incomplete, even if the bowel has actually been evacuated successfully. This feeling may lead to abdominal pain and cramping, associated with straining to bring about a bowel movement.","Good to know: Tenesmus is a symptom of many other gastrointestinal conditions, as well as a symptom of IBS. If a person seeks medical attention for rectal tenesmus, doctors will check for inflammation of the colon, to rule out a diagnosis such as ulcerative colitis (a form of IBD) or colon cancer.",Bloating and gas,Many people with IBS experience intense bloating (a sensation of increased abdominal pressure). This may or may not be due to an increased quantity of gas in the gastrointestinal tract; about 50 % of people experience increased abdominal pressure without a buildup of gas.[6],Some people with irritable bowel syndrome also experience increased burping.,Mucus in stool,"Passing mucus in the stool is a common symptom of IBS, but passing blood may indicate a more serious condition affecting the bowel, colon or gastrointestinal tract. Always seek medical attention for a prompt diagnosis if blood is present in bowel movements.",People experiencing any possible symptoms of IBS can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.,Causes of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS),"Despite ongoing research to determine definitive causes of IBS, these are still unclear. Contributing
factors may include infection, neurohormonal factors, food sensitivities and bacterial overgrowth. An individual’s psychological condition, hormone changes or stress levels are other possible causes.",Infection,"It has been observed that some patients experience their first IBS symptoms after acute infectious
enteritis. This so-called postinfectious IBS may be caused by viral, bacterial, protozoan or helminth
infection. Several research studies have shown that IBS symptoms can increase after infectious enteritis, but the actual cause of these symptoms requires further research.",Neurohormonal factors,"Some people experience visceral hypersensitivity, which is a greater sensitivity to pain from the
organs, including the stretching of the bowel as gas or stool passes through it. This may be linked
to IBS symptoms including abdominal pain, urgent bowel movements, and bloating. However, the cause of this hypersensitivity is unknown.[7] It is also possible that the brain of a person with IBS
processes pain differently than that of an unaffected person, or that other differences in the
signals passed between the brain and the intestinal tract are related to IBS.[8]","Neurotransmitters or reproductive hormones may be imbalanced in some people with IBS, and these may be affected by changes to an individual’s hormones, such as throughout the menstrual cycle. The possible role of sexual hormones in IBS may be supported by the fact that roughly twice as many women as men are affected in some countries.[9]",Food sensitivities,"It has been observed that an individual with IBS may experience symptoms more often due to an
intolerance of foods such as wheat; dairy products; fatty, creamy or fried foods; alliums such as
garlic or onions; stone fruits and other kinds of fruit; brassicae such as cabbage, cauliflower
or Brussels sprouts; pulses such as lentils or beans and chili peppers.","Eliminating certain foods from the diet has been shown by some dietary studies to relieve the symptoms of IBS, but these foods vary according to the individual. More research on food sensitivities and their effect on IBS is required.",SIBO,"Small intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is when too many of the gut’s naturally occurring
bacteria accumulate in the small intestine. Some research has linked SIBO to IBS, and that
antibiotic treatment has decreased IBS symptoms in some people with SIBO.[10] It is not clear
from this research whether antibiotics affect the SIBO directly, or affect the IBS in a
different manner.",Malabsorption of fructose,"In some people, IBS symptoms can be caused by the digestive system failing to absorb fructose effectively. Fructose is a kind of sugar found in fruits and some vegetables, and is often used as an artificial sweetener in processed foods. When fructose is not absorbed properly by the digestive system, it can ferment in the colon (large intestine). This can result in gastrointestinal symptoms such as gas, bloating and diarrhea.","For people whose IBS is believed to result from malabsorption of fructose, eating foods which are low in fructose may be helpful in reducing their symptoms. See this resource from the University of Virginia’s Digestive Health Centre for more information on low-fructose foods.",Additional factors,"IBS is often linked to psychological factors such as stress, anxiety or depression, and stress
management is one possible treatment tool. Genetics may play a role in the development of IBS,
but there is limited evidence to support this.",Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) diagnosis,"A diagnosis of IBS is usually made by considering recurrence of symptoms over a period of three to six months, rather than solely through a physical examination or by visual inspection of the bowel during colonoscopy. To assist doctors in making a diagnosis, a person may keep a diary of their diet and gastrointestinal symptoms during this period, in order to identify factors which may be triggering their possible IBS.","Although it does not form the sole basis of a diagnosis of IBS, a colonoscopy may still be performed as part of an IBS diagnosis to help rule out other issues. This is an imaging procedure in which the colon or large intestine is visualised by inserting a thin, flexible tube containing a camera into the body through the rectum. See this resource on preparing for a colonoscopy for more information.","Other possible measures which may be used in making a potential diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome include a blood or stool test, flexible sigmoidoscopy or a barium series.[11]",People experiencing possible symptoms of IBS can also use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.,Irritable bowel syndrome treatments,Lifestyle changes,Lifestyle changes addressing diet or stress are usually the first approach to IBS treatment.,Stress and anxiety treatments,"Addressing generalized stress and anxiety is a common treatment approach. Some people experience
anxiety around their IBS symptoms (known as GI symptom-specific anxiety), and may limit their
exposure to activities and situations that would be affected by their IBS. This can increase
their anxiety, creating a vicious cycle that increases their symptoms. Therapies like cognitive
behavioral therapy, psychotherapy, relaxation therapy, biofeedback and hypnotherapy may be used
to help individuals both manage general stress and break this cycle.
Self-care to manage stress is another option, with common techniques including meditation,
yoga and exercise.",IBS and diet,"Each person has different dietary triggers for IBS. If sensitivity to specific foods is a trigger
for IBS symptoms, treatment may include reducing or eliminating these foods from the diet. Many people find it helpful to avoid high-FODMAP foods; FODMAP stands for: Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides And polyols; fermentable short-chain carbohydrates which are prevalent in a regular diet, which the small intestine does not absorb very well.[12]",Examples of low FODMAP foods which may ease symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome when included in a person’s diet include:[12],"Lactose-free or low-lactose dairy products, such as non-dairy milks, hard cheeses such as cheddar
Low-fructose fruits such as oranges, kiwis and strawberries
Low-fructan vegetables such as bean sprouts, carrots, eggplant, potatoes, olives, turnips
Protein such as lean meat and tofu
Gluten-free grains","Examples of high FODMAP foods, which may aggravate symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, and should be excluded from one’s diet where possible, include:[12]","Lactose; cow’s milk, yoghurt, and cream
Fructose; fruits and products high in natural sugars from fruit, such as apples, pears, peaches, corn syrup
Fructans; vegetables and grains high in fructans include artichokes, garlic, onions, broccoli, beetroot and grains such as wheat and rye
Polyols; sweeteners such as sorbitol and xylitol, found in sugar-free products","Another approach to alleviating symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome by changing one’s diet is to eat smaller, more frequent meals. Eating more slowly can reduce gas and bloating. Along with an individual’s possible food intolerances, foods commonly associated with abdominal cramping or diarrhea include coffee, caffeine, alcohol or high-fat foods, as well as poorly-digested sugars, such as sorbitol or fructose. Beans, raisins or breads can cause gas, and lactose intolerance can trigger IBS symptoms. Eating a high-fiber diet can improve stool quality and keep the GI tract healthy, but a diet excessively high in fiber can also cause gas and diarrhea.",Irritable bowel syndrome medications,Medications are available to treat moderate to severe IBS.,Anti-diarrheal medications,"Over the counter anti-diarrheal medications like loperamide (Imodium) are often used to treat IBS.
Common prescriptions drugs include diphenoxylate (Lomotil, Lomocot) and atropine.",Anticholinergic and antispasmodic medications,"Antispasmodic medications such as dicyclomine (Bentyl) and hyoscyamine (Levsin), as well as
anticholinergic medications, are commonly prescribed to decrease painful abdominal spasms.
Smooth muscle relaxants, such as alverine, mebeverine and peppermint oil may also be used.",Antidepressant medications,"People affected by IBS who also have depression may be prescribed selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors (SSRIs), such as fluoxetine (Prozac, Sarafem) or paroxetine (Paxil), as well as
tricyclic antidepressants, such as nortriptyline (Pamelor), imipramine (Tofranil) or
desipramine (Norpramin). People with IBS who do not experience depression may be also
prescribed antidepressants due to their effect on the connection between the brain and gut.",Probiotics and antibiotics,"An imbalance in the normal bacteria (gut flora) living in the human gut can affect its
function and overall wellness, and probiotic supplements can introduce healthy, normal
bacteria. More research is needed to prove their overall effectiveness, but some IBS
sufferers do gain relief from the use of probiotic supplements, with Bifidobacterium
infantis the most commonly studied probiotic.","Some IBS may be associated with an overgrowth or infection of harmful bacteria in the
gut, and antibiotic medications that reduce bacteria are a possible treatment. The

,,,,,,,,,,What is an ischemic stroke?
,,,,,,,,,,What is an ischemic stroke?,"Ischemic stroke occurs most often when a blood vessel supplying blood to the brain is blocked or obstructed by a blood clot or fatty deposit or any mix thereof. The brain relies on a constant supply of blood to provide it with oxygen and nutrients and to carry away carbon dioxide. When the blood flow, and therefore this supply, becomes interrupted or blocked, brain cells can quickly begin to stop working. If the blockage lasts for more than a couple of minutes, these cells can die, leading to serious damage to the brain.[1] Depending on the location and supply area of the affected vessel, the damage can range from mildly debilitating to severe or life-threatening.","There are two main types of stroke: the ischemic one introduced above, and the hemorrhagic one. Ischemic stroke is the most common, accounting for roughly 85 percent of all cases in the United States.[2] If prompt treatment is received, the effects of a stroke can be managed  in many cases. However, in some cases, ischemic stroke can lead to long-term disability and mortality, i.e. a person dying because of the condition.",Symptoms of ischemic stroke,"In most cases, the symptoms of an ischemic stroke will appear suddenly, within seconds or minutes. Because people experiencing a stroke require immediate treatment, it is important to be aware of the immediate signs and symptoms and take action without delay.",A useful acronym for remembering the signs and symptoms of an ischemic stroke is FAST:[3][4],"
Face. Weakness or drooping of the face, usually limited to or more pronounced on one side.
Arm. Numbness, weakness or strange sensations, e.g. pins and needles, in one or both arms.
Speech. Difficulty speaking or slurred speech, mumbling or not being able to speak at all.
Time to call the emergency services. The sooner an ambulance is called, the better the chances of a successful recovery.
",Other symptoms of ischemic stroke may include:[5],"
Weakness or numbness on one side of the body
Difficulty walking or getting up, e.g. from a chair or out of bed
Dropping to the floor
Headache
Dizziness
Sudden, new tinnitus - a ringing, swishing or whooshing sound in the ears
Nausea and vomiting
Soreness in the neck or face
Vision problems, i.e. double vision or an inability to see parts of one’s surrounding or anything at all
Confusion, sudden sleepiness, difficulty waking up
Sudden urinary incontinence, newly occurring with other symptoms
",The symptoms that are experienced will depend on what part of the brain is affected and may vary in severity from person to person.,Causes of ischemic stroke,"Ischemic stroke occurs when a blood vessel of the brain becomes blocked. This can happen as a result of several different conditions, including:[2][5]",Most commonly:,"
Atherosclerosis
Small vessel disease
Atrial fibrillation
",In rarer cases:,"
Arterial dissection, e.g. due to trauma or fibromuscular dysplasia
Certain blood clotting problems called coagulopathies, e.g. polycythemia or as a result of hormonal medications
Inflammation of the blood vessels, known as vasculitis, e.g. giant cell arteritis
Sickle cell disease
",Atherosclerosis,"A condition occurring when fatty deposits – called plaques or atheromas –  build up on the walls of the arteries, causing them to become narrower, harder and more easily blocked.",Small vessel disease,"Small vessel disease involves the collection of deposits within the small blood vessels of the brain. As these deposits develop, the blood vessels become harder and can eventually become completely blocked. It occurs primarily as a result of high blood pressure and diabetes.[5]",Atrial fibrillation,"Atrial fibrillation is a type of irregular heartbeat that can cause blood clots in the heart. These then enter the bloodstream and reach other parts of the body, e.g. the brain. If this happens, ischemic stroke can result.",Arterial dissection,"Arterial dissection is a rarer cause of stroke. The condition occurs when tears in the lining of the arteries develop and blood is able to get in between the different layers of the artery wall. As blood builds up, a blood clot can form and lead to a stroke.",Coagulopathies,"Though uncommon, certain blood clotting problems, where the blood clots too quickly, may cause a stroke. One example is polycythemia vera, a rare condition where the body produces too many red blood cells. This causes blood clots to form more easily - potentially leading to an ischemic stroke.[6][7]",Vasculitis,"This is the term for an inflammation in the blood vessels, which may develop as the result of an infection, another health condition or an adverse reaction to medication. Vasculitis may cause the blood vessels to narrow or even become blocked, potentially leading to an ischemic stroke.[8] One type of vasculitis is giant cell arteritis, a condition that affects the arteries in the head and upper part of the body.[9]",Sickle cell disease,"This genetic condition causes the shape of red blood cells to be abnormal. These red blood cells do not last very long, leading to anemia, and they can also block blood vessels - potentially leading to a stroke.[10][11]",Ischemic stroke risk factors,"There are a number of factors which can increase a person’s likelihood of experiencing an ischemic stroke. These include factors which a person themselves or treatment can change over time, and factors that cannot be changed.[4][5]",Factors that can be changed over time (modifiable factors) include:[5],"
High blood pressure - this is the strongest single risk factor for the development of both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke
Atherosclerosis (fatty deposits in the arteries)
Hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol levels in the blood)
Diabetes
Obesity and physical inactivity
Stress
High alcohol consumption
Tobacco use
Illicit (illegal) drug use
Cardiovascular (heart and heart vessel) diseases
Blood clotting disorders
Oral contraceptives (birth control pills)
Postmenopausal hormone intake
",Factors that cannot be changed over time (non-modifiable factors) include:[5],"
Being over the age of 40
Being male
Ethnicity - African Americans, Native Americans, Alaska Natives, and Hispanic people are at higher risk
Family history of stroke, heart or heart vessel conditions
Genetic disorders, e.g. sickle cell disease
","Recent childbirth also leads to a somewhat increased risk of stroke, due to an increased risk of blood clotting problems.","Although the above factors may make a stroke more likely, people who do not possess any risk factors may also experience a stroke.",Diagnosing ischemic stroke,"Anyone displaying any signs of stroke should immediately be taken to a hospital emergency room for diagnosis. Typically, this will first involve a physical examination, that may include an ECG to rule out atrial fibrillation and a review of the person’s medical history, before a number of other scans and tests.[4]",Brain scans,"Brain scans can help establish whether a stroke is ischemic or hemorrhagic, as well as its severity and the part of the brain affected. CT and MRI scans are the most commonly used types of scans for people suspected of having a stroke.[12][5]","
CT scans allow doctors to create a 3D image of the brain, enabling them to see what section of the brain is being affected and whether a stroke is ischemic or hemorrhagic. A CT scan is, in general, the best option (gold standard) and is quicker than an MRI scan. However, it may not be able to detect blood vessel blockages in the very early stages. Within the first 30 minutes of the blockage, an MRI will most likely produce more reliable results.
MRI scans use radio waves and a strong magnetic field to build a detailed image of the interior of the body. In the first 30 minutes from the onset of stroke symptoms, an MRI may be able to detect blood vessel blockages and stroke damage more accurately than a CT scan.
","Brain scans should be carried out as quickly as humanly possible when the person reaches the hospital, allowing for prompt and appropriate treatment to be received.",Heart and blood vessel tests,Various heart and blood vessel tests can be used to establish the cause of a stroke. Two of the most common are carotid ultrasound and echocardiography.,"
Carotid ultrasound is able to identify any blockages or clots in the arteries running along the neck and leading to the brain.
Echocardiography is a kind of ultrasound that can produce a detailed picture and provide certain measurements of the heart, enabling doctors to locate any issues that may have contributed to the stroke.
",Ischemic stroke treatment,"The aim of treatment for ischemic stroke is to restore blood flow as quickly as possible to the affected area of the brain. This will usually involve a combination of different medications while the person is being treated in the hospital and possibly others, once they are at home or at a rehabilitation facility. Some of these will only need to be taken for a short period of time, while others may be used to prevent future recurrences of stroke and will require long-term use.[13][14]",Some of the most commonly prescribed medications for treating an ischemic stroke include:,"
Alteplase: A type of medication used to dissolve clots and restore blood flow to the brain. Alteplase is most effective when administered as soon as possible after the stroke has taken place. It will most often be given through a drip into a person’s veins, from where it will spread through the entire blood vessel system. Sometimes, the medication has to be given directly into an artery, close to the obstruction - this procedure is then called intra-arterial thrombolysis. Alteplase can only be used for ischemic strokes, not if there is bleeding into the brain - as in the case of a hemorrhagic stroke. To confirm that the stroke is indeed ischemic in nature, alteplase can only be prescribed following a brain scan.
Antiplatelets: This type of medication helps to prevent further clots from forming. Aspirin is the most common antiplatelet, as well as a painkiller, though others, such as clopidogrel and dipyridamole, are also sometimes used.
Anticoagulants: This type of medication, sometimes called blood thinners, includes drugs like warfarin or heparin and can be used to help reduce the chances of a stroke recurring by preventing blood clots from forming. Anticoagulants are sometimes also used in the acute treatment of a stroke.
",Mechanical thrombectomy,"In some cases, usually those involving a blood clot in one of the brain’s larger arteries, a procedure known as a mechanical thrombectomy may be used. During a thrombectomy, a catheter is inserted into the affected artery, through which a device, known as a stent retriever, is able to remove the clot in the artery in the brain. The procedure can be done under general or local anesthetic and is most effective when carried out shortly after the stroke has taken place. The procedure will usually be carried out in addition to IV thrombolytic therapy, e.g. with alteplase.",Ischemic stroke complications,"A number of complications can arise in the days and weeks after a person has experienced a stroke, either while they are still in hospital or once they are at home or in a rehabilitation facility. These complications are important to recognize and treat in a timely manner, as they can, in some cases, lead to serious health problems and mortality (people dying from the condition).",Some of the most common complications include:[5],Blood clots,"While recovering from ischemic stroke, there is an increased risk of developing blood clots due to lack of moving around. This can be especially serious if a clot develops in the deep veins of the leg (deep vein thrombosis), breaks off and travels to the lungs. This can result in a condition known as pulmonary embolus or embolism, which can be potentially fatal. Older age and a lack of mobility during the recovery period increases the risk of deep vein thrombosis.","Doctors and physical therapists will advise on how to help prevent the development of blood clots. This may include the use of intermittent pneumatic compression devices, i.e. an inflatable sleeve that is wrapped around the legs, helping to increase circulation, compression stockings  and anticoagulant medication. People recovering from a stroke are also encouraged to move around frequently.",Dysphagia,"Dysphagia refers to difficulty swallowing. This can occur after a stroke due to problems coordinating between the muscles of the tongue, mouth and throat. Dysphagia results in an increased risk of inhaling saliva or food into the lungs, which can lead to aspiration pneumonia, a condition that can worsen the prognosis of people who have had a stroke.","To determine whether a person is experiencing difficulty swallowing, doctors will typically perform a water test. This involves swallowing a small amount of water while being monitored. If dysphagia is suspected, people may be temporarily fed through a drip into the veins, a nasogastric feeding tube or, in rarer cases, a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube. Further details are provided below.",Nutrition,"People recovering from a stroke often experience difficulty consuming enough calories. This can prolong the recovery period and in some cases lead to long-term disability. If it is suspected that a person will not be able consume enough calories themselves, a type of feeding tube known as a nasogastric tube (NGT)may be fitted through the nose. Through this tube, food and necessary nutrients can be supplied directly to the stomach as a short-term solution. In some cases, a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube may need to be fitted through the abdomen (belly) as a longer-term feeding solution.[15][16]",Urinary tract infection,"Urinary tract infections are a common complication of a stroke. This is generally because people in recovery often experience difficulty with getting out of bed to urinate, bladder leakage and problems fully emptying their bladders. Depending on the type of stroke, temporary use of a catheter may be recommended to decrease the risk of urinary tract infection. However, the use of a catheter comes with its own risk of urinary tract infection, meaning most people are advised to only use a catheter when necessary and to change the catheter regularly.",Heart problems,"Heart abnormalities seem to be quite common in people who have had a stroke. Though often difficult to do so, in the interests of effective care, it is important to identify whether the heart problems led to the stroke, resulted from the stroke, or are entirely unrelated, and treat them accordingly to minimize the risk of further complications. Through an electrocardiogram (ECG), blood tests and monitoring, doctors are able to determine the potential risk of heart problems and recommend appropriate treatment options.[17]",Bed sores,Bed sores are common in people recovering from a stroke due to the large amount of time spent in bed. Bed sores can vary in severity from mild redness to deep sores extending down to the bone. Bed sores can cause severe irritation and increase the risk of infection.,"Frequent movement, which may need to be assisted, is recommended to prevent the development of bed sores. Care should also be taken to avoid pressure on sensitive areas such as the knees, ankles and heels.",Falls,"People recovering from a stroke may experience difficulty walking. Lack of movement can increase the risk of bone thinning and muscle weakness, which can in turn increase the chances of falling and breaking a bone. To help prevent this, people will often be encouraged to partake in muscle strengthening exercises and rehabilitation appropriate to their condition.",Ischemic stroke prevention,"Although some of the risk factors of a stroke – such as family history and being over the age of 40 – are uncontrollable, other risk factors can be managed to help decrease the chances of a stroke. These risk factors include:[18]","
High blood pressure If a person’s blood pressure is outside the normal range, steps can be taken to help bring it down. These steps may include maintaining a healthy weight, exercising and eating healthily. If these measures are not sufficient and it is deemed necessary by a medical professional, taking appropriate medication against hypertension may also be recommended.
Smoking: Quitting smoking reduces the risk of stroke. Doctors and specialists are able to recommend supportive measures, e.g. structured programs and/or medications to help people quit.
Heart problems: Heart disorders, such as coronary artery disease and irregular heartbeat (atrial fibrillation), increase the risk of stroke. People with such a heart problem should seek medical attention. Treatment for these heart problems will help reduce the chances of stroke.
Diabetes: Receiving proper treatment for diabetes type 2, as well as type 1, is helpful in preventing a stroke.
Obesity/inactivity: A sedentary, inactive and nutritionally unhealthy lifestyle leading to obesity is strongly linked to heart problems, diabetes and high blood pressure. Maintaining a healthy weight and leading an active lifestyle is an effective way of helping to prevent a stroke.
",Ischemic stroke FAQs,"Q: What is the difference between an ischemic stroke and a hemorrhagic stroke?
A: An ischemic stroke occurs when a blood vessel leading to the brain becomes blocked or obstructed. This is the most common type of stroke, accounting for roughly 85 percent of all cases. A hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a weakened blood vessel ruptures, usually as a result of high blood pressure.[19]"
,,,,,,,,,,What is juvenile idiopathic arthritis?
,,,,,,,,,,What is juvenile idiopathic arthritis?,"Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), previously known as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) or juvenile chronic arthritis, is a chronic inflammatory condition primarily affecting the joints, and which occurs in children under 16 years old.","There are different types of JIA with varying symptoms and degrees of likelihood that a child will grow out of the condition. All types of JIA involve pain, swelling and stiffness of one or more joints.","JIA is an autoimmune reaction. This means that the immune system mistakenly forms antibodies, proteins which are meant to fight infections but attack the body tissue instead. The causes are not well understood, but factors such as genetics and infections may influence the development of JIA.","Treatment often involves taking medications that suppress the immune system to a degree. Many children with this condition live well with treatment, and find that their symptoms improve over time. Many cases of JIA will resolve, though it is not possible to accurately predict this. In about 30 percent of cases, JIA can remain active into adult life.[1]",JIA is the most common autoimmune joint condition in children. It tends to affect children younger than 10 but does not generally affect those younger than six months old. Girls are more commonly affected than boys and tend to show symptoms at a younger age.,Symptoms,Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is characterized by joint inflammation over a period of six weeks or more.,Symptoms of inflammation in the joints include:[2][3],"
Swelling
Stiffness
Pain
Sensation of heat
Redness
","Symptoms may develop slowly or abruptly, often with increased stiffness in the morning or following inactivity.",Less common signs and symptoms of JIA may include:[2][3],"
Rash on the torso, arms or legs, which quickly fades or changes
Fever, often spiking once or twice each day at about the same time
Anemia
Limping
Not using or a reluctance to use a certain limb
Loss of motor skill function
General pain
Fatigue
Sleep problems
Swollen lymph nodes
Weight loss and a reduced appetite
Psoriasis or other skin abnormalities

Growth disturbances leading to limb length discrepancy
","The joints that are most commonly affected in JIA are the wrists, knees and ankles, but other joints can also be involved.",Types of juvenile idiopathic arthritis,"There are six defined types of JIA, with diagnostic criteria varying according to factors, which include :[2][4]","
Number of joints affected in the first six months
Presence of laboratory markers in the blood that are typical of autoimmune diseases
Symptoms present in other areas of the body
","In about 1 to 10 percent of cases of JIA, the arthritis may not fit into any of the types listed below, in which case it is called undifferentiated arthritis.",JIA may be classified as one of the following six subtypes:,"Oligoarticular JIA: This is the most common type of JIA, making up about half of all cases. Diagnosis may be made if between one and four joints are affected in the first six months. This type of JIA is the most likely to resolve, leaving little or no joint damage. The condition is known as persistent oligoarthritis if it continues affecting up to four joints after six months, or known as extended oligoarthritis if it affects more than six joints after six months. Oligoarticular JIA commonly affects one or both knees and is often mild. It is also the type of JIA most likely to cause uveitis – eye inflammation – so requires regular eye checks.","Polyarticular JIA: rheumatoid factor negative: This accounts for about a quarter of all cases of JIA. Diagnosis may be made if five or more joints are affected in the first six months and a blood test for rheumatoid factor (RF) is negative. It may involve tiredness and occasional slight fever. This type of JIA may remain into adult life, but can go into remission, where the condition is symptomless. However, there is a remaining high risk of physical impairments.","Polyarticular JIA: rheumatoid factor positive: This accounts for about 5 percent of all cases of JIA. Diagnosis may be made if five or more joints are affected in the first six months and a blood test for rheumatoid factor (RF) is positive. It may involve tiredness and occasional slight fever. This type of JIA may remain into adult life, but can go into remission, where the condition is symptomless. It tends to persist and has an increased risk of rapid progressive destruction of affected joints.","Systemic onset JIA, also known as Still’s disease: This accounts for about 5 - 10 percent of all cases of JIA. Diagnosis may be made if there is arthritis in one or more joints with, or preceded by, fever of at least two weeks' duration, and if one or more of the following signs and symptoms are present:","
Swollen glands in neck, armpits and groin
Quickly fading rash
Increased liver and/or spleen size
Pericarditis:: inflammation of the heart lining; pleuritis: inflammation of the lungs; or peritonitis: inflammation of the abdomen
","There may be no joint symptoms in the first few weeks. The outlook for systemic onset JIA may be difficult to predict. Any fever or rash usually settles, and arthritis may continue for several years before settling.","Juvenile psoriatic arthritis: This accounts for about 2 - 15 percent of all cases of JIA. Diagnosis may be made if arthritis occurs with psoriasis, a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin with silvery scales, or if arthritis occurs with at least two of the following factors:","
Inflammation of toe or finger
Indentation on the nails
Painless separation of the nail from the nail bed
A first-degree relative with psoriasis
","The outlook for juvenile psoriatic arthritis may be difficult to predict. In about 30 - 40 percent of cases, the condition remains into adulthood. This type of JIA usually has a mild course of disease.","Enthesitis-related arthritis: This accounts for about 2 - 10 percent of all cases of JIA. Diagnosis may be made if arthritis occurs with enthesitis, inflammation of the enthesis, the connective tissue between tendons or ligaments and bone, or if arthritis occurs with two or more of the following factors:","
Pain in lower back
Positive HLA-B27 test: a marker of certain conditions
Other HLA-B27-associated conditions present, such as ankylosing spondylitis: spine inflammation); uveitis: inflammation of the eye; or ulcerative colitis: inflammation of the large intestine
Family history of HLA-B27-associated conditions
Child is male and older than six years
",This type of JIA usually has a mild course of disease.,Causes,It is not completely understood what causes JIA;  ‘idiopathic’ means of unknown cause.,"It is known that juvenile idiopathic arthritis is an autoimmune disease, which means that it is caused by abnormal functioning of the immune system. In a normally-functioning immune system, the body attacks foreign bacteria and viruses. In the case of autoimmune disease, the body accidentally attacks its own healthy tissue. In JIA, the body attacks its joint tissue.","Children with JIA produce an excess of white blood cells in the synovial membrane, the tissue that lines the cavities of joints; this causes inflammation. Occasionally, inflammation can also occur in other associated parts of the body, such as the lungs, heart and eyes.",Risk factors,There are three main risk factors for JIA:[5][6],Children aged 2-3 years old have the highest risk of JIA. It rarely occurs in babies younger than six months.,"Generally, girls are more than twice as likely as boys to develop JIA, but this may vary depending on the particular subtype.","Genetic factors are involved in the risk of developing JIA. However, JIA is not solely genetic and is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and other factors from the environment, such as infection, though thus far research has been limited in this area.",Diagnosis,"Diagnosis of JIA is generally made after referral to a pediatric rheumatologist, a type of doctor specializing in inflammation and pain in the joints, muscles or fibrous tissues of children.","To be classified as JIA, the signs and symptoms of the condition must occur before the age of 16 and  persist for a minimum of six weeks.[7]","There is no specific test for JIA. A pediatric rheumatologist will gather information to rule out other conditions and hone in on the cause of the patient’s symptoms. Initially, diagnosis will be attempted from reported medical history, symptoms and a physical examination. Where this does not yield a definite diagnosis, further laboratory tests and medical imaging may be used.",Good to know: Keeping a diary of symptoms may be helpful in making the diagnosis.,Interview and physical exam,The purpose of a physical examination is to look for the various early signs and symptoms of JIA that may be being experienced.,"Although it is rare for two or more members of the same family to be diagnosed with JIA, it is still important for doctors to look at one’s family medical history for any signs of predisposition to the condition. Doctors will pay particular attention to whether any family members have experienced an autoimmune disorder of any kind, as this may increase the chances of JIA.",Laboratory tests,"If a doctor suspects JIA, one or more blood tests may be ordered to confirm the diagnosis. Tests may include the following:[8][9]","Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs), which are proteins that recognize parts of the body’s own cells as something the body needs to fight in an autoimmune reaction. These are  sometimes found in children with JIA, as well as in other autoimmune diseases and in children with a family history of autoimmune diseases. ANAs are also found in some healthy children.","Complete blood count (CBC) and metabolic panel, which is a blood test used to look at all types of blood cells to determine how many there are and what they look like, in order to detect anything unusual and diagnose many medical conditions. Anemia – low levels of healthy red blood cells – is common in children with JIA. Lower levels of white blood cells may be a sign of JIA or other inflammatory conditions, or a reaction to certain medicines.","Inflammatory markers, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR or sed rate) and C-reactive protein (CRP) tests may be done as these may show whether there is inflammation and to what degree. However, these markers are not always present alongside inflammation.","HLA-B27, which is a protein on the surface of white blood cells; it is genetically inherited and has been linked with some types of JIA.","Rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies, which are proteins that attack healthy tissues. One of these is occasionally found in children with JIA.","If it is possible that symptoms may be caused by an infection within a joint, then fluid may be drawn out from the joint with a needle and sent for laboratory testing.",Medical imaging,"A doctor may also recommend an X-ray, ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the affected joint to help with diagnosis.[3] However, at an early stage of JIA, any characteristic damage caused by the condition may not yet be apparent.",Treatment,The main aims of treatment for JIA are:,"
To prevent joint damage
To minimize pain and other symptoms, and maintain quality of life
To prevent the development of associated conditions, such as growth problems, osteoporosis, puberty delay and reduced vision
",Medication,Medications to treat JIA are usually prescribed by a pediatric rheumatologist. There are four main types of JIA drugs that are used:[2][^10],Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) offer pain relief and reduce minor inflammation.,"Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) work by suppressing the overactive chemicals released by the immune system, which can damage nearby bones, tendons, ligaments and cartilage. These are usually administered by mouth.",Biological response modifiers work by targeting the immune system and modifying the molecules causing the inflammation. This type of medication is generally reserved for the treatment of those who have not responded to DMARDs. They are usually administered through injection.,"Steroids quickly improve inflammation. It is important that steroids are used judiciously in children and are tapered as soon as possible. The younger the child, the more a clinician will try to avoid this substance group.","They may be used in several ways, including being:","Taken orally to improve inflammation symptoms when these are present in other parts of the body, such as the heart lining, lungs and abdomen. This is only done rarely because of the risk of side-effects, such as osteoporosis and growth impairments.",Absorbed through eye drops in the case of eye inflammation.,Injected into affected joints.,Exercise and lifestyle changes,Physiotherapy and occupational therapy programmes can be helpful in maintaining strong joints and increasing the child’s ability to do normal activities.,Children should be encouraged to participate in as much physical activity as possible.,Other treatments and lifestyle changes may include:[9],"
Nutrition counseling
Regular eye exams to find and treat any eye inflammation early
Making sure to get enough sleep
","Good to know: Children with JIA may experience emotional, behavioral and academic difficulties due to being unable to participate in all physical activities and time spent away from school for hospital appointments and admissions. Therefore, children with JIA and their families may need support for these areas.",Complications,"There are several complications of JIA, which may or may not affect a child, depending on the type of JIA they have, how severe it is and how well-managed. Complications can affect various parts of the body, including bones, joints, muscles and eyes.",Complications may include:[^10][10],"Growth problems, which may include misshapen body parts, uneven limb lengths or slow growth overall, due to inflammation leading to abnormal bone formation or from steroids. Keeping JIA flare ups under control is the best way to avoid growth problems.","Osteoporosis - bone thinning and weakening - which make bones likely to fracture, may occur due to not staying active, not getting enough calcium or as a result of steroid treatment. Staying active as well as taking calcium and vitamin D supplements,  can help prevent osteoporosis.","Joint contractures, in which muscles and tendons do not grow properly and become stuck in a bent position, having been kept in this position to avoid discomfort due to inflammation. Regular stretching and use of splints can reduce joint tightness.","Muscle weakness and muscle loss, caused by abstaining from physical activities due to stiffness and pain. Regular exercise as recommended by a physiotherapist can help prevent muscle problems such as these.","Eye problems, such as uveitis (eye inflammation), glaucoma (optic nerve damage due to pressure of the fluid inside the eye), or cataracts (a clouding of the lens). A child with JIA should receive regular checks from an eye doctor to monitor for any eye problems before they create further damage.","Inflammation of other parts of the body, such as pericarditis – inflammation of the heart membrane, pleuritis – inflammation of the lungs; and peritonitis – inflammation of the abdomen lining. Such complications can be treated with anti-inflammatory medication.",FAQs,"Q: What is the juvenile idiopathic arthritis prognosis?
A: There is not one JIA, but several subtypes. Prognosis therefore depends on the particular subtype. Many children with this condition respond well to treatment and find that their symptoms improve over time. Many cases of JIA will resolve and leave a person without symptoms in adult life, though it is not possible to accurately predict this. In about 30 percent of cases, JIA may remain active into adult life. Some people may have joint damage, which can limit physical activities, and a few may require joint replacements, possibly later in adult life. Growth may be delayed, but can often resume with treatment, though some children may be physically smaller than average.","Q: Does juvenile idiopathic arthritis require surgery?
A: In most cases, surgery is not required, especially with recent advancements in medication. However, there are a few instances where surgery may be recommended. These include cases resulting in spinal deformity, spinal instability, nerve problems or severe damage to a joint. Surgical options include hip and knee replacements. This may be delayed until bones have finished growing to avoid complications.[11]","Q: What is the difference between juvenile idiopathic arthritis and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis? Are they just different ways of saying the same thing?
A: Not exactly, though there is a lot of overlap. Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) used to be the name used in the U.S. for a group of childhood arthritic conditions. In the late 1990s, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, along with the European term juvenile chronic arthritis, was replaced with the term juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). This incorporates all of what was called JRA in the past and also includes all other forms of ""idiopathic"" arthritis in childhood. Anyone who was diagnosed with JRA would normally today be diagnosed with JIA, but not all those diagnosed with JIA would have been diagnosed with JRA.[12]","Q: Is juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) the same as rheumatoid arthritis in adults? If JIA persists into adulthood, will it become rheumatoid arthritis?
A: No, JIA and rheumatoid arthritis are separate conditions which require different treatment and have different outcomes. A person who has JIA that persists into adulthood is considered to be an adult with a history of juvenile idiopathic arthritis. While the two diseases may have some similarities, they also have some key differences. Like rheumatoid arthritis, JIA is brought on by chronic inflammation that may cause disability if left untreated. However, JIA is not a single disease, but in fact several related conditions. A small number of children with JIA, actually have a condition indistinguishable from adult rheumatoid arthritis. Typically, this presents in post-pubescent girls, who are found to have high levels of rheumatoid factor antibodies with five or more joints affected, usually in a symmetrical arrangement.[13]",Other names for juvenile idiopathic arthritis,"

To be classified as JRA, the condition must persist for a minimum of six weeks and all other possible causes must be excluded.[1]","Although the exact causes of JRA remain unclear, it is known that the condition is an autoimmune disorder. This means that disordered functioning of the body’s immune system plays a role in the development of JRA.","In the majority of cases, the condition can be managed through prolonged treatment. This will typically involve a combination of medication and physical therapy.[2]",Types of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis,"There are various types of JRA, each with varying symptoms and levels of severity.[3]","Oligoarthritis: The most common type of JRA, affecting roughly one third of those with the condition. For diagnosis, no more than four joints in a person’s body will be affected within the first six months of developing this condition. Oligoarthritis typically affects one or both knees, and can also cause chronic eye inflammation in some cases.","Polyarthritis: The second most common form of JRA, which can develop suddenly or steadily over a period of weeks. For diagnosis, five or more joints must be affected during the first six months of the condition developing. It may cause painful inflammation of the wrists, ankles, toes, hips, knees, neck and jaw.","Enthesitis-related JRA: This condition typically causes inflammation of the leg joints and spine, at sites where tendons or ligaments insert into joints, such as the heel. In some cases, this will be accompanied by acute uveitis (a painful eye condition). Enthesitis-related JRA is often associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).","For more information about conditions related to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), see these resources on its two main forms, Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis.","Psoriatic arthritis: A combination of a skin rash, caused by a long-lasting autoimmune disease of the skin called psoriasis, with joint pain, usually in the fingers and toes.","Systemic JIA: Also known as Still’s disease, this condition consists of joint pain combined with fever, tiredness, loss of weight, lack of appetite and a rash. It may lead to enlarged glands in the groin, arms and neck, as well as an enlarged spleen and liver.",Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis symptoms,Some of the most common signs and symptoms of JRA include:[4],"
Tenderness and/or swelling of the joints
Joints that are warm to the touch
Rash
Fever
Limping
General pain
Stiffness (especially following sleep or inactivity)
Fatigue
Sleep problems
Swollen lymph nodes
Weight loss and a reduced appetite
","Symptoms typically vary from person to person although some are specific to certain subtypes of JRA. It is also possible for symptoms to alter over time, even over the course of a single day.","If symptoms arise it is important to seek medical attention. By examining the symptoms a child is experiencing and ruling out other possible causes, a doctor will generally be able to identify whether JRA is present. In addition, the free Ada app can be used to carry out a symptom assessment.",Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis complications,"With prompt and appropriate treatment, the prognosis for JRA can be greatly improved. However, without treatment or if the condition is particularly severe, complications can arise.",Complications associated with JRA can include:[5],"
Anemia (a lack of red blood cells or hemoglobin)
Permanent joint damage
Disproportionate limbs
Stunted growth (caused by the condition as well as some medications used to treat it)
Eye inflammation (typically painful and can in very severe cases lead to blindness)
","Although complications are possible, the risk of them occurring can be reduced through careful management of the condition.",Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis causes,"The causes of JRA are not fully understood. However, the condition is generally thought to be linked to a dysfunction of the immune system combined with genetic and/or environmental factors.","Research suggests that JRA may be triggered by abnormal immune responses to certain viruses or other agents, causing joint inflammation when it is not needed. Although it is uncommon for two members of the same family to experience JRA, genetic mechanisms are thought to play a role in determining who develops the condition.","Some research suggests human leukocyte antigens – a type of molecule which plays an important role in deciding how the body reacts to foreign agents – are particularly relevant to this process, with people who have an increased amount of a specific type of the molecule being at greater risk of developing JRA.[6][7]",Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis,"To be classified as JRA, the signs and symptoms of the condition must occur before the age of 16. These signs and symptoms are not always obvious or detectable, and as a child may not understand what is and isn’t normal, they may not complain about certain symptoms, such as joint pain.","However, by being aware of the symptoms of the condition and through careful monitoring of a child’s development, it should be possible for caregivers to identify the warning signs and ensure the required medical attention is sought.","There is no single test that can be used to diagnose JRA. Instead, the condition is diagnosed by ruling out other possible causes of the symptoms. This is done by using a combination of methods, including looking at an individual’s family history, carrying out a physical examination, blood tests and imaging scans.[8]",Family history,"Although it is rare for two or more members of the same family to be diagnosed with JRA, it is still important for doctors to look at one’s family medical history for any signs of predisposition to the condition. Doctors will pay particular attention to whether any family members have experienced an autoimmune disorder of any kind, as this may increase the chances of JRA.",Physical examination,The purpose of a physical examination is to look for the various early signs and symptoms of JRA that may be being experienced.,Doctors will look for signs and symptoms including:,"
A limp
Not using or a reluctance to use a certain limb
Stiffness (especially in the morning or after inactivity)
A fever which comes and goes
Joint swelling (lasting for six weeks or more)
Fatigue and inactivity
Loss of motor skill function
",Blood tests,A combination of different blood tests can be used to help diagnose JRA. These include:,"
Rheumatoid factor: Generally the first test to be carried out. It tests for the rheumatoid factor antibody (an immune system molecule in the blood) which, although undetectable in more than 50% of cases, can indicate the presence of JRA.
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) A test to measure levels of inflammation in the body.
C-Reactive protein: Another test that can measure levels of inflammation.
Antinuclear antibody: A test for antinuclear antibodies, which are often found in those with autoimmune disorders, including JRA.
Cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP): Although CCP is not routinely tested for in children, in some cases doctors may carry out tests for the presence of CCP antibodies which can then sometimes indicate JRA.
",The results of these tests can help doctors in making a diagnosis.,Eye tests,"Visits  to an ophthalmologist (a doctor specializing in eye care) are necessary to check for eye inflammation, both in the process of diagnosing JRA and to monitor disease progression. Left untreated, prolonged eye inflammation may lead to vision loss.",Imaging scans,"Imaging scans – such as X-rays or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) – can be used to help doctors identify any fractures, bone erosion, infections and any other damage which may help in their diagnosis.",Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis treatment,"The aim of JRA treatment is to minimize pain, retain one’s range of motion and muscle function, facilitate normal growth and development, as well as to prevent serious complications. To achieve this, a long-term treatment plan involving a combination of drugs and physical therapy will typically be necessary.[9]","In very rare cases, surgery may also be called for to help repair joint or bone damage caused by the condition.",Medication,"A range of medications are available to help treat JRA. Due to the severity of the side-effects that may be caused by many of these medications, doctors will usually be cautious about prescribing large doses, especially in the early stages of the condition. As the condition progresses and if symptoms become more severe, larger doses may be called for.",Some of the most commonly prescribed medications for treating JRA include:[10][11][12][13],"Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): In most cases, NSAIDs will be used in the initial stages of treatment to help relieve pain and ease inflammation. This type of medication also has few side-effects. Some NSAIDs are available over the counter (ibuprofen, for example), while others need to  be prescribed by a doctor. Although NSAIDs can help to relieve certain symptoms, they do not affect the overall prognosis of JRA.","Corticosteroids: Used to treat inflammation, pain and stiffness. These can be taken orally or injected directly into the affected area, which is particularly effective as a form of pain relief. They may lead to serious side effects (including weakened bones) if taken over a long period.",Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs): This type of medication works by altering the way the immune system works. They are generally prefered by doctors treating JRA because of  their lack of side effects and  general efficacy. Methotrexate is the most commonly administered type of DMARD.,"Biological response modifiers: Generally reserved for the treatment of those who have not responded to DMARDs, this type of medication works by targeting the immune system and modifying the molecules causing the inflammation. They are usually administered through injection or infusion. Commonly prescribed drugs in this category are Etanercept or Adalimumab.",Physical and occupational therapy,"Although movement may become painful for people with JRA, it is important to try and maintain an active, healthy lifestyle. This has the effect of keeping muscles and joints strong and flexible, and may reduce inflammation. A physical therapist will typically be recommended to help those with the condition to design an appropriate exercise plan which suits their individual needs.",Diet,"Although there are no specialist guidelines regarding diet for those with JRA, it is generally recommended that individuals eat a healthy and balanced diet. It may also be helpful to consume the following types of food, each known to contain anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties:[14]","
Oily fish high in Omega-3 (such as salmon, tuna and mackerel)
Fruits and vegetables (especially strawberries, blueberries and cherries)
Citrus fruits (high in vitamin C)
Nuts
Beans
",Surgery,"Surgery is rare in the treatment of JRA, as medications and physical therapy are generally sufficient. However, in a small number of cases – for example, if the condition is affecting the curvature of the spine – surgery may be performed. The need for surgery will be assessed on a case-by-case basis by doctors.[14]",Other names for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis,"

",Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis FAQs,"Q: What happens to people with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis after the age of 16?
A: It may seem logical to think of JRA as simply a form of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) experienced by people under the age of 16. In reality, JRA is a distinct condition with its own characteristics. For this reason, it not usual for JRA to simply become or graduate to rheumatoid arthritis in people over the age of 16. Instead, it is better to describe people in this situation as adults with a history of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.","In rare cases, however, children diagnosed with JRA may actually have RA. If this is identified, it will then be accurate to describe the condition as RA. In other rare cases, the symptoms of JRA may fade as a child enters adulthood. This is typically the case in those who are diagnosed with JRA at a very young age and experience a mild form of the condition.[15]","Q: What is the life expectancy for people with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis?
A: It is difficult to give an accurate prognosis in cases of JRA. The condition is typically experienced throughout one’s life, but with proper treatment and management its symptoms can be effectively controlled. However, average life expectancies for people with JRA are generally shorter than those for people without the condition. The main reason for this is not the condition itself but the complications which can arise from the condition.[16]"

,,,,,,,,,,What is keratoconjunctivitis sicca?,"Keratoconjunctivitis sicca is a common condition which is also known as dry eye syndrome. Dry eye syndrome can occur when less tears are produced than normal, if the tears don't spread effectively over the eye, or if the tears dry too quickly. Some cases of dry eye syndrome may occur as a result of another medical condition or due to medication use. There also may be no obvious cause in others. This condition is more common in older people. People with this condition may have dry, gritty, red eyes and blurry vision. Dry eyes are treated by using lubricating eye drops and by finding and treating the cause of their condition. Avoiding dry air, wind and wearing glasses or goggles can help to reduce the symptoms of this condition. Many people with dry eyes can treat the cause of their symptoms, or, if the cause can't be corrected, can learn to manage their symptoms.",Risks,"The eye is usually covered with a thin layer of tears which act to protect the eye from particles in the air. Dry eye syndrome can occur when less tears are produced than normal, if the tears don't spread effectively over the eye, or if the tears dry too quickly. There are many causes. Some medical conditions cause dry eyes, such as diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis and amyloidosis. Exposure to dry air or wind can also cause dry eyes. Many women find that changing hormone levels when taking the (oral contraceptive) pill or during the menopause cause them to have dry eyes. Lastly, some common medications can cause dry eyes, such as some blood pressure medications, antihistamine medications and some antidepressant medications. This condition becomes more common with age.",Symptoms,"Common symptoms of dry eye syndrome are a gritty sensation in the eye, itching eyes, blurred vision, reddening of the eyes and eyes which are sensitive to light. This may affect one eye or both eyes. People with dry eyes may feel that their eyes feel tired after long periods of writing or computer work.",Diagnosis,Diagnosis is made by examining the surface of the eye and by testing the amount of tears produced in a given time. The test to measure tear production involves placing a strip of paper along the bottom eyelid to absorb and measure the tears over a given time.,Treatment,"The treatment of dry eye syndrome involves treating the symptoms and treating the underlying condition. Lubricating eye drops can be helpful to reduce the gritty, irritated feeling. Avoiding smoke, dust, dry air and eye make-up can also be helpful. People who wear contact lenses should get advice from their doctor or optometrist about whether they should avoid these. If an underlying disease is responsible for the symptoms, managing this can improve the symptoms.",Prevention,Avoiding dry air and windy conditions may help prevent symptoms of dry eye.

,,,,,,,,,,What is keyhole surgery?
,,,,,,,,,,What is keyhole surgery?,"Keyhole surgery, or minimally invasive surgery, is a surgical method used to access the interior of the body through a small incision, removing the need for open surgery.[1] Generally, keyhole surgery is used to access the abdomen and the female pelvic organs in a procedure known as a laparoscopy. When used to access the thorax (chest), the procedure is known as a thoracoscopy.","During keyhole surgery, a thin telescope fitted with a light source and a camera – called a laparoscope – is passed through a small incision in the skin, giving doctors a magnified view of the inside of the body. Surgical instruments can also be passed through the incision, allowing surgeons to operate.","Keyhole surgery may be used to diagnose certain medical conditions, as well as to perform a variety of surgical procedures, such as the removal of damaged or diseased organs or parts of organs.","Keyhole surgery is a commonly performed procedure with a number of advantages over traditional open surgery. These include reduced recovery times after the surgery and reduced levels of pain, scarring and hemorrhaging. The procedure is generally safe, though possible complications do exist.",When is keyhole surgery needed?,Keyhole surgery can be used to diagnose and treat a range of conditions.[2],It is most commonly used in:,"
Gastroenterology. To diagnose and treat conditions related to the digestive system
Gynaecology. To diagnose and treat conditions related to the female reproductive system
Urology. To diagnose and treat conditions affecting the urinary system
",For diagnosis,"If non-invasive diagnostic methods like ultrasound or CT scans prove ineffective or produce no conclusive results, keyhole surgery may be necessary. Keyhole surgery may be used to help diagnose conditions including:","
Appendicitis
Inflammation of the gallbladder/gallstones
Pelvic inflammatory disease
Endometriosis
Ectopic pregnancy
Ovarian cyst
Fibroids
Female infertility
Unexplained abdominal or pelvic pain
","Keyhole surgery may also be used to obtain a tissue sample (in a procedure called a biopsy). This involves extracting a small amount of tissue from the relevant area, before sending it to a lab for analysis. The information collected by performing a biopsy can help diagnose and differentiate between various types of tumours, which may be non-cancerous growths, as well as cancer.",Feeling unwell? Get a free symptom assessment with the Ada app.,For treatment,Keyhole surgery can also be used as a treatment option. It is commonly used to:,"
Remove the appendix in cases of appendicitis
Remove the gallbladder
Remove sections of the intestine
Treat hernias (when an organ or part of an organ protrudes through a weak spot in the abdominal wall)
Treat problematic stomach ulcers
Remove or partially remove organs affected by cancer, including the ovaries, kidneys, colon, liver, prostate and bladder
Treat ectopic pregnancy
Remove fibroids
Remove the womb, in cases of pelvic inflammatory disease or endometriosis, for example
",How is keyhole surgery performed?,"Keyhole surgery is normally performed under general anaesthesia. While under general anaesthesia, the person undergoing surgery is put to sleep and woken up once the procedure is complete.","Once under general anaesthesia, first, the individual’s skin will be cleaned, before a number of small incisions (usually 2 to 3 incisions, 1-2 cm long) are made through the skin. Gas, usually carbon dioxide or nitrous oxide, is injected through one of the incisions, inflating the abdomen and allowing doctors to see more clearly. The laparoscope will then be inserted through the incisions, with the attached camera allowing doctors to see images from inside the cavity.","In most cases, multiple incisions will be necessary in order to allow different surgical instruments to be used during the procedure. A more modern technique called a single-port laparoscopy allows doctors to perform operations using a single incision.","After the procedure is complete, all instruments will be removed and the incision will be stitched up and dressed.[3]",How to prepare for keyhole surgery,"Before going under general anaesthesia, a period of fasting will generally be necessary, which will also involve refraining from chewing gum or smoking, for example. Doctors will give specific instructions on how to go about this, and these will need to be followed closely.[3]",Recovering from keyhole surgery,"After the procedure, people who have undergone keyhole surgery will be observed in hospital for a number of hours while having their vital signs monitored. The amount of time necessary for observation will depend on the condition of the individual and the type of anaesthesia used. In some cases, a hospital stay of 1-3 days, or, more rarely, of up to a week may be necessary.[4]","In the hours and days following surgery, a person may feel mild to moderate pain in the area where the incision was made. As a result of the gas, pain may also be felt in the shoulder area and bloating may be experienced. These side-effects will usually subside in a number of days.","If keyhole surgery has been used to diagnose a condition, regular activities can normally be resumed in under a week. If used to treat a condition, recovery times will depend upon what kind of surgery has been undertaken, with recovery times usually ranging from 2 to 12 weeks.",Complications associated with keyhole surgery,"Severe complications as a result of keyhole surgery are rare, while minor complications are more common but generally easily treatable.[5]",Possible minor complications include:[2],"
Nausea or vomiting (this is a non-serious reaction to the anaesthetic and affects roughly 20 to 30 percent of people who undergo keyhole surgery)
Bruising or bleeding around the incision
Infection of the incision area
",Possible major complications include:,"
Damaged organs, which could lead to organ failure
Injured blood vessels/artery damage
Complications associated with the use of carbon dioxide during the procedure – for example, gas bubbles entering the bloodstream
Serious allergic reaction to general anaesthetic
Blood clotting
Infection of deeper areas beyond the incision, involving the entire abdominal wall or the lining of the abdominal cavity
",Feeling unwell? Get a free symptom assessment with the Ada app.,Advantages of keyhole surgery over open surgery,There are a number of advantages of keyhole surgery over traditional open surgery.[6],"Reduced physical impact: Operating through small incisions rather than large open wounds reduces the amount of blood that is lost, as well as the pain and discomfort that is felt by the patient after the surgery. Due to the small size of the instruments used during the procedure, tissue damage is also reduced. On the outside of the body, this will result in smaller scars, giving improved cosmetic outcomes after the surgery compared to open surgery.","Reduced risk of complications: After the procedure, the risk of complications such as infection, hernia and cellulitis (bacterial infection of the skin and tissues beneath the skin) is also lessened. Risks associated with the partially unavoidable cooling, drying and excessive handling of internal organs are also less likely in keyhole surgery as opposed to open surgery.","Reduced recovery time: The necessary recovery time after keyhole surgery is also shorter than that following open surgery, reducing the risk of conditions associated with extended periods of bed rest such as muscle atrophy, bone loss and pneumonia. Given the small size of the incision, scarring is also significantly reduced.","Good to know: There are, however, disadvantages of keyhole surgery. The primary drawback is that, due to its complex nature, keyhole surgery can often take longer to perform than open surgery, therefore also requiring a longer period under general anesthesia.[7]",Keyhole surgery FAQs,"Q: Can I have keyhole surgery on the knee?
A: Yes, a type of keyhole surgery called an arthroscopy can be used to diagnose and treat problems in the knee. The technique can also be used on the ankles, elbows, shoulders, wrists and hips. An arthroscopy is generally considered to be a safe procedure, though, like any surgical procedure, it does come with some risks.[8]","Q: What is the recovery time for keyhole surgery?
A: The recovery time for keyhole surgery differs from case to case, depending largely on the reason why the procedure has been carried out. If keyhole surgery has been used to diagnose a condition, a person will normally be able to recover within five to seven days. If keyhole surgery has been used to treat a condition, recovery can take between 2 and 12 weeks, depending on whether the surgery was minor or major.[9]"

Most commonly the cancer affects the glottis, or vocal chords, where a tumor may develop. Less common sites of laryngeal cancer include the areas above and below the vocal chords, which are called the supraglottis and subglottis areas. The condition leads to hoarseness of the voice, coughing, foul breath, and swallowing difficulties.",Risks,"The most common risk factors for this condition are smoking and excessive alcohol consumption, especially in combination. A throat infection caused by the sexually-transmitted human papilloma virus (HPV) can harm the cells of the voice box, leading to this type of cancer. Gastroesophageal reflux disease, where contents of the stomach are regurgitated, can irritate the lining of the voice box, increasing the risk of laryngeal cancer.",Symptoms,"Typical symptoms include vocal hoarseness, sore throat, ear pain, persistent coughing, and halitosis. Difficulties swallowing may occur due to a tumor which restricts the throat's passageway.",Diagnosis,"The diagnosis consists of evaluating a person's lifestyle habits and carrying out a physical examination. X-rays, CT or MRI scans may be carried out and a biopsy (tissue sample) is often taken.",Treatment,"Treatment depends on the size and type of cancer, and whether it has spread. This information indicates the 'stage' of the cancer. Treatment involves surgery to remove the cancer and may be radiotherapy or chemotherapy or a combination of both. The treating doctor can give the best advice as to treatment on an individual basis.",Prevention,"Quitting drinking and smoking may prevent tumor development. People undergoing treatment who stop drinking and smoking may be able to prevent a second tumor from developing.

,,,,,,,,,,What is late Lyme disease?
,,,,,,,,,,What is late Lyme disease?,"Lyme disease, also known as Lyme borreliosis, is caused by an infection with the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi. This bacteria is disseminated through tick bites. Infected ticks usually bite small mammals, who do not develop any kind of infection from the bacteria. When humans are exposed to B. Burgdorferi from a tick bite, however, they can develop Lyme disease.[1]","People who work outside or spend time in woodland areas, where there is greater potential for exposure to tick bites, are most at risk of infection.",Lyme disease is a condition which progresses in stages:,"
A person will initially develop early localized lyme disease, in which the bacteria have not yet spread through the body. At this stage, which generally has its onset days or weeks after the tick bite, a person’s symptoms will usually include a fever, fatigue, and a rash, called the Erythema Migrans rash,[2] which has a distinctive bulls’ eye shape and affects around two thirds of people who develop Lyme disease. See this resource for more information on symptoms and treatment of early localized Lyme disease.
If early localized Lyme disease is not successfully treated with antibiotics, such as doxycycline, in time, it will develop into early disseminated Lyme disease, spreading to other areas of the body. If this occurs, other oral or intravenous antibiotics will be needed; oral antibiotics will be used in cases which are considered less severe. See this resource for more information on symptoms and treatment of early disseminated Lyme disease.
If Lyme disease is not diagnosed in either of these early stages, and is not treated effectively with antibiotics,[3] the bacteria that cause LD can spread throughout the body from the site of the tick bite, resulting in late disseminated Lyme disease, or late lyme disease. The onset of symptoms and complications of late disseminated Lyme disease is usually around 6-36 months after the original infection.
","Good to know: People affected by late lyme disease may develop other subtypes of late lyme disease, such as post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS) or chronic Lyme disease.","Symptoms of late Lyme disease may include joint pain (arthritis), skin changes, musculoskeletal or neurologic complications. Like the less severe forms of Lyme disease, late Lyme disease can be treated with antibiotics, although medical opinions differ about the appropriate length of an antibiotic treatment course.[3] Regardless, most people recover well, although some symptoms associated with late Lyme disease, such as fatigue, may persist for some time following treatment.",People experiencing possible symptoms of late Lyme disease can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.,Risks,"Lyme disease is caused by bacteria called Borrelia Burgdorferi. These bacteria are spread through tick bites from infected black-legged ticks. A person’s risk of contracting Lyme disease, and, by extension, late Lyme disease, is increased by spending time outdoors in wooded areas where there is greater risk of exposure to these bacteria from ticks, and/or by living with domestic animals such as cats and dogs who may bring ticks infected with B. Burgdorferi into the home.","No type of Lyme disease can be passed from person to person, so there is no risk of infection between humans.","Although anyone can develop Lyme disease, it tends to be slightly more common in children and older adults. It is possible to minimise the risk of infection from Lyme disease in all people by checking the body for ticks, particularly after spending time in woodland areas or heaths. To remove a tick:[4]","
Use a pair of fine-tipped tweezers to grasp the tick where it meets the skin’s surface.
Pull the tick upwards steadily, without twisting or jerking it.
Try to remove the whole tick at once, including the mouth parts. If the mouth parts of the tick break off when the body of the tick is removed, remove them separately.
Clean the skin thoroughly with soap and water or rubbing alcohol after the tick is entirely removed.
Dispose of the tick without crushing it between the fingers, as this can result in contracting Lyme disease.
","Treating Lyme disease promptly with antibiotics, as soon after showing symptoms following a bite from an infected tick as possible, can help to reduce the likelihood of developing late disseminated Lyme disease.",Symptoms,Late Lyme disease usually develops 6-36 months after a person first receives the causal infectious tick bite.,"The symptoms of late Lyme disease differ from the earlier stages. In North America, joint pain and swelling is very common. In Europe, skin changes are more common. These skin changes consist of swelling, redness and thinning of the skin on usually one hand or one foot. Other symptoms of LLD may include arthritis, weakness of the facial muscles, heart palpitations and aching muscles.","Although some people may develop neurologic problems, these are rare, but may include:","
Lack of stamina and fatigue
Tingling and numbness in the hands and feet
Confusion
Memory problems
Difficulty concentrating
Headaches
","When a person develops neurologic complications from late Lyme disease, these may result in a diagnosis of chronic neurologic Lyme disease or neuropsychiatric Lyme disease, depending on the nature of the complications that they experience:","
Symptoms of chronic neurologic Lyme disease may include: chronic encephalopathy (cognitive inefficiency), polyneuropathy, or leukoencephalitis.
Symptoms of neuropsychiatric Lyme disease may include: myelitis (inflammation of the spinal cord), meningitis (inflammation of the brain’s enveloping membrane), cranial neuritis (inflammation of the cranial nerves), painful radiculitis (inflammation of the nerve roots), encephalopathy, encephalitis (inflammation within the brain) and/or encephalomyelitis (inflammation of the brain and spinal cord).
","Both chronic neurologic Lyme disease and neuropsychiatric Lyme disease can be treated with antibiotics. The type, dosage and course of antibiotics used will depend on the specific needs of the person affected, and the symptoms they are experiencing.",People experiencing possible symptoms of late Lyme disease can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.,Post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS),"In post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS), certain symptoms of Lyme disease return, weeks, months or even years after early (localized or disseminated) or late Lyme disease has been treated. PTLDS is sometimes also called chronic Lyme disease, although, somewhat confusingly, the term chronic lyme disease can also be interchangeably applied to persistent cases of late Lyme disease.","The key difference between PTLDS and late Lyme disease is that, in cases of PTLDS, there is no detectable active infection within the body, despite the presence of symptoms.","Many symptoms of PTLDS are similar to those of late Lyme disease, and include:[5]","
Fatigue
Numbness and joint pain (arthritis)
Neurologic difficulties such as impaired memory and concentration
Depression
Widespread musculoskeletal pain
","People with PTLDS often report that their symptoms lessen and intensify over time.[5] A tailored treatment approach is needed to address the specific symptoms of PTLDS that a person experiences, on a case-by-case basis.",Diagnosis,"The diagnosis of late-stage Lyme disease can be very difficult, and is usually made by a specialist in infectious diseases. The diagnosis can be confirmed if the affected person has had the characteristic 'bull's eye' rash and has lived or worked in areas where ticks are present, or with a blood test.",Treatment,"Treatment for late Lyme disease is different from treatment for early Lyme disease. When the condition is in its early stages, e.g. when the Erythema Migrans rash is present, a short course of antibiotics may be sufficient to stop the bacterial infection spreading to other parts of the body.",Late Lyme disease often requires antibiotic treatment over a period of up to 28 days. Sometimes these antibiotics must be administered intravenously (through a drip).,Prevention,"Avoiding tick bites by using insect repellents and protective clothing is important to prevent this condition, especially in areas which are known to have Lyme disease.

This scar tissue replaces the normal, healthy liver, and causes the liver to become less effective. This causes problems with blood flow through the liver and interferes with the liver's other functions. There are many possible causes of liver cirrhosis, but the most common causes are hepatitis, fatty liver disease, and long-term, heavy alcohol use. Diagnosis may involve multiple tests to investigate the remaining ability of the liver and the cause of the damage. Treatment involves managing the underlying cause and preventing further damage to the liver. It is important to reduce or stop drinking alcohol, and to keep to a low-protein diet. There is no cure for liver cirrhosis, but good management can slow down the scarring process and stop the condition from progressing.",Risks,"The liver has many functions, and acts to break down (metabolize) many substances that we eat and drink (alcohol and some medications, for example), produces substances for digestion (bile), stores sugar for future use, and produces proteins to help with other bodily functions, such as blood clotting. The most common causes of liver cirrhosis are long-term, heavy alcohol use and long-term viral hepatitis B or C. Other causes include inflammation caused by autoimmune diseases (where the immune system mistakenly attacks the liver or the bile ducts), or the excessive storage of iron (hemochromatosis) or fat (fatty liver disease) in the liver. Some medications can also cause this condition. This condition is common. Liver cirrhosis most commonly affects older adults, and people with other medical conditions. Obesity is also a risk factor.",Symptoms,"The typical symptoms include tiredness, itchy skin, tremor, a loss of appetite, weight and muscle loss, yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice), small spider-shaped blood vessels on the skin, and swelling of the legs and abdomen. As the condition progresses, people may become confused, forgetful and drowsy. The symptoms of liver cirrhosis occur when the liver is scarred and not able to let blood flow freely through or perform the functions that it should. For this reason, symptoms usually only occur in the later stages of cirrhosis.",Diagnosis,"The diagnosis is made by a doctor assessing symptoms, doing a physical examination and doing a blood test to investigate the liver function and possible underlying causes, such as the hepatitis virus, or signs of inflammation in the body. In many cases, an ultrasound or CT scan of the liver is also necessary. In some cases, a small sample of the liver (a biopsy) may be taken to investigate the underlying cause.",Treatment,"The treatment depends on the causes of liver cirrhosis and the stage of the liver damage at the time of diagnosis. Common measures include reducing alcohol intake, taking lactulose and eating a low protein diet. If there is an underlying cause, it should be treated or managed. Other procedures may be needed to investigate or treat the complications. The last resort in cases of total liver failure is liver transplantation.",Prevention,Reducing alcohol intake can help to prevent many cases of liver cirrhosis. Preventing hepatitis B or C infections can also help to prevent this condition. Maintaining a healthy weight is also helpful.,Other names for liver cirrhosis,"

,,,,,,,,,,What is lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage?
,,,,,,,,,,What is lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage?,"Lower gastrointestinal tract bleeding is a condition in which there is bleeding from the lower part of the digestive system, specifically the large bowel, the rectum or the anus. The main symptoms are either fresh red blood passed from the anus or maroon-colored bowel movements. Massive bleeding from the lower gastrointestinal tract is a medical emergency. Elderly people and people with a history of diverticular disease, inflammatory bowel disease and colon or rectum cancer develop this condition more commonly. The treatment depends upon the cause of the bleeding, but almost always includes replacement of fluid and blood and, if possible, finding the source and stopping the bleeding.",Risks,"There are many possible causes for lower gastrointestinal tract bleeding. Conditions that cause small amounts of bleeding are hemorrhoids, anal fissures and some sexually transmitted diseases. Conditions which can cause larger bleeds are bowel cancers (cancer of the colon, rectum or anus), some bowel infections (such as food poisoning), diverticular disease, blood vessel malformations inside the bowel and inflammatory bowel diseases (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease). People who take medications to thin the blood have an increased risk of a large bleed from the bowel. Elderly people are more commonly affected by this condition than younger people.",Symptoms,"The most common symptom is bright red blood passed from the anus or in the stool. Other symptoms may include abdominal pain, dizziness, a fast and pounding heart, weakness, confusion and collapse, depending upon how much blood is lost.",Diagnosis,"Diagnosis of the cause of the bleeding is based upon a person's medical history, laboratory findings and looking inside the bowel via endoscopy (using a long flexible camera through the mouth or anus to look at the bowel). In severe cases of blood loss and emergency, the diagnostic evaluation is only done after the person has been resuscitated and the bleeding has been stopped.",Treatment,"Treatment depends on the amount of blood loss and the cause of the bleed. The cause should be investigated and treated to avoid further bleeding. If there has been a small bleed, these can be managed with medical or endoscopic therapy. If there has been severe blood loss, treatment includes hospitalization and resuscitation of the affected person. This may require fluids through a drip or blood transfusions, in addition to monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, etc. People who have large bleeds may need emergency surgery to find and treat the cause of the bleed.",Prevention,People who take medications to thin the blood and who have a risk of bleeding from the bowel should have their blood clotting times carefully monitored. Receiving early diagnosis and treatment for conditions that can cause bleeding from the bowel may help to prevent some cases of lower gastrointestinal tract bleeding.,Other names for lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage,"

,,,,,,,,,,What is Lyme disease?
,,,,,,,,,,What is Lyme disease?,"Lyme disease (LD), also known as Lyme borreliosis, is a condition caused by an infection with the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi, which is spread through the bites of infected blacklegged ticks.","The World Health Organisation classifies LD as an infectious or parasitic disease. People who work outside or spend time in woodland areas are most likely to be affected.  In the United States, about 30,000 cases of Lyme disease are reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention every year.",Subtypes of Lyme disease,There are three subtypes of Lyme disease.,"Early LD tends to cause symptoms in one location first, this is called localized Lyme disease, and then spreads slowly through the body. This is called disseminated Lyme disease.","The third type of LD, late Lyme disease tends to be slightly more common in children and older adults.",Symptoms,"The symptoms of Lyme disease may differ, depending on whether a person has early LD or late LD. The trademark feature of Lyme disease is the erythema migrans rash, a distinctive skin irritation shaped like a bull’s eye. Its presence is proof of LD. This rash usually appears at the site of a tick bite, but can appear elsewhere on the body.",Good to know: A tick bite itself is not an indication of Lyme disease.,Early LD,"In localized LD, the erythema migrans rash takes the form of an inflammation, surrounded by a circular border of non-irritated skin, followed by a final, circular border of irritated skin. It can increase to up to 30 centimetres in diameter and can be painful or itchy.","The rash appears on average 11 to 18 days after the tick has detached or was removed. It is possible to have more than one bull’s eye rash on the body, but it is also possible to contract LD without developing the rash, which only appears in 60 to 80 percent of people who have been infected with LD.","Besides the rash, the symptoms at the onset of Lyme disease may be similar to flu. Early symptoms of LD include:","
Aching muscles
Cold flushes
Fatigue
Fever
Painful joints
","As the bacteria begin to spread, a person can develop disseminated LD. This usually occurs if the early symptoms of LD are not spotted or treated and the infection continues to be present in a person’s body for 1-4 months.[1]","Symptoms of disseminated LD may include more rashes appearing on other parts of the skin to accompany the initial, circular rash at the site of the tick bite and painful, swollen joints. More rarely, affected people may experience neurological problems at this stage, such as difficulty concentrating. Feeling unwell? Get a free symptom assessment by downloading the Ada app.",Late LD,"Late Lyme disease usually develops 6 to 36 months after the infectious tick bite. Later symptoms can vary from person to person, but include further pain and swelling in the joints. Although some people may develop neurological problems, these are rare. They may include tingling or numbness in the hands and feet.[2]","Weeks or months after infection has occurred, people may also experience complications with their central nervous system.",Read more about Late Lyme Disease »,Causes,"Lyme disease is primarily transmitted through the infectious bites of immature blacklegged ticks called nymphs, which feed during the spring and summer months. Ticks wait in grass and plants and cling to the fur or clothing of animals or humans as they pass by. They then bite into the skin, where they anchor themselves firmly and begin feeding. Ticks must be attached for at least 36 to 48 hours before the Lyme disease bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi can be transmitted.","Although ticks can feed anywhere on the body, they prefer thin-skinned areas which are more easily punctured such as the groin, armpits and behind the ears. The bacterium that causes a person to develop Lyme disease is also carried by adult ticks, but they tend to be easier to spot than nymphs and are likely to be removed before infection occurs.","Lyme disease is not thought to be spread by human-to-human contact. For example, people cannot get infected by close bodily contact with somebody who is suffering from Lyme disease.[3] Although animals can contract LD, there is no evidence that it can be passed on to a human from an infected animal, without the involvement of a tick. However, domestic pets, especially dogs, can bring humans into contact with LD by carrying infected ticks in their fur.",Diagnosis,"If an individual experiences symptoms which include the bull’s eye rash and their history includes a tick bite or possible exposure to ticks, these details are usually sufficient on their own to make a clinical diagnosis of Lyme disease. Most people who fit this description begin treatment without waiting for the results of any blood tests taken.","However, the flu-like symptoms of LD are also symptoms of many other conditions including flu itself, chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and relapsing fever. For this reason, in cases where the erythema migrans rash is not present, blood tests will be necessary to rule out other conditions and to diagnose Lyme disease.",Diagnostic tests,"Blood tests for Lyme disease work by identifying the levels of various antibodies in the blood. Where LD is present, the levels of antibodies in the blood rise in order to combat the infection. The Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) test is usually the initial test performed to screen for Lyme disease. However, it is not always accurate, and it is important to remember that a negative result does not necessarily rule out the presence of LD, as it can take antibodies 6-8 weeks after infection to appear in blood tests.[4]","A positive ELISA test should be followed by a supplementary Western blot test. This test can detect two different classes of antibodies that the body produces as it reacts against the different molecules, or “antigens”, which are part of the Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria that cause LD.","Good to know: The body produces IgM antibodies as a first response to LD, so a positive test can be used to make an early diagnosis. One problem with testing for IgM antibodies is that a false positive result is a likely possibility. It can take 4-6 weeks for the body to produce IgG antibodies in large enough quantities for the Western blot test to detect them, so it is not possible to make an early diagnosis of LD by testing for IgG antibodies. However, tests for IgG antibodies tend to be more accurate.",Read more about Blood Test Results »,Treatment,"Most cases of Lyme disease can be treated with oral antibiotics. These most commonly include amoxicillin, cefuroxime or doxycycline. Early treatment of LD is most likely to be successful and the majority of people who are diagnosed promptly with LD, and treated early, recover well. However, a small number of people continue to present symptoms despite using antibiotics.",Monitoring Recovery,"After being prescribed antibiotics for Lyme disease, it is advisable to closely monitor one’s symptoms as they improve in order to ensure that the recovery process is underway. It is advisable to visit the doctor and to repeat blood tests for IgG antibodies to confirm that the Lyme disease has been treated effectively.",Prevention,"Ticks are most active in the warmer months (April to September) but it is advisable to take precautions against Lyme disease throughout the year, particularly in areas where it is prevalent. The most effective precaution to take against LD is to minimise contact with ticks. When spending time outside, avoid wooded and brushy areas with high grass. If people must spend time outside, walking in the center of trails where the grass is flatter can reduce the chances of contact with infected ticks.","It is also advisable to use a repellent containing 20 percent DEET or more in order to protect clothing and exposed skin from ticks. It is advisable to choose a repellent that lasts for several hours. Take care to avoid the eyes and mouth when applying it. On clothing, use products containing the insect-repellent chemical permethrin at a strength of 0.5 percent. Clothing which already contains the protective permethrin can be purchased, and the effect may last longer.","After spending time outside in long grass, a person should check for ticks and ask family or friends to check any areas they can’t see, such as behind the ears. If a tick is found on the body, it is advisable to remove it as soon as possible. Rapid removal of a tick can prevent infection with LD.",To remove a tick:[5],"
Disinfect the site where the tick has attached with rubbing alcohol
Use tweezers with pointed ends to hold the tick close to where it enters the skin
Pull the tick out slowly and carefully
Disinfect the site of the tick bite again
","Pets can be vaccinated against Lyme disease and treated to prevent ticks from hiding in their fur. Although pets cannot pass LD on to humans directly, these measures are helpful for minimising exposure to infected ticks.",Complications,"In rare cases. it is possible, for a person to develop further medical conditions after the onset of LD, sometimes months or years after the infection itself has cleared up. Complications are usually a consequence of untreated or late LD and the result of the infection being present within the body for an extended period of time. Conditions which a person affected by LD is at risk of developing may include:",Arthritis,"This condition characterized by painful swelling in the joints can appear weeks or months after the onset of LD. It is much more likely for people who have been affected by LD to develop Lyme arthritis, which can be treated with antibiotics and anti-inflammatories, than systemic arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis.[6]",Read more about Arthritis »,Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (ACA),"This inflammatory skin condition is characterized by red, swollen skin, which is particularly likely to affect the extremities of the body, such as the hands and feet. Over time, the continual inflammation of ACA causes skin tissue to be lost. However, in the early stages, this condition is treatable with antibiotics, including penicillin and doxycycline, and the changes to the skin are reversible.[7]",Bannwarth syndrome (BS),"Also known as nervous system Lyme disease, this is a neurological condition in which intense nerve pain radiates out from the spine. Recent research suggests that effective antibiotic treatment of early LD can significantly reduce the likelihood of developing BS.[8]",Chronic Lyme Disease Complex (CLDC),"It is possible for Lyme disease to develop into Chronic Lyme Disease Complex (CLDC). This is unlikely to occur if LD is diagnosed and treated early. CLDC is more commonly associated with late lyme disease. In cases of CLDC, Lyme disease infection co-occurs alongside other conditions with similar symptoms. These include autoimmune conditions such as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and fibromyalgia, a rheumatic condition typified by muscle and joint pain. To treat CLDC, it is necessary to identify and treat each condition involved.",Lyme Disease FAQs,"Q: Is Lyme disease curable?
A: Yes. The earlier a diagnosis is made, the easier it is to treat Lyme disease and its symptoms. Although diagnosing and treating LD becomes more complex as it progresses due to worsening of the symptoms and the possibility of developing other concurrent conditions, LD can be completely cured at any stage.","Q: Is there a vaccine for Lyme disease?
A: There is not currently a vaccine for Lyme disease available for humans. The first vaccine for Lyme disease, called Lymerix, was released in 1998. It was withdrawn after four years in response to public outcry following unsubstantiated claims linking the vaccine to arthritis. A new vaccine for LD is being developed by Valevna, a French biotech company, but it will not be available for 6 or more years.","The vaccine will mimic the function of the formula currently used to prevent animals from contracting LD, which works by neutralising the B. burgdorferi bacteria within the feeding tick. Pets that have been vaccinated against Lyme disease may still pass infected ticks on to humans from their fur.","Q: Where in the US am I most at risk of contracting Lyme disease?
A: The blacklegged tick, or deer tick, Ixodes scapularis, spreads the disease in the northeastern, mid-Atlantic, and north-central United States. The western blacklegged tick (Ixodes pacificus) spreads the disease on the Pacific Coast.",Check the risk factor of encoutnering ticks carrying lyme disease throughout the U.S. with this interactive map »
,,,,,,,,,,What is malaria?
,,,,,,,,,,What is malaria?,"Malaria is a serious disease which occurs almost exclusively in the tropics and subtropics. It is caused by infection with a parasite called Plasmodium, which is spread through the bite of female mosquitoes that carry it.[1]","The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that about half the world’s population were at risk in 2016.[2] Most cases of malaria occur in those who live in or have visited sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. However, the Eastern Mediterranean, Oceania, and the Americas are also risk areas.","In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report approximately 1700 cases of malaria annually.[3]","The main symptoms of malaria are fever and a flu-like illness. If a person experiences symptoms of malaria after traveling to an affected area (see map of affected areas, they should consult a medical practitioner as quickly as possible. Try the Ada app for a free initial symptom assessment.","Left untreated, malaria can cause severe complications, leading to a poor prognosis with a high mortality. However, it has an excellent prognosis if diagnosed early and treated appropriately.","Malaria is typically preventable with the use of antimalarial drugs when a person visits endemic areas. Mosquito repellent and insect nets should be used during the night, since the mosquitoes that transmit malaria bite mainly during the night.","Symptoms usually appear within a couple of weeks of becoming infected, but can sometimes take much longer. The period may vary, depending on host factors and the causative species, so malaria disease should be considered as a possible diagnosis in all cases of fever within a year of visiting an affected area.",Symptoms,"Malaria symptoms typically manifest within a few weeks after infection, although the host’s previous exposure or immunity to malaria will affect their symptoms and incubation period. In some cases, the parasite may lie dormant and not cause symptoms for many months, even up to a year after traveling in an area where malaria is present.",Main symptoms of malaria,Signs and symptoms of malaria typically include:[4],"
Piques of very high fever
Shaking chills
Sweats
","Paroxysms – sudden recurrences or attacks of fever, shaking chills and sweats together – occur every 24, 48 or 72 hours, depending on the parasite species. Each paroxysm lasts approximately one to two hours and occurs in three successive stages. The first is characterized by shivering and a feeling of cold. This is followed by a pique of high fever. After the patient experiences excessive sweating to an unusual degree, the temperature goes back to normal or even below normal. Sometimes, in early infection, patients don’t experience this, but may have several piques of fever during the day.","
Headache
Cough
Fatigue
Arthralgia (painful joints)
Muscle pain
",Less common symptoms of malaria,"In some cases, a person may also experience:[5]","
Abdominal pain
Lethargy, meaning sleeplessness or deep unresponsiveness and inactivity
Nausea
Vomiting
Diarrhea, especially in children
Anemia
Jaundice
Shortness of breath
Loss of appetite
","Life-threatening complications can result from malaria if it is left untreated or if it is malignant malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum. This may include respiratory distress, liver failure, kidney failure and shock, as well as very serious brain and central nervous system problems.","Often, abdominal pain occurs in the first week or two of malaria. This is caused mostly by inflammation of the liver and spleen. Large numbers of red blood cells become sequestered in the liver and the spleen, as well as other major organs. If the spleen becomes very enlarged, it may rupture, causing massive internal bleeding that requires emergency treatment.[6]",Causes,"Human malaria is caused by a parasite known as Plasmodium, specifically species P. falciparum, P. malariae, P. ovale, P. vivax and P. knowlesi, which is normally spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. Just one bite from an infected mosquito can lead to malaria.","Only female Anopheles mosquitoes can transmit malaria. When a mosquito bites an infected person, it takes in a small amount of blood, which contains microscopic malaria parasites. About one week later, when the mosquito takes its next blood meal, these parasites mix with the mosquito’s saliva and are injected into the person being bitten.","Not every infectious mosquito bite will result in malaria. The number of parasites each mosquito carries influences the chance of successful malaria infection. Some mosquitoes can be highly infected, making them particularly likely to pass on the disease.[7]","Mosquito-transmitted malaria also depends on certain climatic features, such as sufficiently high temperatures and humidity for Anopheles mosquitoes to multiply and survive. This is why malaria occurs in warmer, tropical areas.","Hot weather also encourages human behavior that can increase contact with Anopheles mosquitoes between dusk and dawn, the time when malaria-causing mosquitoes mostly bite. Examples include outside activities like camping, sleeping outside and also wearing light and short clothes that lead to more skin being uncovered and more exposed to a possible mosquito bite.","In rare cases, malaria transmission can occur from person to person, without requiring passage through a mosquito. This can only occur through blood, such as in the following scenarios:","
Organ transplants
Blood transfusions
Needle sharing
From mother to unborn child in congenital malaria
",Cases of infection secondary to transfusion of infected blood are extremely rare.[8],Types of malaria,"Each species of malaria varies in the typical length of time after the infecting mosquito bite before symptoms appear. Parasites can linger, grow and multiply  in the liver cells for months before they are released into the red blood cells. This is known as the incubation period.","Once in the blood, each malaria parasite species varies in its typical replication cycle length, during which newly replicated parasites erupt out of red blood cells. This results in regular spikes in fever, known as the fever cycle.","Some species of Plasmodium can cause relapses, because they have dormant stages in the liver, known as hypnozoites, that can activate and invade the blood several months or years after the infecting mosquito bite.",Malaria is also divided into two general types: benign malaria and malignant malaria. Benign malaria is typically milder and easier to treat.,The five main species of the Plasmodium parasite that cause malaria in humans are:,"P. falciparum: This is a malignant form of malaria and can be very severe, and sometimes fatal. Normally the incubation period is about 7 - 14 days, but can be up to one yesr. The fever cycle is at first irregular and usually daily. After about a week the fever returns every third day. This type of malaria does not cause relapse.","P. Vivax: This is mostly benign. Normally the incubation period is about 12 - 17 days, followed by a fever that recurs every third day. This species can cause relapse.","P. ovale: This is mostly benign. Normally the incubation period is about 15 - 18 days, followed by a fever that recurs every third day. This species can cause relapse.","P. malariae: This is mostly benign. Normally the incubation period is about 18 - 40 days, followed by a fever that recurs every fourth day. If untreated, this species can remain in the body causing symptoms for many years.","P. knowlesi: This is a malignant form of malaria and can be very severe, and sometimes fatal. Normally the incubation period is about 9 - 12 days, followed by a fever that recurs every day. this species of malaria does not cause relapse.","Good to know: Plasmodium knowlesi is often misdiagnosed under the microscope as Plasmodium malariae. However, it can be more serious, sometimes causing malignant malaria, and has a relatively high risk of mortality.[9]",Diagnosis,"As there are no symptoms that are specific to the disease, it is important that a person see a doctor and mention the possibility of malaria if they experience fever within a year of visiting an affected area.","Other infections may present with similar symptoms, such as typhoid, HIV, dengue fever, meningitis/encephalitis or viral hemorrhagic fevers ,in which blood vessels rupture. Most missed malarial infections are wrongly diagnosed as nonspecific viral infections, influenza, gastroenteritis or hepatitis. Try the Ada app for a free symptom assessment.",A doctor will typically review the person’s medical history and ask about recent travel to tropical climates. A physical exam will also be performed to determine if the spleen or liver is enlarged.,"A blood test may be done to confirm the diagnosis. After examination in a laboratory, blood samples can generally show:","
If malaria is present
What type of malaria is present
If the infection is caused by a variation of the parasite that is resistant to certain types of drugs
If the infection has caused anemia
If the infection has affected any vital organs
",Accurate diagnosis of malaria presence and the type of Plasmodium infection is important:,"
To ensure appropriate treatment for the best outcome
Due to concerns of increasing drug resistance, which is widespread in malaria-endemic areas
","Sometimes malaria does not show up immediately in a blood test. This happens especially in pregnant people, where the parasite can be present in high numbers in the placenta, without being apparent in the rest of the body.[10] If no malaria is seen in the blood sample, another blood test may be taken a couple of days later.",Treatment,"It may be possible to treat malaria at home if symptoms are mild. However, if the infection is caused by Plasmodium falciparum or there are any complications, the person will generally need to be treated and monitored in a hospital.","If promptly diagnosed and treated, most people will make a full recovery from malaria. However, treatment may make a person feel weak and tired for several weeks after the infection is gone.",There are various types of antimalarial medication available. Which medication is prescribed to treat malaria will depend on:,"
The subtype of plasmodium parasite causing it
Whether any antimalarial medications have been taken when traveling
The severity of symptoms
","More than one type of medication, or an alternative, may be given if a person experiences side-effects, or if the infecting parasite shows resistance to a particular drug.","Many of the same medications used to prevent malaria can also be used to treat the disease. However, if you've taken a particular malaria pill to prevent malaria, you shouldn't take the same one to treat it.","Certain types of malaria, such as Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale, have stages in the malaria life cycle where the parasite can live dormant in the liver for several months, even years, and reactivate later, causing a relapse of malaria. If found to have one of these types of malaria, a person will usually be given medication to prevent relapse.",It is possible to be given emergency treatment to take along if traveling to remote places and use it to treat suspected malaria until medical care is available.,Prevention,"Malaria prophylaxis is the preventive treatment of malaria. The main ways to prevent malaria are through taking malaria pills, known as chemoprophylaxis, and avoidance of mosquito bites.","There is currently no malaria vaccine available, though development efforts for several malaria vaccines are ongoing.","The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends five principles, known as the ABCDE of malaria prophylaxis:[11]","
Awareness. When travelling to a malaria-affected area, be aware of the risk of malaria, the malaria incubation period, the possibility of delayed onset and the main symptoms.
Bite prevention. Use an effective mosquito repellent, such as diethyltoluamide (DEET), and mosquito nets when sleeping.
Chemoprophylaxis. Take antimalarial drugs when appropriate, starting at least two weeks before entering a malarious area and following the drug’s daily or weekly dosing interval.
Diagnosis. Seek immediate diagnosis and treatment if a fever develops one week or more after entering an area where there is a malaria risk and up to three months or even later, after departure from a risk area, although symptoms rarely occur after more than three months.
Environments. Avoid being in or near mosquito breeding areas, such as swamps or marshy areas, particularly in late evenings and at night.
","Most frequently, travelers develop malaria because they have not taken their antimalarial medication correctly, either because some doses may have been missed, or the tablets were not taken for the advised length of time before entering or after leaving a malaria-affected area.","Malaria prophylaxis drugs are usually well tolerated, but can result in side-effects in some people. The most common side-effects experienced include nausea and diarrhea. Some antimalarial drugs can increase sun sensitivity, making it important to use a higher factor sunscreen, while others might lead to sleep problems and headaches.","Antimalarial medication is not always 100 percent effective, which is why it is important to practice bite prevention when in a malaria-endemic area. Diethyltoluamide (DEET) is the most effective insect repellent, and if the product contains between 10 to 30% DEET it can be used on babies and children over two months of age, and when breastfeeding.[12]. Concerning adults, higher concentrations of DEET may have a longer repellent effect. However, concentrations over 50% provide no added protection.[13]",Other behaviors that will reduce the risk of a person being bitten include:,"Using mosquito nets while sleeping, especially those treated with insecticide, ensuring that there are no holes.",Covering up any bare skin if outside after sunset.,"Sleeping in an air-conditioned room, as the lowered temperature discourages mosquitoes.","Putting screens on doors, windows and other possible mosquito entry routes.",Spraying the bedroom with an insecticide before sleep to kill any mosquitoes that may have entered during the day.,Using an electrically-heated device to vaporise a tablet containing pyrethroid insecticide in the room at night.,Good to know: Herbal and homeopathic remedies have not been shown to be effective for malaria prevention or treatment and are not recommended.,FAQs,"Q: Is malaria contagious?
A: No, malaria transmission cannot take place in the same way as a cold or the flu, because the malaria parasite is not found in an infected person’s saliva. Nor can it be sexually transmitted. The only way that malaria can spread from one person to another is through blood, as with blood transfusions, organ transplants, needle sharing or if it is acquired by an unborn child from its mother. Otherwise, malaria is normally transmitted by being bitten by a female Anopheles mosquito, infected through a previous blood meal taken from an infected person.","Q: Is there a malaria vaccine?
A: The world’s first malaria vaccine, known as RTS,S, is being piloted in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi, starting in 2018. However, it is not otherwise available yet. Despite many decades of research and development efforts, there is currently no commercially available malaria vaccine. The complexity of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium, makes development of a malaria vaccine very difficult.","Q: Can a person acquire immunity to malaria through exposure?
A: After repeated attacks of malaria, a person may develop semi-immunity. Such a person can often still be infected by malaria parasites, but may not develop severe disease. After time spent away from a malaria-endemic area, this acquired immunity will gradually disappear. Many cases of malaria in travelers are acquired by people who have moved to an area without malaria, visited the malaria-affected areas where they grew up and not taken antimalarial tablets because they assumed they were still immune.","Q: Is malaria caused by a virus or bacteria?
A: Malaria is not caused by a virus or bacteria. Malaria is caused by a parasite known as Plasmodium, which is normally spread through infected mosquitoes. A mosquito takes a blood meal from an infected human, taking in Plasmodia which are in the blood. About a week later, the mosquito takes another blood meal and injects the Plasmodia into the body of another person, spreading the malaria disease."

Although the illness is unpleasant, most people make a full recovery. However, in certain cases, serious complications can develop.","Vaccination programs have had a huge impact on reducing the number of cases of measles.[1] However, measles is still a common disease in many other countries.[2]","The measles virus is contained in water droplets and most often spread through the nose or mouth of an infected person. Physical contact, coughing and sneezing are the most common causes of infection spreading.","People with measles typically experience flu-like symptoms, such as a runny nose and coughing,  fever, feeling generally unwell and a gradual rash. The symptoms of measles usually get better within seven to 10 days.",Types of measles,"There are two types of measles. Although they share some of the same symptoms, they are caused by different viruses:","
Standard measles, sometimes known as red measles, or hard measles, is caused by the rubeola virus.
German measles, also known as rubella, is an entirely separate illness caused by the rubella virus and is usually a milder infection than standard measles.[3] For more information, read this resource on rubella.
",Symptoms of measles,"Once an affected person has caught measles, the virus multiplies in the back of the throat and begins to spread gradually throughout the body.",It can take up to 10 days for an infected person to show symptoms. The most common early symptoms are: [4][5][6][7],"
Cold-like symptoms, such as a runny nose, sneezing and coughing
A high temperature or fever
Sore, red eyes
Sensitivity to light
Grey-white spots inside the cheeks, mouth and throat
Nausea
Tiredness
Lack of appetite
Aches and pains
","Around three to four days after the first symptoms, a skin rash will normally begin to appear. The rash is perhaps the most noticeable symptom of measles and is recognizable by:[6][7][8]","
Red-brown spots, either flat or slightly raised, that may join together to form blotches
Spots usually start on the head and neck and then gradually spread downwards through the rest of the body
The rash may turn pale when pressed at first, but will gradually fade and become non-blanching (stays red when pressed)
Slight itching
","Generally, the rash takes two to three days to cover the body and then another few days to fade, beginning on the head and disappearing in the same order in which it appeared. As other symptoms begin earlier, affected people usually feel most unwell on the first or second day that the rash is present.","Symptoms of measles usually begin to appear on average around seven to 14 days after  becoming infected.[6] However, affected people are usually infectious four days before to four days after the measles rash appears.[4]","Overall, most people with measles feel better within seven to 10 days of first experiencing symptoms. On occasion, a dry cough may persist after all other symptoms have gone.[8] Check your symptoms with the Ada app.","During the measles infection, the immune system builds up a resistance to the virus. It is therefore highly unlikely for anyone to have measles more than once in their lifetime.[8]",Causes of measles,"Measles is caused by a viral infection, and is highly contagious. It is estimated that around 90 percent of unvaccinated people close to someone who is in the contagious phase of measles will also become infected.[9]","Measles is transmitted in a similar way to colds and flu, i.e. breathing in the airborne water droplets coughed or sneezed out by an infected person. Although physical contact, coughing and sneezing are the most common causes of infection spreading, it is also possible to contract measles simply by breathing in contaminated air, or touching a contaminated surface and then breathing in the droplets.",The measles virus can live for up to two hours on surfaces and in an airspace.[9],Risk factors,"Measles is very rare in countries that have a vaccination program. In recent decades, the number of measles cases in the United States has significantly declined due to the introduction of the Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccine. However the disease has not been completely eradicated. In 2017 there were 120 reported cases of measles in the United States according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The majority of these cases were in people who were unvaccinated.[10]","Unvaccinated people are at most risk of contracting measles, in particular people with a weakened immune system. Unvaccinated pregnant women should also be especially cautious. Pregnant women with measles may develop serious complications that can result in miscarriage or premature labor. [7] See more below.",Diagnosing measles,"A doctor will usually look for a combination of characteristic symptoms such as a skin rash, fever and cough to diagnose measles.","However, a blood or saliva test is the only way to definitively confirm the diagnosis.[11] These tests check for Immunoglobulin M and Immunoglobulin G antibody levels, both of which may indicate the current or past presence of measles.[12]","If measles is suspected, it is important to call the surgery and tell the staff when making a doctor’s appointment. Because measles is very contagious, it is common for medical professionals to ask initial questions over the phone to help them decide how likely the diagnosis of measles is, and whether a trip to the surgery can be avoided. If an appointment with a doctor is necessary, the doctor may make special arrangements, such as a home visit, in order to reduce the risk of infecting other patients.[13]","If you are worried that you or someone you know may have measles, You can start a free symptom assessment with the Ada app at any time.",Treatment of measles,"There is no specific medicine used to treat measles. Because the disease is viral and not bacterial, antibiotics are not effective.",Treatment for measles instead aims to manage and ease the symptoms until the body’s natural immune system can clear the infection. Symptoms usually improve within seven to 10 days. Typical treatment recommendations include:[8][14][15],"
Plenty of bed rest to help boost the immune system
Drinking lots of fluids such as water, fruit juices and herbal teas, to prevent dehydration and help ease a sore throat; alcohol and caffeine should be avoided
Closing curtains and dimming lights to control sensitivity to light
A humidifier or sitting in a steamy bathroom to help ease a cough or sore throat
Ibuprofen and paracetamol/acetaminophen may be recommended to relieve fever and aches
Vitamin A supplements may be recommended to people suffering from measles, particularly children, in order to lessen the severity of the condition and the risk of complications[16]
","Please note that ingesting a high amount of vitamin A can result in a condition called hypervitaminosis A, or vitamin A toxicity. This is usually the result of a person taking high-dose dietary supplements, so always discuss vitamin A supplementation with a doctor before starting.[17]",Prevention of measles,The best precaution against measles is to be vaccinated against it.,Vaccinations,"The most common vaccine is the MMR vaccine, which immunizes against measles, mumps and rubella. According to CDC, two doses of the MMR vaccine are about 97 percent effective at preventing measles, and a single dose is about 93 percent effective.[1]","In countries with a vaccination program, the MMR vaccine is first administered to children around 12-15 months, with a second, booster dose when they are between four to six years old.[1] For babies travelling to countries with a high rate of measles infection, the first dose of the vaccine may be given as early as six months old.[18]",Adults can request the measles vaccine from their doctors if they have never been immunized.,"There is a further vaccine called MMRV, which protects against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (chickenpox). Currently this vaccine is only licensed for use in children aged between 12 months and 12 years old.[1]",Travelling and the risk of measles,"The measles virus remains common in many countries in the world, particularly in parts of Africa and Asia.[2]  Measles outbreaks in the United States most often occur when returning travellers spread the disease to other unvaccinated people, having contracted the illness in another country.[19]",It is best to take precautions to reduce the risk of contracting and spreading the measles virus when travelling internationally. The most important of these is to receive the MMR vaccination prior to travelling. Children can receive their first dose at six months old when travelling internationally. Other ways to help prevent illness include:[20],"
Wash hands frequently, ideally with soap and water, or alternatively hand sanitizer
Cover the mouth and nose with a tissue, not the hands, when coughing and sneezing
Avoid contact with people who are sick, especially close contact such as kissing, hugging and sharing cooking or eating utensils
Do not touch the eyes, nose or mouth unless hands are fully clean
",Good to know: Always contact a doctor when feeling seriously unwell.,Side-effects of the MMR vaccine,"The benefits of the MMR vaccine outweigh the risks, but side effects are possible. These commonly include:[21]","
Aching, sore arm from the shot
Short term, mild rash
Temporary stiffness in the joints. Most commonly affects teenage and adult women
Fever
",Less common side effects include:[21],"
Fits caused by fever, such as febrile seizures. These are rare and are not a sign of any long-term health problems
A temporary low platelet count which affects the blood’s ability to clot. Again this is rare and usually goes away without treatment or any long-term issues
Swelling of the glands in the cheeks, neck or jaw for a couple of days
","In very rare cases, a person may have a serious allergic reaction after a dose of the MMR vaccine. For this reason, anyone who has had an allergic reaction to any component of the vaccine may be advised not be vaccinated.[22] If there are any concerns about the MMR vaccine and allergies, it is important to discuss these with a doctor.","Despite concerns that the MMR vaccine may cause autistic spectrum disorders, multiple studies have shown there is no link between being vaccinated and developing autism.[23]",Isolation,"Due to how contagious the measles virus is, it is important to limit the risk of spreading the infection to others. Symptoms of measles usually begin to appear on average around seven to 14 days after first becoming infected.[6] However, affected people are usually infectious four days before to four days after the measles rash appears.[4]","For this reason, people with this condition should stay home from the moment symptoms begin to appear until four days after the rash disappears.[9]","Friends, family, co-workers, classmates, carers and teachers should be notified if they may have come into contact with someone who has measles during the infectious period. This is particularly important if they are a vulnerable person.","Contact with vulnerable people such as young children, pregnant women and those with weakened immune systems should be especially limited.",Complications of measles,"In the majority of cases, people with the measles virus make a full recovery after around seven to 10 days and will experience no further complications. However serious complications which can be life-threatening do occur.","Measles complications can happen at any age, but are more likely to occur in certain groups of people, such as:[8][11]","
Children younger than five years old
Children who have a poor diet or are malnourished
Children with a weakened immune system, such as those with leukaemia or HIV
Adults older than 20 years of age
Pregnant women
",Common complications,"There are a number of common complications that may arise from measles, such as:[24][25][26]","
Vomiting and diarrhoea, which can lead to dehydration
Eye infection, conjunctivitis
Ear infection, otitis media, which can lead to earache
Inflammation of the voice box, laryngitis
","While these symptoms can be distressing, they are not usually serious. However, affected people should see a doctor if they are concerned.",Uncommon complications,More uncommon complications from measles may include:[24][25][26],"
A squint, if the measles virus affects the nerves or muscles of the eye
Fits caused by fever, such as febrile seizures
Inflammation of the liver, known as hepatitis
Infection of the airways and lungs, such as pneumonia, bronchitis or croup, which can be very serious
",Rare complications,"In rare cases, measles can lead to:[27][28][29][30]","
Serious eye disorders such as infection of the optic nerve, which can lead to blindness
Infection of the membranes around the brain and spinal cord, such as viral meningitis
Inflammation of the brain, or encephalitis, affects roughly 1-3 out of every 1,000 cases
Central nervous system disease known as subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) which can develop several years after contracting measles. This disease can be fatal but is extremely rare, occurring in roughly two per 100,000 cases
","If any concerning symptoms develop, always contact a doctor.",Measles and pregnancy,"Pregnant women who contract measles have an increased risk of developing serious complications which can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth or premature labor.[31]","The CDC guidelines recommend that the MMR vaccine be administered to unvaccinated women no less than a month before becoming pregnant.[32] The MMR vaccine not only protects against measles, but also against mumps and rubella. Rubella can also cause severe problems during pregnancy, including birth defects, miscarriage and stillbirth.[21]",Good to know: Women who are planning a pregnancy should discuss vaccination options with their doctor.,Measles FAQs,"Q: Are measles and German measles the same?
A: No. Measles, also known as rubeola, and German measles, also known as rubella, are two completely separate illnesses. They do have certain symptoms in common, including:","
Cold-like symptoms such as a runny nose, sneezing and coughing
A high temperature or fever
Sore, red eyes
A skin rash
","They are also both spread in the airborne water droplets coughed or sneezed out by an infected person, as well as prevented by the MMR vaccine. However, they are caused by different viruses and have different specific symptoms, complications and treatments.","Q: What does the measles rash look like?
A: The measles rash is characterized by red-brown spots that may join together to form blotches. It is usual for spots to first appear on the head and then gradually spread down throughout the body. For some people the rash will be slightly itchy, but this is not always the case. Generally the rash takes around two to three days to cover the body and then another few days to fade in order of appearance.","Q: Is there a vaccine against measles?
A: Yes. The MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps and rubella, and two doses of the vaccine have been shown to be around 97 percent effective at preventing measles. Children aged between 12 months and 12 years old may also get the MMRV vaccine, which immunizes against measles, mumps,  rubella and varicella (chickenpox).","Q: What is the treatment for measles?
A: Because there is no medication that targets the measles virus, most treatment focuses on managing and easing the symptoms of measles.","Q: What precautions can be taken against measles?
A: The only way to prevent measles is by having a vaccination. Measles is very contagious, so it is important for people with this condition to stay home from the moment symptoms begin to appear to four days after the rash disappears.",Other useful preventative methods include:,"
Washing hands frequently, ideally with soap and water or hand sanitizer
Covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing and sneezing
Avoiding close contact with people who are sick

,,,,,,,,,,What is melanoma?
,,,,,,,,,,What is melanoma?,"Melanoma is the most serious type of skin cancer and develops from melanin-containing cells. These cells produce the pigment that gives color to the skin and hair. People with fair skin, red or blond hair, and who spend a lot of time in strong sunlight are at high risk for developing melanoma. Avoiding prolonged sun or other UV radiation exposure is important in preventing this condition. The diagnosis is confirmed by taking a sample of the spot (biopsy) for testing. Treatment depends on the stage at diagnosis. If diagnosed early, surgery may cure this condition. If diagnosed at a later stage, chemotherapy is often necessary.",Risks,Melanoma occurs when abnormal melanin-producing cells grow uncontrollably. These abnormal cells destroy the normal cells around them and can spread through blood or lymph channels. The main cause of melanoma is prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight or tanning salons. People with fair skin and red or blond hair are at especial risk of developing melanoma. There are also some rare conditions which run in families that make people more likely to develop melanoma. The highest rates of skin cancer in the world are in Australia and New Zealand. Melanoma is most common in middle-aged and older adults. Men are slightly more likely than women to develop this condition.,Symptoms,"Early signs of melanoma include a change in an existing mole or the development of a new, dark spot, mole or freckle on the skin. These moles are often asymmetric, have an irregular border, and they may change in color, get bigger or change in some other way. Hidden melanomas may occur on feet, palms of hands, in fingernail beds or in the mouth, eye, digestive or urinary tract.","People concerned that they are displaying signs of melanoma should seek medical attention. In addition, the free Ada app can be used to carry out a symptom assessment.",Diagnosis,"The diagnosis is made by a doctor assessing symptoms, examining the skin and taking a sample of the mole (a biopsy) to investigate for melanoma.",Treatment,"The treatment depends on the size of the cancer and whether it has already spread by the time of diagnosis, as well as the affected person's general health and personal preferences. In early stages of melanoma, it can be treated by surgery to remove the suspect mole. If the melanoma has spread beyond the skin, there are different treatment options such as surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy or biological therapy. The treating doctor can give the best advice on treatment in individual cases.",Prevention,"Prevention includes wearing sunscreen, avoiding the sun at the middle of the day and wearing protective clothes. Avoiding the use of solariums and tanning beds also helps to prevent skin cancer. Early diagnosis is very important for the best possible recovery outcome. People at risk of melanoma should have their skin checked by an experienced doctor regularly."
,,,,,,,,,,What is melatonin?
,,,,,,,,,,What is melatonin?,"Melatonin is a natural hormone which plays an important role in regulating the body’s circadian rhythm, otherwise known as the sleep/wake cycle.[1] Melatonin production is at its highest at night, typically between the hours of 11pm and 3am, dropping off significantly during the day. Melatonin production is also affected by the seasons, with the hormone being produced earlier in the darker winter months and later in the summer.[2]","In this way, melatonin helps to promote sleep at night and wakefulness during the day. The hormone’s function has led it to be nicknamed the sleep hormone.",How is melatonin produced and controlled?,"The majority of melatonin is produced in the pineal gland of the brain, though smaller quantities are also made in other tissues of the body. Melatonin is released into the bloodstream and circulates throughout the body, where its presence is detected by receptors. These receptors then signal to the body that it is time to sleep.","The production of melatonin is controlled by the circadian clock, which is located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei region of the brain. This is a tiny region of the brain in the hypothalamus, situated directly above the optic chiasm. The suprachiasmatic nuclei region is connected to the pineal gland through the nervous system.","The circadian clock is regulated primarily by light received through the eyes, which tells it when and when not to signal for melatonin production. The circadian clock conveys to the rest of the body whether it is light or dark outside; information which accordingly sets off various functional processes, including the body’s sleep-wake timing, blood pressure regulation, seasonal reproduction (reproductive cycle) and core temperature regulation.[3]","The body’s natural production of melatonin occurs when it is dark. Accordingly, melatonin levels typically begin increasing in the late evening, and maximum melatonin levels are usually reached between 2:00 and 4:00 a.m. Levels of melatonin decline slowly thereafter, becoming barely detectable in the daytime. This cycle repeats every day; the body’s rhythm is kept to an approximate 24 hour cycle by the circadian clock, which roughly correlates with the light/dark cycle of nature.[3]",What are melatonin supplements used for?,"Melatonin is also available in synthetic form, typically as a capsule. Synthetic melatonin is able to reset the body’s circadian rhythm and bring on feelings of tiredness, making it a commonly prescribed supplement for those experiencing:[4][5]","
Insomnia or jet lag
Benzodiazepine or nicotine withdrawal, facilitating a calmer tolerance of the withdrawal period
Cancer adjuvant care, a care-plan alongside treatment for cancer[6]
Headaches, as a preventative medication
Shift-work disorder
Sleep disorders
Thrombocytopenia, which may be caused by chemotherapy
Winter depression
Dyskinesia, a disorder in which people experience uncontrolled, involuntary movement
","Taken as a supplement, synthetic melatonin mimics the effects of the naturally produced version of the hormone. Supplementary melatonin is principally used by those experiencing insomnia, those with jet lag and those with delayed sleep phase syndrome, i.e.when the circadian rhythm is out of sync with the day/night cycle. However, it is important to note that the use of melatonin supplements does not guarantee the ability to sleep, and that a healthcare professional should always be consulted before beginning use.[7]","Good to know: Melatonin will not be prescribed to treat insomnia if a cause can be identified. In all cases where a medical, mental or environmental cause for insomnia is discerned, the causal issue(s) will be addressed as a first line treatment.",When not to take melatonin supplements,"Pregnant or breastfeeding women should not take melatonin, nor should those with an autoimmune disorder, a seizure disorder or depression. If a person is younger than 20 years old, the use of melatonin supplements should be discussed with a doctor prior to taking them. Those with high blood pressure, impaired liver function or diabetes should always consult a doctor before beginning to use melatonin.","Melatonin may react with other medications. For this reason, it is always recommended that a person check with their doctor before using melatonin supplements at the same time as taking other medications. In particular, a person should be closely monitored in case of drug interactions if they are using medications including:","
Anticoagulant (anti blood-clotting) medication
Concurrent immunosuppressive treatment
Any medication used on a chronic (long-term) basis
","People using melatonin should stop if the supplement does not work after a week or two of use. Generally, melatonin supplementation should be considered a short-term rather than a long-term solution to problems with sleep. People experiencing recurrent or severe sleeping disorders should seek the advice of a doctor, who will present other therapeutic options in the event that melatonin supplementation does not provide relief.",How to take melatonin,"In the US, melatonin is available without a prescription from pharmacies and health food stores. In the EU, a doctor’s prescription will be required in all cases. Elsewhere, a doctor’s prescription may also be required to ensure that the supplement is safe for the person to use and to diagnose any possible underlying conditions that are causing sleep problems.","Doses of melatonin should be somewhere between 0.5 and 5 mg, with research suggesting that there is little difference in the effectiveness of a larger dose. Most melatonin supplements come in slow/release form, meaning they work gradually throughout the night, mimicking how the body naturally releases the hormone.","It is generally recommended that melatonin should be taken one or two hours before bed, though some people will experience a wave of tiredness roughly 20 minutes after taking it. If used to combat jet lag, the supplement should be taken close to bedtime at the destination.[8]",Melatonin side-effects,"Melatonin is generally described as safe when taken in the short-term. Despite this, the advice of a doctor should always be sought before beginning to use the supplement.",Possible side-effects of taking melatonin supplements may include:[9],"
Drowsiness during the day (daytime fatigue)
Abdominal cramps
Decreased alertness
Irritability or feelings of depression (transient)
Dysphoria in patients who are already depressed
Stomach pain
Headache
Dizziness
","Immediate medical attention should be sought if any of the following signs occur, as they may be signs of an allergic reaction:","
Difficulty breathing
Hives
Swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat

,,,,,,,,,,What is Menopause?
,,,,,,,,,,What is Menopause?,"The menopause transition period, which is also known as perimenopause, is the period of time during which a woman moves beyond her childbearing years and enters menopause. Menopause itself is when a woman has not had a menstrual period for more than one year. During menopause transition, women often experience a change in menstrual cycles, vaginal dryness, hot flashes or flushes and sleeping problems. The experience of the symptoms can vary greatly from mild to unbearable and can cause severe interference with daily activities and sleep. The perimenopause usually lasts around five years. The symptoms are often treated with lifestyle changes and hormonal therapies. Although the symptoms should eventually peter out as one enters the menopause, troublesome symptoms which persist can be managed, and should be discussed with a doctor.",Risks,"Menopause is a time when a woman's body is losing the ability to become spontaneously pregnant. The ovaries stop releasing eggs and producing the hormones necessary for the menstrual cycle, estrogen and progesterone. For these reasons, a woman stops having menstrual periods. The menopause is confirmed once a woman has not had a period for a year. The time leading up to this point is characterized by unstable hormone levels, which produce the symptoms of the menopause transition period. The average age at the beginning of this time is between 45 and 47 years of age, but this can be earlier in women who smoke, who have had their uterus (womb) or ovaries removed, who have been through chemotherapy and in women who have medical conditions which affect the ovaries. Menopause is usually complete by 51 years of age. Women with family members who experience menopause early or late are likely to follow this pattern.",Symptoms,"The most typical symptom of the menopause transition are menstrual periods which are different from the regular menstrual cycle. These may become heavier or lighter, and tend to come further apart until they eventually stop. Other common symptoms include hot flashes or flushes, sweating at night, difficulty sleeping, weight change, mood swings, a low mood, a low sex drive, vaginal dryness and tender breasts. Symptoms can vary from mild to unbearable and can cause severe interference with daily activities.",Diagnosis,"The diagnosis is usually made based on the symptoms and change in the menstruation pattern in a woman of the appropriate age. A diary of the details of any menstrual bleeding may be helpful in making the diagnosis. If there is any doubt, blood tests may be taken to measure hormone levels.",Treatment,"The treatment of this condition involves managing the symptoms. Many women find that lifestyle changes, such as taking regular exercise, reducing caffeine and alcohol intake, eating a healthy diet and staying social help to manage symptoms. Hormonal therapies may help with the irregular bleeding and the mood symptoms. This includes hormone replacement therapy. Using lubricants or estrogen-containing creams may help with vaginal dryness. There are many herbal remedies that are marketed as being helpful for peri-menopausal symptoms. Some of these can interact with other medications, so it is wise to discuss the use of these with a doctor or pharmacist.",Other names for menopause,"

,,,,,,,,,,What is Mesothelioma?
,,,,,,,,,,What is Mesothelioma?,"Mesothelioma is a type of cancer that develops in the layers of tissue that surround the
internal organs (the mesothelium). The lining of the lungs (the pleura) is the most commonly
affected area, but the cancer can also develop in the tissue in the abdomen that surrounds
the digestive organs (the peritoneum), the lining of the heart and the tissue that surrounds
the testicles.[1]","Mesothelioma typically develops slowly, manifesting itself in symptoms such as extreme
tiredness, fever, shortness of breath, chest pain, a persistent cough, nausea, abdominal
pain, swelling or weight loss.[2]","The majority of mesothelioma cases are a result of exposure to asbestos, a once common
building material that is now known to be highly toxic. The more exposure to asbestos, the
greater the risk of the cancer. Roughly five times more men than women are diagnosed with
mesothelioma and around half of all cases occur in individuals 75 years of age or older. It
is a fairly rare type of cancer, with around 3,000 reported cases in the USA each year.[3]","There is no known cure for mesothelioma and treatment can be challenging. Life expectancy,
therefore, is often limited to between several months and several years after the initial
diagnosis.",Symptoms of Mesothelioma,"The symptoms of mesothelioma can be difficult to detect due to their similarity the symptoms
of other, more common, conditions. They can also be very slow to develop, making them
potentially unnoticeable in the condition’s early stages. In some cases, they can take
decades to fully develop.",Symptoms can also differ according to the cancer’s location.,Pleural mesothelioma in the tissue lining of the lungs has symptoms that include:,"
Shortness of breath
Lower back or chest pain
Fatigue
A persistent cough (especially if coughing up blood)
Difficulty swallowing
Fever or sweating (particularly at night)
Sudden weight loss or lack of appetite
","Peritoneal mesothelioma in the abdomen tissue that surrounds the digestive organs has symptoms
that include:","
Abdominal swelling and pain
Breathing difficulties
Nausea
Sudden weight loss or lack of appetite
Constipation or improper bowel function
Fever or sweating (particularly at night)
","Pericardial mesothelioma, a rare form of the condition that develops in the lining of the
heart, has symptoms that include:","
Heart palpitations, heart murmurs or an irregular heartbeat
Difficulty breathing
Chest pain
Coughing
Fever and night sweats
",Causes of Mesothelioma,"Although there are rare instances where no link can be found, the vast majority of all cases
of mesothelioma — some 80 percent — are directly related to exposure to asbestos. The link
between asbestos and mesothelioma, therefore, is considered indisputable by healthcare
professionals.","Asbestos is a naturally occurring mineral which has been known of since antiquity and mined
since the early 19th century, though it was only in the latter half of the 20th century that
it became a common building material. Although researchers discovered a link between asbestos
and cancer as early as the late 1940s, the extent of its dangers did not become common
knowledge until much later and it was only banned in the USA in 1989.[4]","Those with a history of long-term exposure to asbestos are most at risk of being diagnosed
with mesothelioma. However, cases have also been reported of mesothelioma in individuals
who were only exposed to the material for a relatively short period of time (1-3 months).",Environmental Exposure,"Statistically, populations living close to naturally occurring asbestos deposits are at far
higher risk of developing mesothelioma than those who do not. Naturally occurring asbestos
is found across the globe, including in the United States, Canada and South Africa. Forty
percent of the world’s asbestos is mined in Russia, with large amounts also mined in China
and Kazakhstan.","When the earth is mined or construction work undertaken, the asbestos is disturbed, releasing
particles into the air and exposing large areas to the risk of inadvertent inhalation.",Occupational Exposure,"Working with asbestos, particularly in the construction and mining industries, has been
proven to vastly increase one’s risk of developing a number of diseases, including malignant
mesothelioma. Despite asbestos now being banned, the risk of exposure still exists when
dealing with buildings built before the banning order took effect. The use of masks and
artificial respiratory systems has been shown to greatly reduce the risks posed.",Diagnosing Mesothelioma,"Due to the symptoms of mesothelioma also being common to less serious conditions, as well
as to other pleural and peritoneal malignancies, the cancer can often be difficult to diagnose.
Those with a history of exposure to asbestos who display the symptoms should therefore make
this clear and seek out a doctor specialising in mesothelioma.","Full diagnosis of the cancer can take months, from first identification through initial
imaging tests to confirmation through biopsies. Due to the rarity of the disease, patients
displaying the symptoms will first be asked to recall their full work history and any
exposure to asbestos. Prolonged exposure is grounds for clinical suspicion of mesothelioma
and will significantly hasten the diagnostic process.",Imaging,"If an initial chest X-ray shows signs of pleural thickening — a tell-tale sign of mesothelioma
— a PET scan, CT scan, MRI, or a combination of the three will follow. These scans give
doctors a detailed look inside the body, allowing them to identify the presence of any
malignant cancer. If a large amount of fluid is found in the pleural cavity, it is common
for doctors to drain the fluid using a syringe and test it for cancerous cells. Though it
does not completely exclude the presence of mesothelioma, if no cancerous cells are found,
the chances of the disease are greatly reduced.",Blood tests,"Like all types of cancer, mesothelioma releases abnormal substances into the bloodstream.
While there is no test that can definitively identify these substances and diagnose
mesothelioma, various biomarker tests, or assays, are available and can be useful to the
diagnostic process.",Biopsy,"The presence of malignant mesothelioma can only be fully confirmed with a full biopsy. To
do this, a pathologist will examine a tissue sample, or in the case of suspected chest cancer
or abdomen cancer, this may involve a thoracoscopy or laparoscopy, respectively. These
procedures are types of minimally invasive surgery, wherein surgeons are able to remove a
tissue sample through a small incision in the abdomen or chest.",Mesothelioma Treatment,"There currently exists no cure for mesothelioma, however there are treatments available
that can help prolong life expectancy and improve quality of life. These typically involve
a combination of surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. In some cases, emerging or
experimental treatments may also be prescribed.[5] The direction that treatment will take
is largely determined by the maturity of the cancer, the age and general health of the
patient, as well as how far the cancer has spread (this will depend on what stage the cancer
has entered – see the prognosis section for more details on the stages of mesothelioma).",Surgery,"If the cancer has been detected early, surgery will involve fully removing the tumor(s) —
or, depending on where the cancer is located — the mesothelial lining, lymph nodes or sections
of the lungs or heart. However, if the cancer is more developed, this may be impossible and
surgery will typically be paired with chemotherapy or radiation therapy — a treatment route
that has proven effective in combatting malignant mesothelioma.",Chemotherapy,"Courses of chemotherapy have proven the most effective treatment method in combatting
mesothelioma in controlled testing. Chemotherapy drugs work by halting the multiplication
of cancerous cells in the body and thereby stopping the spread of the disease and the
development of tumors.[6] There are more than 100 types of chemotherapy drugs currently
available on the market, with each differentially effective in treating patients in different
stages of the disease.","Chemotherapy can result in significant side-effects, most commonly vomiting, stomatitis,
exhaustion and diarrhea. Typically, the chemotherapy drugs are administered intravenously
in cycles of several weeks followed by a short recuperation break. To lessen the side-effects
and more directly target specific tumors, doctors have pioneered a method of localized
chemotherapy whereby the drug is injected straight into the tumor itself. While this method
has proven effective in combatting early-stage mesothelioma, it is not suitable for tackling
the disease once it has spread from its original location.",Radiation Therapy,"If the cancer remains localized and the patient is in otherwise good health, radiation
therapy, in conjunction with surgery and sometimes chemotherapy as well, can be an effective
treatment method. It has been shown to significantly improve a patient’s prognosis, however,
it is considered a radical option that can result in serious side-effects. These can include
pneumonitis; a condition that involves the inflammation of the alveoli (air sacs) in the
lungs that can sometimes be fatal in itself.",Emerging Treatments,"If surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy prove ineffective, some patients may be
eligible for emerging treatments in their clinical trial stage. These treatment options are
those that have not yet been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and are
therefore considered experimental.","One such promising treatment method is immunotherapy. This type of treatment harnesses the
power of the bodies own immune system, training it to specifically attack the cancerous
cells and leave the healthy cells alone. This is done by introducing antigens (substances
the body recognises as toxic) into the body, stimulating and improving the immune system’s
response to their presence. When used in addition to conventional methods, immunotherapy
has seen some success in improving life expectancies.","Across the world, numerous clinical trials are taking place on new drugs for treatment of
mesothelioma. These new, cutting-edge drugs promise to advance the treatment of the cancer
and improve the prognosis of patients. New drugs take years to be tested and become
available on the market, though patients with particularly severe cases may be eligible
for inclusion on these clinical trials.",Mesothelioma Prognosis,"Mesothelioma spreads quickly and is difficult to treat, meaning the prognosis is generally
poor. Roughly 50 percent of people with mesothelioma in one location are expected to survive
until the first anniversary of their initial diagnosis. Life expectancy after diagnosis,
however, depends on a multitude of factors, most significantly the stage at which the cancer
is detected and the age of the patient.","People diagnosed with mesothelioma before the age of 50, and women in particular, can expect
a better prognosis. Whether the cancer is pleural or peritoneal is also a factor. The prognosis
can be improved by maintaining a healthy lifestyle, seeing a mesothelioma specialist and
receiving a second opinion.[7]","Long-term survival, however, is rare, with around one in every 10 people surviving for over
5 years after diagnosis.[8]",Doctors generally describe the growth and spread of mesothelioma using the idea of four stages:,"
Stage 1: The earliest stage of the cancer when it is still localized to one area of
the body, with no spread to the lymph nodes or metastasis. If mesothelioma is detected
during this stage the patient has the most treatment options and can expect a higher life
expectancy.
Stage 2: The cancer is still largely localized to one side of the body, but may have
spread to the lymph nodes or other organs. Aggressive treatment options may still be an
option.
Stage 3: The cancer is still localized to one side of the body, but has spread further,
including to the lymph nodes. Surgical treatment methods become less viable.
Stage 4: The cancer has conclusively spread to areas far beyond its origin (distant
metastases). Treatment at this stage is generally limited to easing the uncomfortable
symptoms.
",Legal Issues Related to Mesothelioma,"Many people have sought to claim compensation for the development of mesothelioma as a result
of exposure to asbestos. Since the first in 1929, large amounts of lawsuits and class action
cases have been launched, normally against asbestos manufacturers and employers.[9] In the
USA, total claims have reached billions of dollars. Despite these precedents in the courts,
as yet, the US Congress has passed no federal law on the issue.",Mesothelioma FAQs,"Q: What jobs increase the risk of exposure to asbestos?
A: People involved with construction work, demolition and home renovation are at high
risk of occupational exposure to asbestos. A full list of jobs that increase this risk can
be found here.","**Q: Where is naturally occurring asbestos found? **
A: Naturally occurring asbestos is found in many locations across the world. Asbestos
deposits can be found in most US states, with California, Arizona and Virginia having some
of the highest levels. People living close to asbestos deposits should take steps to minimize
their exposure, such as keeping windows and door closed during strong wind and thoroughly
wiping shoes before going indoors.","Q: Can mesothelioma be benign?
A: Yes. Benign mesothelioma - sometimes called multicystic or fibrous mesothelioma -
refers to non-cancerous tumors within the pleura.[10] Like malignant mesothelioma, benign
mesothelioma also largely results from exposure to airborne asbestos. However, unlike the
cancerous version, it is relatively easy to treat with surgery to remove the tumor(s).
Benign mesothelioma accounts for a tiny percentage of all mesothelioma cases, making it
very rare.","Q: Can mesothelioma be caused by smoking?
A: No. Smoking does not increase the chances of developing mesothelioma. However, exposure
to asbestos, like smoking, can also increase the risk of lung cancer[11].","Q: Is mesothelioma hereditary?
A: No. Unlike most other types of cancer, the only known cause of mesothelioma is exposure
to asbestos.[12]"
,,,,,,,,,,What is a middle ear infection?
,,,,,,,,,,What is a middle ear infection?,"A middle ear infection, otherwise known as otitis media, is a viral or bacterial infection of the air-filled cavity behind the eardrum. In most cases, a middle ear infection affects just one ear, but can also occur in both ears simultaneously. The infection can cause painful inflammation, as well as a build-up of fluid in the middle ear. Although people of any age can develop the infection, it is most common in younger children, with a high percentage of children experiencing the condition before the age of 10.[1]","In some cases, a middle ear infection may disappear without treatment. While antibiotics are only sometimes necessary to fight the infection, pain-relievers are commonly prescribed to lessen the pain caused by the condition. Further treatment options are available for recurrent middle ear infections. Complications are rare, meaning it is generally considered a non-serious condition.",There are three common types of middle ear infection:,"
Acute otitis media: This is the most common form. It is characterised by its rapid onset and often results in ear pain, fever and hearing impairment. It usually lasts for between a few days and a few weeks.
Otitis media with effusion: Once the initial infection has faded, non-infectious fluid or mucus may continue to build, resulting in pronounced hearing loss and a feeling of fullness in the ear. Otitis media with effusion can also result from a fluid build-up that was never infected. In such cases, antibiotics will often not work as a treatment method. This form often lasts longer than acute otitis media; running its course after around four to six weeks.
Chronic otitis media: An acute middle ear infection with or without effusion that does not fully disappear or repeats frequently. This can lead to a prolonged inflammatory reaction with subsequent fluid build-up and often to a tear or perforation in the ear drum. When this happens, there will also be discharge from the middle ear. Chronic otitis media can lead to long-term hearing impairment.
",Symptoms of a middle ear infection,A middle ear infection generally develops very rapidly.,Signs and symptoms in children may include:[2],"
Ear pain
Generally feeling unwell (malaise)
Fever
Muffled hearing/partial hearing loss
Fluid in the ear or yellow, clear or bloody discharge from the ears
Increased irritability, restlessness, crying and trouble feeding
Nausea, vomiting and/or dizziness
A child may excessively pull, tug or touch their ears
",Symptoms of a middle ear infection in adults may include:,"
Ear pain
Partial hearing loss/muffled hearing
Fluid in the ear (that may leak out) or yellow, clear or bloody discharge from the ears
",It is important to consult a doctor when:[3],"
Symptoms develop in a child of six months or younger
A child displays symptoms for 48 hours or more and has a temperature of 39 C (102.2 F) or more
Symptoms show no sign of improvement after two or three days
Symptoms become worse rather than better over the first few days
Discharge presents itself
Symptoms are experienced by a person with an underlying health condition, such as cystic fibrosis or congenital heart disease, which could make complications more likely
",Causes of a middle ear infection,"Middle ear infections are caused by viruses and bacteria, often resulting from other conditions (flu, cold, allergy) that can cause blockage and swelling of the eustachian tubes that connect the throat and the middle ear. When this happens, a vacuum is created, allowing germs and fluid from the throat to enter the middle ear. A middle ear infection develops when bacteria or viruses grow in this fluid.[4]","Children are more susceptible to middle ear infections than adults, partly because their eustachian tubes are narrower, so they are more easily blocked. Children also have relatively larger adenoids than adults. These are masses of tissue situated at the point where the nose bends into the throat[5] that are vulnerable to infection, swelling and inflammation – when this happens, they can block the eustachian tubes and cause a middle ear infection.",Diagnosing a middle ear infection,"A doctor will generally be able to diagnose a middle ear infection by considering a person's symptoms and looking for specific signs. Using an otoscope (a lighted wand-like instrument), a doctor will be able to look into the ears, throat and nose for any signs of infection.[5] While the area around the eardrum will most likely be red and swollen, this will normally only be noticeable upon examination with an otoscope. The ear itself will generally not be red or swollen.","In some cases, especially when the condition is predicted to have taken the form of otitis media with effusion, a pneumatic otoscope may be used to confirm a diagnosis. This instrument pumps air into the middle ear and measures the resulting pressure changes. If little response is felt, this indicates the presence of fluid in the ear.[3]","To further confirm a middle ear infection diagnosis, a doctor may order a number of further tests, including:","
Tympanometry: By testing the movement of the eardrum, this test can provide an indirect measure of pressure and fluid build-up behind the eardrum
Acoustic reflectometry: By emitting sound into the eardrum and measuring the response from the eardrum, the amount of fluid in the eardrum can be measured. The more sound is reflected by the eardrum, the more fluid is present in the middle ear
Tympanocentesis: If a middle ear infection is persistent, this test can be used to determine what kind of bacteria is present. This is done by piercing the eardrum, draining the fluid and then testing the make-up of this fluid
",Middle ear infection treatment,"In many cases, no treatment is required for a middle ear infection, with the symptoms fading quickly and the infection clearing up completely in anywhere between a number of days and two weeks. However, if the symptoms are severe or the infection is persistent, treatment methods are available.",Pain relief,"Over-the-counter pain relief medication such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen (paracetamol) can be used by those experiencing a middle ear infection. When giving these drugs to children, a medical professional should be consulted first. Adults should read the instructions on the packaging closely before taking medicinal pain relief. For less severe pain, or if pharmaceuticals are not an option, a warm compress over the ear can also help relieve pain.[4]",Antibiotics,"In children, antibiotics will normally be prescribed when:","
The infection is severe
The child is younger than two years old, has an infection in both ears and has mild to severe pain and fever
The child is at risk of complications from the infection
","In cases outside of these parameters, doctors will generally wait a few days before prescribing antibiotics. Adults will typically be prescribed antibiotics when the symptoms are severe or when the infection does not disappear naturally.","When taking antibiotics, it is extremely important to follow the exact instructions of the doctor or pharmacist and ensure the full course is taken. Failure to do so can result in a recurrence of the problem and in the development of antibiotic resistance in the bacteria causing the infection.",Ear tubes (grommets),If an individual experiences persistent middle ear infections (generally defined as three episodes in six months or four in a year) then ear tubes – sometimes known as grommets – may be necessary.,"To place these, a small hole is created in the eardrum. Through this, fluid is drained and a tube is fitted to ventilate the middle ear and prevent the further buildup of fluids. Some ear tubes will naturally fall out after a number of months, whereas others are designed to be worn for longer and may require a procedure in order to remove them. Both the initial insertion and the removal are relatively straightforward outpatient procedures.",Preventing a middle ear infection,There are several ways to help children avoid a middle ear infection. They include:[6],"
Breastfeeding rather than bottle feeding
Avoiding a child’s exposure to tobacco smoke
Ensuring a child is up-to-date with their routine vaccinations – particularly the pneumococcal vaccine and the DTaP/IPV/Hib (5-in-1) vaccine
Avoiding situations where exposure to bacterial infection is a risk (group child care, for example)
Avoiding use of a pacifier
",Complications associated with a middle ear infection,"Complications from middle ear infections are extremely uncommon, but can occur, especially in very young children with a not yet fully developed immune system. These complications include:[7]","
Mastoiditis: When the infection spreads into the bones of the ear. Symptoms include fever, pain, tenderness, headache and a creamy discharge from the ear. This condition is treatable, but seeking medical attention early is important.
Cholesteatoma: A result of tissue build-up from recurrent instances of infection. If left untreated, the condition can cause serious damage. Treatment typically involves surgery.
Labyrinthitis: A condition that occurs when an infection in the middle ear spreads to the inner ear. Symptoms include dizziness, hearing loss, vertigo and loss of balance. It is treatable.
Other complications: Other possible complications include facial paralysis, meningitis and brain abscess, but these conditions are extremely rare.
",Middle ear infection FAQs,"Q: Are there any home remedies for treating a middle ear infection?
A: There are a variety of natural remedies for treating a middle ear infection. These treatment methods may provide some immediate relief, however, a doctor should also be consulted in cases where symptoms persist for more that a couple of days. Remedies include:[8]","
Salt: Heat salt in a pan, wrap it in a cloth and place the cloth against the affected ear for up to ten minutes. This should help draw out fluid from the ear and provide some relief
Garlic or onions: The antimicrobial properties of garlic and onions give them natural pain relieving qualities. Garlic can be eaten raw. Alternatively, it can be boiled and crushed, then wrapped in a cloth and placed against the ear. It can also be cooked in sesame or mustard oil until black, strained and applied to the ears in drops
Olive oil: Slightly heat the olive oil and apply a few drop to the ears
Warm compress: Heat a cloth to a bearable level and place against the outer ear
","Q: Are middle ear infections contagious?
A: Middle ear infections are not contagious or spreading. However, part of their causes, like viral infections (such as the common cold) are contagious and spread from person to person.[9]"

,,,,,,,,,,What is a migraine headache?
,,,,,,,,,,What is a migraine headache?,"A migraine headache is a type of headache characterized by a pulsing or throbbing pain in one area of the head. The intensity of the pain may be moderate or intense, and a headache attack can last anywhere between 4 and 72 hours if left untreated.[1]","The pain of a migraine headache may be accompanied by symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and sensitivity to environmental factors, such as light and sound. Some people experience neurological ‒ primarily visual ‒ disturbances, called an aura, during the migraine attack or as a sign that it is about to begin.","People of all ages can be affected by migraine headaches. According to the American Migraine Foundation, they affect more than 36 million men, women and children in the United States.[1] The World Health Organization classifies the migraine headache as a primary headache disorder, meaning that migraine headaches are not currently known to be caused by any underlying condition.[2]","In most cases, migraine headaches develop during puberty. Women are three times more likely to be affected by migraine headaches than men, because the development of headaches often relates to the hormonal changes that occur during the menstrual cycle.[3]","People affected by migraines usually experience headache attacks recurrently, on a lifelong basis after becoming initially affected. The frequency of attacks varies between people, occurring as often as several times per week in some people, and as rarely as once every few years in others.[4]",Migraines are primarily an episodic condition. This means that an affected person is at an increased likelihood of experiencing headache attacks during some time periods.,"The likelihood of experiencing headaches relates to changeable factors and triggers, such as diet, stress levels, lifestyle, hormonal changes and a person’s overall health. If somebody is affected by migraine attacks on more than 15 days per month ‒ which is the case for eight percent of all people affected by migraines ‒  this is a rare subtype of the condition called chronic migraine.[5]","Appropriate methods for providing relief for migraine headaches can vary, depending on the type of migraine headaches a person experiences. Broadly speaking, treatment focuses on reducing the frequency of migraine attacks and alleviating the symptoms of the headache episodes. Currently, there is no cure for migraine headache disorder because the pathophysiology ‒ disordered physiological processes ‒ that result in a person developing migraine headaches are not yet fully understood.[6] However, with effective treatment and management, the potential negative impact of the condition on a person’s quality of life can usually be minimized effectively.",Symptoms,The principal symptoms of a classic migraine headache ‒ also called a migraine without aura  ‒ include:[6][7],"
A sensation of throbbing, pulsing pain: this usually builds up over one to two hours and intensifies with movement or physical activity
Pain which is localized to one side of the head, which may affect the eye area but can occur anywhere in the head or neck
Sensitivity to light
Sensitivity to sound
Vision changes, such as blurred vision
Nausea and food intolerance, which may in turn cause light-headedness
Vomiting

Fatigue
Abdominal (tummy) pain
Diarrhea or constipation
Sweating
Neck pain
Fever, very rarely
","Most, but not all people affected by migraine headaches, will experience some of these symptoms in addition to the headache pain. There are many different types of migraine, and one person’s secondary symptoms may therefore be different from those experienced by another.",When to seek medical attention,"Some symptoms which accompany a migraine can indicate a more serious condition requiring urgent medical attention, such as a stroke or meningitis. These include:[4]","
Slurred speech or difficulty speaking
A sudden, sharp pain which is unlike any pain that the person has previously experienced
Paralysis or weakness in one or both arms and/or in one or both sides of the face
A high temperature (fever), combined with a stiff neck and possible seizures, which may, but do not always, present as convulsions, as well as confusion, double vision and a rash.
",Seek urgent medical attention if a person experiences any of these symptoms.,Migraine with typical aura (MTA),"Most people have no warning signs before they experience a migraine headache attack. However, between 10 and 30 percent of people affected by migraine headaches experience additional accompanying neurological disturbances called an aura; this often results in a temporary loss of vision, or visual disturbances, such as flashing lights.[6][8] The aura often occurs just before the headache attack begins, but may occur during the attack, afterwards or on its own.",The typical migraine aura is characterized by visual symptoms including:[6][8],"
Coloured or blind spots in the field of eyesight
Sparkles, stars or flashing lights
Scintillating scotoma: an arc or band of absent vision, often with a shimmering border or zig-zag lines
Tunnel vision
Temporary blindness

If a child has one parent who is affected, they have a 50 percent risk of experiencing migraine headaches themselves. This risk increases to a 75 percent likelihood if both parents experience migraine headaches.","In adolescence, the symptoms of a migraine attack are likely to be similar to those experienced by adults. In children aged five to 10, the most common symptoms of migraine headache include:[11][12]","
A painful headache. This only occurs in some cases; other children may experience nausea and/or abdominal pain as the primary characteristics of their migraine attacks. When headache occurs, it is characterized by throbbing and may affect the whole of the head or neck, rather than just one area, as in adults.
Nausea. This may be more intense than the head pain. Frequent car-sickness* can be a sign that a child is prone to experiencing migraine headaches.
Vomiting. This may mark the end of the migraine attack, reducing other symptoms.
Needing to sleep. This may mark the end of the migraine attack, reducing other symptoms.
",Other commonly experienced symptoms of migraine headache in children include:,"
Abdominal cramps
Sensitivity to light and/or sound and/or smells

Teary, red eyes
Dark circles under the eyes
Paleness
Swollen nasal passages
Dizziness
Anxiety
Depression
Problems concentrating
Thirst
Dehydration: excessive sweating and/or decreased urination
Diarrhea
","In children, migraine headaches usually come on more suddenly than in adults, with symptoms, including the headache pain (when present), reaching their full intensity after around 15 minutes. Migraine attacks in children can last for between 30 minutes and several days, if left untreated.[13] If you think that your child, or a child you that know, may be affected by migraine headaches, you can get a free symptom assessment by downloading the Ada app.","Always seek medical attention if a child experiences one or more headache attacks in order to establish what type of headaches they are experiencing and whether their headaches are primary headaches, as in headaches caused by a headache disorder itself or secondary headaches. Secondary headaches are headaches which are caused by another health problem which will then need to be identified and treated. Causes of secondary headaches in children may include:","
Infection, in the head or elsewhere
Injuries to the head or neck
Sinusitis
Meningitis
High blood pressure
","If children younger than five display headache symptoms, it is especially important to keep a diary of their headache symptoms and to identify headache triggers, as they may be unable to verbalize accurately what they are experiencing. Young children who experience episodes of dizziness, or who were affected by colic as a baby, are at greater risk of developing migraine headaches in later life than other children.[12]",Childhood periodic syndromes,"A variant of migraine headache which specifically affects children, childhood periodic syndromes, usually involve attacks of pain or vomiting which are classified as possible precursors to migraine by the International Classification of Headache Disorders. Children who experience these symptoms are usually affected episodically, and are symptom-free in between bouts. Symptoms, when present, may occur with or without headaches and may include:[14]","
Vertigo; sudden attacks accompanied by the inability to stand without support; usually affects children between ages 2-4 years
Cyclic vomiting; usually affects children around age 5
Abdominal pain; usually affects children around age 7
","In order to be diagnosed with childhood periodic syndromes, all other possible causes for a child’s symptoms, such as the possibility of any other underlying conditions, must be ruled out.",Variants of migraine headache,"There are many variants of the migraine headache. The type of migraine which a person experiences is related to the specific symptoms that they experience during headache attacks, in addition to the principal migraine symptoms.","Most people who are affected by variants of migraine headache have a previous history of migraine with aura. However, it is possible to develop a variant of migraine headache on its own. In all cases, other possible causes for a person’s symptoms, including underlying conditions, will be eliminated before a diagnosis of any variant of migraine headache is given.","Variants of migraine headaches may be characterised by particular features or triggers of the headache or aura, or by the affected person experiencing specific physical or neurological symptoms in addition to the headache. For instance, a person may experience temporary weakness or paralysis in one side of the body (hemiplegic migraine) or find that their headache attacks occur at a particular point in their menstrual cycle (menstrual migraine).",Variants of migraine headache include:,"Menstrual migraine, or hormonal headaches","Many women affected by migraines find that headache attacks occur two days prior to or during menstruation, due to a drop in estrogen levels that occurs during this period. Commonly, menstrual migraines are more severe than migraines which occur at other times in a woman’s natural cycle. Other factors which may influence the development or cessation of hormonal headaches include:[15]","
Pregnancy. Migraine attacks may get worse during the first few weeks of pregnancy, but do not pose any risks to the developing baby. Those affected should consult a doctor to ensure that any painkillers they may wish to take are safe for use in pregnancy.
Menopause. The fluctuating hormone levels that occur during menopause can cause migraines to worsen or develop, particularly as periods occur more frequently.
The combined contraceptive pill. The combined pill (containing estrogen and progesterone, or substitutes) can reduce migraines for some women and cause or worsen headaches in others. In those affected by migraines, the drop in estrogen levels during the pill-free week can worsen or bring on migraine attacks.
",Retinal migraine,"This condition is also called an ocular migraine. In contrast to a normal migraine headache, a retinal or ocular migraine is primarily an eye condition which causes a person to experience partial loss of vision in one eye, usually lasting 10-20 minutes, after which vision returns. This will be accompanied by a migraine headache, typically resulting in painful throbbing in the head on the same side as the affected eye.[16]","It is important to seek medical attention the first time a retinal migraine is experienced or suspected because loss of vision may indicate a range of more serious conditions affecting the eye, or a stroke.",Treatment for retinal migraines usually involves:[16],"
Taking medications, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs), or medications used to treat high blood pressure, as recommended by a doctor to lessen the symptoms and reduce the likelihood of the headache attacks.
Identifying and avoiding triggers, which may include internal triggers such as dehydration, stress and high blood pressure and external triggers such as strong light, changes of temperature and excessive heat.
",Hemiplegic migraine,"This is a rare subtype of migraine in which a person experiences hemiplegia: a sensation of paralysis or weakness on one side of the body as part of the migraine headache attack. The headache and sensation of paralysis or weakness may be accompanied by pins and needles, a migraine aura, fever nausea and/or vomiting.",There are two varieties of hemiplegic migraine condition:[17],"
Familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM). If a person has hemiplegic migraine headaches in their family history, their condition is believed to be hereditary.
Sporadic hemiplegic migraine (SHM). If an affected person has no family history of hemiplegic migraine headaches, meaning that the headaches are caused by a new ‒ or sporadic ‒ gene mutation.
","A hemiplegic migraine attack may be as short as one hour in duration, but may last for several days. Normally, the paralysis or weakness that features in a hemiplegic migraine attack relieves within 24 hours.[17]","Seek medical attention urgently if a hemiplegic migraine attack is suspected. Due to its rarity, it is especially important to accurately diagnose and begin treating hemiplegic migraine headaches as soon as possible, ruling out other conditions with similar symptoms, such as epilepsy.[18]","Although hemiplegic migraine headache attacks can be a particularly distressing type of migraine headache to experience or witness, they are not life-threatening. Treatment usually focuses on discerning the right course of preventative medication for each person, according to their medical history, the frequency of their headaches and their overall health.",Migraine with brainstem aura (MBA),"A migraine with brainstem aura, formerly known as a basilar-type migraine, is a rare subtype of migraine accompanied by an aura. A migraine with brainstem aura is different from a migraine with a regular aura in that the headache pain affects the back of the head, on both sides.[19] MBA headaches are believed to originate in the brainstem, at the base of the brain, above the spinal cord.[20]",People affected by MBA will experience two or more of the following symptoms during a headache attack:[19][21],"
Visual disturbances, which affect both eyes
Difficulty hearing and/or ringing in the ears (tinnitus)
Difficulty speaking
Sensations of tingling, particularly in the hands and feet
Dizziness
Loss of balance
Confusion
Vertigo
Fainting and/or loss of consciousness
","A person affected by migraine with brainstem aura may find their symptoms distressing, particularly the first time. This may cause secondary symptoms to develop, including anxiety and hyperventilation. It is important to seek medical attention promptly the first time an MBA is suspected ‒ particularly if secondary symptoms are present ‒ in order to ensure a correct diagnosis. MBA may be confused with other conditions with similar symptoms including:[20]","
Epilepsy
Stroke
Transient ischemic attack
","Treatment for MBA focuses on reducing the symptoms during a headache episode, often with the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or antiemetic medications, which are used to relieve nausea and vomiting. People affected by frequent attacks may also be prescribed preventive medication.[19]","Good to know: People affected by migraine with brainstem aura may also experience other kinds of migraine headache attacks, most commonly migraine with typical aura (MTA). If this is the case, a person will receive two separate diagnoses, e.g. MBA and MTA.[20]",Vestibular migraine,"A vestibular migraine is believed to be caused by widening of the blood vessels in the brain, including the vestibular artery, which affects the balance control system of the inner ear. For this reason, the symptoms of this kind of migraine are mainly related to balance and hearing. During an attack of vestibular migraine, people may experience:[22]","
Vertigo; this is the primary symptom of vestibular migraines
Dizziness and difficulty balancing
A sensation of pressure in the head and/or ear
Pain or nausea when moving the head, e.g. to look up or around
Difficulty hearing low, soft sounds
Tinnitus; ringing in the ears
Neck pain
","People who are affected by vestibular migraines do not always get a headache during an attack. However, a vestibular migraine attack may be accompanied by additional symptoms including:[22]","
Headache
Partial vision loss
Hazy vision
Visual disturbances such as blotches
","Treatment involves leading a healthy lifestyle, minimising contact with triggers and, for some people, taking medications to reduce the frequency and duration of headache attacks.",Causes of migraine headache,"The exact biological cause of migraine headaches is not yet fully understood, but they are believed to result from abnormal brain activity, which disrupts the normal function of nerve signals, blood vessels and chemicals in the brain.[4][23]",Triggers of migraine headache,"Keeping a diary of the circumstances surrounding migraine attacks is recommended for all affected people in order to identify their potential triggers. These can then be avoided, with a view to reducing the frequency of headaches. Triggers vary considerably between people, and somebody may grow out of particular triggers or develop new ones. Some commonly recognised triggers of migraine headaches include:[4]","
Environmental triggers. Loud noises, bright lights, flashing lights, strong smells like paint thinner, extreme hot or cold temperatures, poorly ventilated spaces.
Physical triggers. Fatigue, poor posture, lack of sleep, sudden and strenuous exercise, head and neck tension, low blood sugar.
Dietary triggers. Caffeine, alcohol, dehydration, irregular meal times, certain food additives such as aspartame and monosodium glutamate (MSG), chocolate, aged cheeses, salty foods and citrus fruits.
Emotional triggers. Stress, shock, anxiety, low mood, tension.
Hormonal triggers. Menstruation, pregnancy, menopause, the combined contraceptive pill, hormone replacement therapy.
Medicinal triggers. In particular, vasodilators and sleeping tablets. Always check the packet or consult a doctor to ascertain whether medications are associated with headaches before use.
",Risk factors,"Although anybody can be affected by migraine headaches, certain factors render a person more likely to develop the condition. These include:","
A family history of migraine headaches
Being adolescent; most people are first affected by migraine headaches during puberty
Being female; women are three times more likely than men to be affected; pregnancy and menstruation are also risk factors for developing migraine headaches
",Diagnosis,"Always seek a medical opinion the first time a migraine headache is suspected. This is vital in order to rule out the possibility that they are secondary headaches, due to other, potentially serious, underlying causes. There is no diagnostic test for migraine headaches, so a doctor will make a diagnosis by:","
Assessing headache symptoms in relation to a person’s medical history and overall health
Assessing circumstantial details related to the headache attack (or attacks), to identify potential triggers and discern how severely a person’s daily routine is affected during attacks
Noting whether the person has a family history of migraine headaches or other headache disorders
Ruling out other possible causes for a person’s symptoms, such as a brain tumor. This may involve performing imaging tests to visualise the inside of the head using a CT or MRI scanner. See this resource for more information about undergoing a CT scan of the head](/procedures/ct-scan-head/).
Performing a complete neurologic examination. This can be carried out by a GP during the initial appointment, using equipment like a Snellen chart (for eye tests) and a reflex hammer.
",A complete neurologic examination includes:,"
A motor exam
A sensory exam
A cranial nerve exam
Tests of the deep tendon reflexes, coordination and gait
Tests for signs of meningeal irritation
","Good to know: The principal purpose of all of the tests involved in a complete neurologic examination is to check whether the nervous system is impaired. A migraine headache attack, in and of itself, does not lastingly impair the nervous system. Evidence of impaired nerve function would therefore suggest the presence of an alternative underlying condition.","A diagnosis of migraine headaches will be given when all possible other causes for the symptoms that a person is experiencing have been ruled out, including other primary headache disorders. After diagnosing a person with migraine headaches, doctors will then help the affected person to devise a treatment and management plan to reduce their impact on the person’s quality of life.",Treatment,Treatment for migraine headaches focuses on:[3],"
Preventing headache attacks and reducing their frequency
Relieving the symptoms during attacks
",Treatments for preventing headache attacks,Behavioral changes that are recommended for preventing migraine attacks include:[3][4],"
Developing techniques to manage and reduce stress, such as deep breathing exercises and regular physical activity
Keeping a diary to identify migraine triggers, such as exposure to strong smells, which can then be avoided if possible
Sleeping well, and establishing a consistent sleep cycle
Staying hydrated, by drinking water and other non-alcoholic, non-caffeinated beverages throughout the day
Establishing regular meal times, and adopting a healthy, balanced diet
Devising a new medication plan with one’s doctor, if any medications which a person takes regularly are thought to be causing the headaches
Following a safe weight-loss programme is recommended, for obese people affected by migraine headaches
","In some cases, medication may be prescribed to prevent migraine headaches. The medications that have been found most effective at migraine prevention include:[4][24]","
Anticonvulsant medications, such as those used to treat epilepsy
Non-selective beta-receptor blocking agents, such as those used to treat high blood pressure
Tricyclic antidepressants
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox®) injections are approved by the FDA as a treatment for chronic migraine
","These medications can be suitable for both adults and children. When used to prevent migraine headaches, they are usually taken on a long-term, ongoing basis. As a result, some of these medications may be unsuitable for some people, in relation to their overall general health and any other medications they may be taking. Doctors will advise on the appropriate dose, and course of treatment, for each person.",Symptom relief during migraine attacks,"A variety of treatments and medications, which are suitable for adults and children, are available to reduce the acute symptoms during a migraine attack. These include:",Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),"These include medications such as ibuprofen and aspirin. They can be purchased over the counter or prescribed, depending on the type and strength. NSAIDs are helpful in reducing headache pain; their anti-inflammatory properties can relieve the migraine’s characteristic throbbing/pulsing sensation.","However NSAIDs are not suitable for daily use, as they can cause complications, including gastrointestinal disorders. People who experience frequent migraine attacks and need regular pain relief should consult their doctor to ensure that their use of NSAIDs is appropriate. An alternative painkiller that is safe for ongoing use may be prescribed.",Triptan medications,"These medications work by making  blood vessels constrict and blocking pain pathways in the brain, which is thought to be a causal factor of migraines. They are often prescribed if OTC or prescription NSAIDs have proved ineffective for treating headache pain and work by imitating the action of a brain chemical called 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), also known as serotonin, which reduces inflammation and constricts the widened blood vessels associated with a migraine attack.[25]","Good to know: NSAIDs can be taken before a migraine attack begins, as soon as a person is aware that they may be developing a migraine. In contrast, triptan medications should be taken at the first sign of actual headache pain and not beforehand, as they can be less effective if used before the headache has fully developed.",Ergotamine medications,"Ergotamine is derived from a fungus called ergot. Normally, this medication is available with a combination of ergot and caffeine, and it has a long history of use in providing quick relief from migraine symptoms during headache attacks. However, it is recommended that affected people use ergotamine preparations no more than twice per month, as it has been linked to the development of chronic, persistent headaches in between migraine attacks.","Good to know: Ergotamine medications should not be combined with triptans, as they are believed to have harmful cross-reactivity with one another.",Opioid medications,"Opioid medications are sometimes prescribed for people who cannot take, or do not gain relief by taking, triptans, ergot medications or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).","Good to know: These medications are best used for occasional pain relief as they contain narcotics. Regular use, for example, treating chronic migraine headaches, can lead to dependency and also increases a person’s risk of developing medication overuse headaches.",Glucocorticoid medications,"Usually administered by a doctor as an injection, this type of corticosteroid medication may be prescribed in conjunction with other forms of medication to provide additional pain relief and reduce the frequency of headache attacks.","Good to know: These medications are only recommended for short-term use. As with other steroid medications, long term use of glucocorticoids can lead to the development of severe side effects, including increased risk of developing conditions such as gastritis, osteoporosis and diabetes.",Treatment for medically refractory migraine headaches,"In cases where no other preventive or acute treatments have provided significant relief from migraine headaches, an affected person may be recommended to explore neuromodulation therapies. As described by the International Neuromodulation Society, these are a recent development in the treatment of migraine headaches, which involve the use of technological devices which alter, or modulate, a person’s nerve activity by delivering targeted electrical or pharmaceutical agents to a specific area.","In treating migraine headaches, the device is used to supply the electrical or pharmaceutical agents to a specific area of the head or neck, for a particular amount of time. These factors will vary according to which particular treatment is used.","For more information about neuromodulation therapies in the treatment of medically refractory migraine headaches and other headache disorders, see this fact-sheet from the International Neuromodulation Society.",Treatment-related complications,"It is possible for a person to develop complications relating to the treatments used for their migraine headaches. If a person is newly diagnosed with migraine headaches, they should be aware of the possibility of developing treatment-related complications in future. These may manifest as headaches themselves, or other symptoms, and may include:","
Medication overuse headaches. These are headaches occurring regularly as a result of overusing medications designed to alleviate headache symptoms.
Abdominal pain. Certain pain relief products, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) like ibuprofen, can cause gastrointestinal side-effects if overused or used on a long-term basis.
Serotonin syndrome. This is a life-threatening complication which occurs when there is too much serotonin in the body, a potential consequence of using more than one medication which alters levels of serotonin.
","Good to know; People who are  taking migraine medications called triptans and antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are at increased risk of serotonin syndrome. Symptoms may include changes in behavior, mood and motor function.","People who are affected by migraine headaches are advised to inform their doctors of any changes to their symptoms, or new symptoms. These may indicate that the development of possible treatment-related complications, which can then be diagnosed and treated.",Where to seek treatment,"People who have been diagnosed with migraine headaches may wish to be referred to a migraine specialist; a doctor whose primary focus is treating migraine headaches. This is due to the fact that coming up with an effective treatment and management plan may be an ongoing or complex process, and research into the pathogenesis and treatment of migraines is a rapidly developing field.",Migraine specialists can be found:,"
At dedicated migraine clinics
Neurology departments of wider practices
For children: in some Neurology or Pediatrics departments
","However, a regular GP (general practitioner) will be usually able to help a person devise a treatment and management plan that works to minimise the impact of their migraine headaches.",Migraine headache FAQs,"Q: What are the best natural products/home remedies for treating migraine headaches?
A: During, or at the onset of a migraine attack, a person may find it helpful to spend time in a quiet, dark environment, lie down, drink plenty of water and gently massage the affected areas of the head and neck to relieve tension. Some people find it helpful to take a hot bath and/or use a hot compress in order to help soothe the pain and inflammation. For others, a cooler temperature, such as can be achieved by applying an ice-pack, may have the same effect.","Products based on certain herbs and spices, such as cayenne pepper, ginger and/or peppermint, have anti-inflammatory properties and may help to alleviate headache symptoms. Always use herbal products according to the instructions on the packet and consult a doctor before using them in conjunction with prescription medications, in order to prevent harmful cross-reactivity.","Q: Are migraine headaches different from cluster headaches?
A: Yes. Cluster headaches (CHs), another primary headache disorder, are often confused with migraine headaches due to the fact that people can also be affected by migraines in bouts, or clusters, and the headache attacks can have a similarly adverse impact on a person’s quality of life.","Key differences include the fact that CHs are always unilateral (affecting one side of the head); migraines involve a more generalized pain and typically affect both sides of the head at once. The duration of a migraine is usually much longer than that of a CH, which lasts between 15 minutes and three hours, without treatment. People affected by a migraine tend to want to sit or lie down, whereas a person experiencing a CH is prone to agitated movement, in response to the acuity of the pain.",Read more about Cluster Headaches »,"Q: What is an ophthalmoplegic migraine?
A: An ophthalmoplegic migraine is a term used to describe a painful paresis (muscular weakness) of one or more of the muscles that move the eye, accompanied by a headache. Young people are most commonly affected, and additional symptoms may include dilated pupils, difficulty moving the affected eye and a drooping eyelid. Despite its somewhat misleading name, the International Headache Society does not consider this condition to be a type of headache disorder, and instead classifies the condition as a recurrent cranial neuralgia.[26]","Q: Are migraine headaches linked to the development of any other conditions?
A: People who are affected by migraine headaches are considered to be at greater risk than the general population of developing certain conditions, including:[4]","
Psychological conditions, such as anxiety and depression
Ischemic stroke, particularly in those whose migraines are accompanied by an aura
High blood pressure
Hearing problems
","The links between having migraine headaches and developing these conditions are not fully understood.

A: No. Anecdotal evidence that migraine headaches can be relieved by piercing the daith, the ear's innermost cartilage fold and the crus of the helix, has recently received significant media coverage. The theory behind its reputed efficacy is that, similarly to acupuncture, having a piercing in this area functions to disrupt the nerve signalling that leads to migraine headaches, reportedly reducing their frequency and intensity. However, there is currently no scientific evidence to support the use of daith piercings in the treatment of migraine headaches.","Good to know: If you are considering getting a piercing in any part of the body, U.K.’s National Health Service (NHS) recommends always visiting a licensed body piercer, and practicing appropriate aftercare throughout the healing process, to reduce the risk of infection.[27]"

,,,,,,,,,,What is a miscarriage?
,,,,,,,,,,What is a miscarriage?,"A miscarriage is a fairly common complication of early pregnancy, in which the developing embryo or fetus dies in the womb, of natural causes or due to exposure to substances, i.e. in certain medications, which are unsuitable for use during pregnancy. The term miscarriage is used to describe this process when it happens during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy.",A miscarriage which occurs in the first trimester (weeks 1-12 of pregnancy) is known as an early miscarriage. A miscarriage which occurs in the second trimester (during weeks 13-20 of the pregnancy) is known as a late miscarriage. Loss of the fetus which occurs after week 20 of pregnancy is known as a stillbirth.[1],"The symptoms of a miscarriage include vaginal bleeding, cramping and abdominal pain, but it is also possible to experience a miscarriage without symptoms being present, and many miscarriages are diagnosed during a routine ultrasound scan.","Many people experience intense emotional distress after having a miscarriage, particularly if it occurs during a planned pregnancy. Nearly 20 percent of women, who experience a miscarriage, develop symptoms of depression and anxiety, for which a range of therapeutic treatment options are available. For most people, distress associated with a miscarriage begins to lessen around four months after the miscarriage.[2]",Symptoms of a miscarriage,"The potential symptoms of a miscarriage are broadly the same, whether it occurs in the first trimester (early miscarriage) or second trimester (late miscarriage). It is also possible to have a miscarriage without experiencing any symptoms, and some miscarriages are only detected during a routine scan.","When present, the most common symptoms of a miscarriage are:","
Abdominal pain
Vaginal bleeding
Discharge of fluid or tissue from the vagina
Cramping
No longer experiencing the symptoms of pregnancy, such as nausea and breast tenderness
",Read more about the Signs of Miscarriage »,"A person who is miscarrying may experience one or more of the possible symptoms, but their presence does not always indicate that a miscarriage is taking place: it is also possible to experience any of these symptoms as part of a healthy pregnancy, or due to a problem other than miscarriage.",Other explanations for the presence of symptoms of miscarriage include:,"
Implantation bleeding. This occurs in some pregnancies when the fertilized egg implants in the lining of the uterus.
A healthy pregnancy progressing normally. Pain, cramping, vaginal bleeding and discharge are normal features of early pregnancy. Vaginal bleeding in combination with abdominal pain or cramping is more likely to be indicative of a miscarriage than the presence of any of these symptoms on their own.
Ectopic pregnancy. Also known as a tube pregnancy, this occurs when the embryo attaches outside the uterus (womb). As with a miscarriage, abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding are two principal symptoms of ectopic pregnancy.
Molar pregnancy. This occurs when a lump of abnormal cells grows in the womb, instead of a healthy embryo. As with a miscarriage, vaginal bleeding is a principal symptom of molar pregnancy.

One can undergo an early pregnancy ultrasound scan to establish whether one is in fact experiencing a miscarriage, and to detect any other problems with the pregnancy. People experiencing symptoms that may be linked to a miscarriage can also carry out a symptom assessment using the free Ada app.",Types of miscarriage,The kind of miscarriage a person has depends on:[3],"
At what point within the timeline of a typical pregnancy the miscarriage occurs
Whether the miscarriage involves losing all or part of the pregnancy tissue, the protective sac, or lining, that forms around the developing fetus in the womb
How many times a person has been affected by miscarriage
",The principal types of miscarriage are:,"
Early miscarriage, i.e. in the first trimester
Late miscarriage, i.e. in the second trimester
Recurrent miscarriage, i.e. more than three consecutive miscarriages
","Chemical pregnancy, i.e. in very early pregnancy, even before ultrasounds can detect - a fetus",A miscarriage can also be classified according to how much pregnancy tissue and fetal matter are lost:[4],"
Complete miscarriage occurs when the fetus and all related pregnancy tissue are lost. No treatment is needed, but the previously pregnant person might benefit from psychotherapy to help process the experience.
Incomplete miscarriage occurs when only part of the fetal matter and pregnancy tissue exit the womb. Further medical treatment will be sometimes be needed to remove the remainder. Symptoms can be very subtle and can therefore go unnoticed.
Missed miscarriage occurs when the fetus dies within the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, but, in most cases, no fetal matter or tissue pass out of the womb. The physical miscarriage may have to be medically induced. Missed miscarriage is usually an incidental finding because there is rarely any indication that anything was wrong with the pregnancy.[5]
","To find out about the range of possible treatment options for incomplete and missed miscarriages, see Treatment.",Early miscarriage,A miscarriage which takes place in the first trimester (during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy) is known as an early miscarriage. This is the most common type of miscarriage and is most commonly caused by chromosomal abnormalities (problems with the foetus’s DNA) or by problems affecting the placenta.,Late miscarriage,A miscarriage which takes place in the second trimester (during weeks 13-20 of pregnancy) is known as a late miscarriage. Late miscarriages are much less common than early miscarriages and are often caused by:,"
Problems arising from uterine or cervical abnormalities
Invasive fetal diagnostic procedures
Rhesus isoimmunisation
Long-term (chronic) health conditions affecting the pregnant person, such as polycystic ovarian syndrome
The pregnant person contracting infections, which may be sexually transmitted; for example, chlamydia
Food poisoning; salmonella, toxoplasmosis and listeria
",Read more about Foods to Avoid During Pregnancy »,Recurrent miscarriage,"About 1 in 100 people experience recurrent miscarriages, which means having three or more miscarriages in a row.[6] People who experience recurrent miscarriages can undergo tests to see if there is an underlying cause. Because a person’s chances of miscarrying increase with age, someone over 35 years of age will usually be offered these tests after two early miscarriages.","The underlying cause(s) of miscarriage will be treated where possible. However, a cause is not always found as a result of testing. Not finding a cause for recurrent miscarriage is not necessarily a negative outcome: many people who experience recurrent miscarriages for no apparent cause go on to have a healthy pregnancy when they next conceive, without needing further treatment.[7]",Chemical pregnancy,"Many miscarriages occur very early in pregnancy, before a person is necessarily aware that they had become pregnant. This is called a chemical pregnancy, and occurs around week five of pregnancy – usually before pregnancy symptoms are present and always before the developing embryo would be visible on an ultrasound scan.","Some people, in particular, those who are trying to conceive, are aware of their chemical pregnancy, as it can be detected at this early stage on a pregnancy test. In a chemical pregnancy, the fertilized egg fails to survive in the uterus. After the miscarriage, future pregnancy tests related to this pregnancy will be negative.","It is possible for a person with a chemical pregnancy to be unaware of the pregnancy and of miscarrying, particularly if they were not trying to conceive, as symptoms like abdominal pain and/or blood loss may appear to be part of their next menstrual period.","Good to know: Many forms of birth control (contraception), such as the combined pill or progesterone-only (mini) pill work to thin the lining of the womb. These medications are usually taken intentionally to prevent pregnancy. One way in which they do this is by preventing the fertilized egg from implanting in the lining of the uterus. When a fertilized egg does not implant due to the effective use of birth control, this is not considered a chemical pregnancy.",Causes of miscarriage,"Most miscarriages occur in the first trimester and are a result of chromosomal abnormalities in the fetus or problems with the placenta. Miscarriages which occur in the second trimester are more likely to be caused by pregnancy complications related to long-term health conditions, diseases or infections.[8] If you are feeling unwell due to an unknown cause, you can get a free symptom assessment by downloading the Ada app.","Age is a principal factor in the likelihood of a miscarriage, and increases the likelihood of miscarrying in both the first and the second trimester. In people under 30, only 1 in 10 pregnancies will end in miscarriage. In people over 45, more than half of all pregnancies will end in miscarriage.[9]","A 2015 survey of people across the U.S. who have experienced a miscarriage found that over 75 percent of people strongly wish to know the cause of their miscarriage.[10] To help identify any possible causes for miscarriage, it is usual for doctors to perform:","
An autopsy on the pregnancy tissue
A placental exam
",Common causes of first-trimester (early) miscarriages include:[11],"
Chromosomal abnormalities: If an embryo has more or fewer than 23 pairs of chromosomes, this is a chromosomal abnormality, and it will be vulnerable to miscarriage, either during its embryo stage or when it develops into a fetus.[12] Chromosomal abnormalities are the most common cause of early miscarriage. They are detected in 50-85 percent of the pregnancy tissue specimens that are analyzed to determine the cause of miscarriage.[13]
Placental problems: The placenta is an organ which develops in the uterus during pregnancy to pass oxygen and nutrients to the foetus. It is pancake-shaped and should be positioned at the top of the uterus, as far away as possible from the cervix.[14] If the placenta does not form or function correctly, this is likely to negatively affect the development of the fetus, causing a miscarriage.
",Common causes of second-trimester (late) miscarriages include:,Long-term health conditions,"Certain long-term health conditions including diabetes, severe hypertension, coagulation disorder, lupus, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and kidney disease can make a person more prone to miscarrying. If a long-term health condition is being poorly managed or managed in a way which is unsuitable for pregnant people, the risk of miscarriage increases further.",Medications,"Some medications, including ibuprofen, certain vitamins and herbal supplements, are unsuitable for pregnant people, and using them can cause miscarriage or congenital abnormalities. Always consult a doctor before using any prescription or over-the-counter medication to ensure that it is suitable for use in pregnancy.",Diseases and infections,"Diseases and infections commonly linked to miscarriage and pregnancy complications include chlamydia, Dengue fever, rubella, cytomegalovirus, malaria, brucellosis, influenza, vaginal infection with bacterial vaginosis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Seek medical attention at the first sign of infection when pregnant and avoid activities and environments associated with increased risk.[15]",Food poisoning,"The most common types of food poisoning associated with miscarriage are salmonella, toxoplasmosis and listeriosis. Avoid uncooked and unpasteurised meats and animal products, in particular when pregnant in order to minimise the risk of food poisoning, and visit a doctor if symptoms such as fever, diarrhea or vomiting occur. Antibiotics given to pregnant people for food poisoning may reduce the likelihood of miscarrying if taken promptly.",Environmental factors,"Smoking tobacco and working in workplaces such as radiology departments, factories or farms are associated with an increased risk of miscarriage. It is strongly recommended that all people, who are trying to conceive or are pregnant, adapt their lifestyle and day-to-day routine in order to avoid factors such as pollution, pesticides and radiation to minimize the risk of miscarriage.",Womb or cervical dysfunction,"Problems with the womb or cervix structure or function can increase the likelihood of miscarrying. Many womb or cervical dysfunctions make a miscarriage particularly likely to occur in the second trimester, as the developing fetus grows in size.",Other possible causes for miscarriage include:,"
Invasive fetal diagnostic procedures
Rhesus isoimmunisation

Drinking alcohol
Consuming more than 200mg of caffeine per day (one or two cups)
Drug misuse
Being obese
Having certain long-term health conditions such as diabetes or hyperthyroidism
Having certain bacterial and viral infections, such as chlamydia or salmonella
","Although many resources falsely indicate that a restricted alcohol intake may be acceptable during pregnancy, according to the widely-accepted Dietary Guidelines 2015-2020, people who are or who may be pregnant should not drink any alcohol. As well as increasing the chances of miscarrying, alcohol consumption may result in negative behavioral or psychological consequences for the child.",Diagnosis,"Miscarriages are most commonly diagnosed using a combination of tests, including:","
Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test
Pelvic exam
Ultrasound
Fetal heart scanning
","It is important for the doctor(s) involved in diagnosing a miscarriage to be certain that the fetus has stopped living, which may involve some or all of these tests and/or waiting up to a week between the first and final scans, in order to complete the diagnosis.","This waiting time before a diagnosis is possible can be distressing. However, diagnostic testing is managed in this way to:","
Reduce any possibility of a misdiagnosis
Ensure that any treatments would not be carried out at risk of damaging an ongoing pregnancy
","In the second trimester (in a late miscarriage), there may be no need for tests to confirm the diagnosis. The miscarriage may be conclusively evidenced by symptoms including:","
Abdominal pain
Bleeding
Passing a recognisable pregnancy sac or tissue
Delivering the fetus
","In this instance, tests such as an autopsy on the pregnancy tissue or a placental exam may be performed to help determine the possible cause(s) of the miscarriage.",hCG test,Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a hormone produced by the placenta during pregnancy. This test can be:,"
Qualitative. A qualitative test is carried out to find out whether or not there is hCG in the blood, thereby proving the presence or absence of pregnancy. This is a urine test and is often how a person finds out they are pregnant initially.
Quantitative. A quantitative test is carried out to find out the precise amount of hCG in the blood. This is a blood test which is performed by a doctor to discover more information about a particular pregnancy. It might be repeated over a period of days or weeks in order to ascertain whether a person’s hCG levels are rising, decreasing or stabilizing.
","In a healthy pregnancy, hCG levels will continue to double approximately within the blood throughout the first trimester, reaching their peak at around week 11 of the pregnancy and decreasing slightly during the second trimester. If hCG levels begin to decrease in the first trimester, this is likely to indicate a miscarriage.","Wherever possible, this test will be performed in conjunction with ultrasound, fetal heart scanning and a pelvic exam before a miscarriage is diagnosed. However, in cases where ultrasound equipment is unavailable, the hCG blood test may sometimes be the primary means of confirming a suspected diagnosis of miscarriage.[16]",Pelvic exam,"A pelvic exam to diagnose miscarriage will be performed by an obstetrician, i.e. a doctor specializing in childbirth, and/or a gynecologist, a doctor specialising in the female reproductive system.","During a pelvic exam, a person will wear a loose hospital gown and lie on their back, with their feet in stirrups, so that the vagina and cervix can be easily examined. When diagnosing miscarriage, a doctor will check for the presence of two principal signs indicating miscarriage:","
The presence of tissue/blood in the cervical/vaginal opening
The dilation (opening) of the cervix
",Ultrasound,Ultrasound is an imaging technique which uses soundwaves to create an image of the developing fetus in the body. It is a painless and non-invasive procedure which can be performed by using the scanner in two different ways:[17],"
Transvaginally, usually before week 11 of pregnancy. In this case, a scanning probe is inserted into the vagina.
Transabdominally, usually from 11-12 weeks of pregnancy. Gel is spread on the skin of the lower abdomen, and the scanner is passed over the area.
","In diagnosing a miscarriage, doctors will look for various indicators in the ultrasound images. These can suggest how far advanced the miscarriage is and what kind of miscarriage is taking place. Indicators of miscarriage may include:","An empty pregnancy sac in the uterus
Pregnancy tissue but no fetus in the uterus
The fetus or embryo is smaller than it should be by this stage of pregnancy
No fetal heartbeat, if the pregnancy is far enough advanced to detect it, usually after week seven of pregnancy",Fetal heart scanning,The absence of the fetal heart rate (the baby’s heartbeat) is a principal factor in diagnosing miscarriage.,"The fetal heart scan is a specialized kind of ultrasound scan. The fetal heart can be scanned by means of ultrasound from around seven weeks into the pregnancy. At 13-14 weeks, the four chambers and great arteries can be clearly imaged, and many congenital heart abnormalities can be detected.[18]","As with a regular ultrasound scan, a fetal heart scan is a painless and non-invasive procedure, which can be performed transvaginally or transabdominally.[19]",Treatment for miscarriage @treatment:Treatment,"If a miscarriage is causing abdominal pain, suitable painkillers will be prescribed or recommended, and one’s doctor will advise on an appropriate dose. It is important not to take any medications, even painkillers, which have not been approved by a doctor.",Treatment depends on the type of miscarriage:[4],"
Some miscarriages do not require any physical treatment, because no pregnancy tissue is left in the womb. This is called a complete miscarriage.
In an incomplete miscarriage, some pregnancy tissue comes out of the uterus, but some remains inside. Treatment may be needed to remove the remaining tissue.
In a missed miscarriage, there are usually no cramps or bleeding, and the dead fetus remains inside the uterus. Sometimes, pregnancy tissue leaves the uterus, but a form of treatment may be needed to remove the fetus.
","In a complete miscarriage, without significant blood loss, no further medical or surgical treatment is needed. A person will be given simple aftercare instructions, including A person will be advised not to have sexual intercourse or any kind of vaginal penetration until the bleeding associated with the miscarriage has stopped (usually within two weeks after the process begins). Normal menstrual periods usually return 4-6 weeks after a miscarriage.","In an incomplete or missed miscarriage, a surgical or medical procedure may be prescribed in some instances in order to clear the uterus of all fetal and pregnancy tissue. Where possible, the course of treatment is left to the discretion of the person who is having the miscarriage. The American Family Physician finds that better mental health outcomes after miscarriage can be expected when a person’s treatment preferences are respected.","An incomplete or missed miscarriage can be managed expectantly, medically or surgically.",Expectant management,"Also known as conservative or wait-and-see management, expectant management involves waiting for the tissue to pass out of the womb naturally, which can take up to three weeks. This is the course of action often chosen by people who do not wish to have a medical or surgical procedure.",Expectant management is suitable for a person having a missed or incomplete miscarriage who:,"
Prefers passing the pregnancy tissue related to the miscarriage in the privacy of their home
Considers the ongoing or intermittent pain levels acceptable - over-the-counter and/or prescription painkillers will be recommended
Has no additional health complications that render this option inadvisable
","Experts on pregnancy loss advise that this course of action is ideal, where suitable, for people having a missed miscarriage who might wish to see, hold and perhaps memorialize their fetus with a burial or cremation, as it can be damaged by some of the more pragmatic miscarriage management procedures, such as dilation and extraction (D&E).","People who choose expectant management will need to return to hospital for a check-up on completion of the miscarriage, as there is an increased risk of infection. Medical or surgical intervention may be required if it does not complete as planned.[20]",Medical management,"Medical management of miscarriage involves taking medication to cause the uterus to contract, so that the pregnancy tissue passes out of the womb. In most cases, the medication can be taken in the privacy of a person’s home. The medication used is called misoprostol. It can be taken in two forms:[21]","
Orally as a tablet
Vaginally as a pessary, i.e. a tablet which can be inserted into the vagina with a special applicator
","Misoprostol works by causing cramping and bleeding to empty the uterus. Bleeding usually starts around one hour after taking the medication, and it takes 4-5 hours in total for the full amount of pregnancy tissue to pass. Nausea and diarrhea are common during this period, but are not a cause for concern.","Cramping may last for 1-2 days, and associated bleeding and spotting may continue for 4-5 weeks. A doctor will advise on the appropriate timing of the dose(s) and recommend suitable painkillers.[22]","If the miscarriage does not occur in the expected timeframe or there are any problems, it is important to consult a doctor. Surgery may be necessary to complete the process of miscarriage.","The recovery time after a medically-induced miscarriage is usually around four weeks, with a medical check-up usually scheduled for 1-2 weeks after taking the medication. Avoiding sexual activity until one’s next menstrual period is recommended to reduce the risk of infection.",Surgical management,Procedures which may be recommended following a miscarriage include:,"
Manual vacuum aspiration
Dilation and curettage (D&C)
Dilation and extraction (D&E)
",Manual vacuum aspiration,"This procedure is usually recommended for first-trimester miscarriages or as a means of removing leftover pregnancy tissue when the fetus has already passed out of the womb. A device is inserted into the cervix to empty the womb of all pregnancy tissue and fetal matter, using gentle suction. This procedure can be carried out under local anesthetic and takes around 10-15 minutes.",Medications to help the cervix dilate are usually given before the procedure. Light cramping and period-like pain can be expected afterwards. This usually settles within seven days.[23],Manual vacuum aspiration is used much more frequently as a treatment option than dilation and curettage or dilation and extraction (below).,Dilation and curettage (D&C),"This procedure is usually recommended for people having first-trimester miscarriages. D&C is usually performed under general anesthetic, but can also be carried out using local anesthetic via an intravenous therapy (IV) drip. The vagina is dilated using a device called a speculum, and the contents of the uterus are removed using an instrument called a curette, which scrapes the pregnancy tissue and fetal matter out of the uterine wall. Medications to help the cervix dilate are usually given before the procedure.","A person can undergo D&C as an outpatient procedure in most cases and return to normal activity around 24 hours afterwards. Light cramping and bleeding may last for up to two weeks, and appropriate painkillers, usually ibuprofen, will be recommended.[24]",Dilation and extraction (D&E),"This procedure is usually recommended for people having second-trimester miscarriages. D&E is almost always performed under general anesthetic, but can be carried out using local anesthetic via an IV drip.","During the procedure, the vagina is dilated using a speculum, and forceps (a grasping instrument) is used to remove the foetus. Often, the fetus may need to be divided into parts before it can be removed. Medications to help the cervix dilate are usually given before the procedure.","After the fetus is removed, a curette is used to scrape any remaining pregnancy tissue from the uterine wall. A person can undergo D&E as an outpatient procedure in most cases and return to normal activity around 24 hours afterwards. Light cramping and bleeding may last for up to two weeks, and appropriate painkillers, usually ibuprofen, will be recommended.[25]",Post-miscarriage psychological intervention,"Post-miscarriage intervention is psychological treatment following a miscarriage which focuses on helping one to overcome the feelings of grief, self-blame and worry that are commonly associated with miscarrying. It is very common to feel distressed following a miscarriage, and for some people these emotions can develop into depression and anxiety if left untreated.","The Miscarriage Association suggests that feelings associated with miscarrying might affect a person in a variety of different ways, including:","Guilt. Even though it is very unlikely that any given miscarriage could have been prevented, it is normal for a person to feel guilt after miscarrying, particularly if they were subject to any risk factors, such as a long-term health condition or a history of smoking, which may render miscarriage more likely.","Anger and jealousy. It is normal to feel anger in a variety of ways, including anger towards one’s own situation, oneself and hospital staff, and jealousy towards others who have never experienced a miscarriage or on hearing others’ pregnancy announcements.","Sadness. It is normal to feel sad and tearful, either in relation to specific thoughts or with no obvious trigger.",Shock and confusion. These emotions are especially common if the pregnancy was progressing healthily prior to the miscarriage.,"Physical emptiness. It is common for a person to feel acutely aware that they are no longer carrying a developing fetus, particularly if they had been acutely monitoring their sensations during pregnancy.",Panic. A miscarriage can be an intensely stressful experience and a sensation of loss of control is common in the weeks following it.,"Numbness. Although a miscarriage can be distressing for many people, it is also possible for a person to feel an absence of intense feelings and to find this distressing in itself.","Loneliness, Many people, who have experienced a miscarriage, report the sensation that others do not understand how they are feeling. There are many organizations which can connect a person with others who have shared the experience of miscarriage. This can be an effective way to alleviate the feelings of loneliness that often accompany this impactful life event.","There are many different formats of post-miscarriage intervention available for people affected by a miscarriage, which can help a person to process the experience and avoid developing long-term depression and anxiety. These include:","
One-on-one counseling
Group counseling, for both partners and/or other family members
Miscarriage support groups with other people who have experienced miscarriage
","Healthcare providers will be able to direct people and families, who have experienced a miscarriage, towards available services and can provide advice on choosing the most appropriate kind of support for the affected person, couple or family.",Prevention,"In most cases, it is not possible to prevent a miscarriage. However, it is possible to reduce the risk of miscarrying and to increase the potential of treating any complications of pregnancy that arise before they result in a miscarriage. This requires good antenatal care – a care plan devised with one’s doctor to increase the chances of a healthy pregnancy.",Antenatal care generally involves:,"
Having regular medical check-ups to ascertain the health of the pregnant person and developing fetus
Avoiding alcohol, tobacco, excess caffeine and other substances associated with an increased risk of miscarrying
Avoiding environments and situations which are associated with an increased risk of miscarrying
Eating a recommended pregnancy diet
Ensuring that any pre-existing medical conditions which may affect pregnancy are adequately managed prior to conception to reduce their potential impact on the pregnancy
","If you are considering becoming pregnanct and suspect you may have an undiagnosed medical condition due to the presence of unexplained symptoms, you can get a free symptom assessment by downloading the Ada app.",Miscarriage FAQs,"Q: What are the most common misconceptions about the causes of miscarriage?
A: There are several widespread myths about certain factors being causes of miscarriage. Many pregnant people avoid air travel, eating spicy food and having sexual relations during pregnancy, but these activities are not medically linked to miscarrying. It is also common to avoid exercise during pregnancy with the aim of preventing a miscarriage. However, as long as an exercise programme has been approved by a doctor, it is safe for a pregnant person to carry out without risk to the developing fetus.[10]",Read more about the Causes of Miscarriage »,"Q: If a pregnant person experiences cramping, vaginal bleeding or discharge, does this mean they are having a miscarriage?
A: Not necessarily. Vaginal bleeding is common in early pregnancy. Bleeding may occur due to the implantation of the fertilized egg in the uterus (implantation bleeding), and discharge can be caused by more blood than normal flowing to the pelvic area during pregnancy. However, bleeding and cramping may indicate a miscarriage, and a pregnant person should always consult their doctor if they experience vaginal bleeding in order to confirm the status of the developing fetus.",Read more about the Signs of Miscarriage »,"Q: How soon after a miscarriage can a person have sex and/or try to become pregnant again?
A: For most people, the vaginal bleeding associated with a miscarriage lasts for under two weeks. During the period of vaginal bleeding, the uterus and cervix may remain dilated. This renders the vaginal area at increased risk of contracting bacterial infections. The risk of infection can be reduced by avoiding sexual activity involving the vagina until the bleeding has stopped.","Waiting until after the next period before trying to conceive is recommended after a miscarriage. It is possible to become pregnant as soon as a new egg is released and fertilized by a sperm, which may happen as soon as a new reproductive cycle begins in the female body. Although it is therefore possible to become pregnant very soon after a miscarriage, waiting until the next period is recommended for two principal reasons: it increases one’s chances of accurately dating the new pregnancy, and it allows for the womb and cervix to return to their normal function following the miscarriage, helping to ensure hospitable conditions for the new developing fetus.","Q: Is a person who has had a miscarriage more likely than others to miscarry in future?
A: Having a miscarriage is not an indication that a person will miscarry in the future. Many people experience one or more miscarriages before going on to have a healthy pregnancy. If a person experiences more than one miscarriage, they may wish to undergo tests to identify any underlying conditions which may be causing them to miscarry. However, it is possible to experience recurrent miscarriages without discerning an underlying cause and to then go on to have a healthy pregnancy.",Other names for miscarriage,"

,,,,,,,,,,What is a molar pregnancy?
,,,,,,,,,,What is a molar pregnancy?,"A molar pregnancy, sometimes called a hydatidiform mole or gestational trophoblastic disease, is a rare complication of pregnancy, which results from a problem related to the genetic makeup of the fused egg and sperm and which occurs during conception. This causes a fluid-filled mass of tissue to grow inside the womb, instead of a healthy pregnancy. A molar pregnancy will not develop into a baby.","A molar pregnancy will often have the same symptoms as a normal pregnancy in its early stages, and may go undetected until the first routine ultrasound scan, if it is not miscarried before this time.  Most molar pregnancies are diagnosed in the first trimester, before any classic signs and symptoms are present. However, symptoms which could indicate a molar pregnancy include vaginal bleeding, severe nausea and vomiting, tummy growth which can be faster or slower than normal, and signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism.[1][2]","A molar pregnancy can be removed, and most people will make a full recovery. Very rarely, molar pregnancy may become cancerous. However, these cancers have a very good prognosis with a high cure rate of nearly 100 percent.[3]",Molar pregnancy affects about one in every 1000 or 2000 pregnant people.[4] The reported incidence varies widely in different regions of the world.,"Many people experience emotional distress after having a molar pregnancy, particularly if it occurs during a planned pregnancy or if chemotherapy is necessary. A range of therapeutic treatment options are available.",Molar pregnancy symptoms,"Molar pregnancy often has no symptoms differing from a normal pregnancy and is frequently diagnosed during a routine ultrasound. However, the most common signs and symptoms that could indicate molar pregnancy are:[5][6]","
Vaginal bleeding early in the pregnancy, which may contain little fluid-filled cysts
High level of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) (pregnancy hormone)
Bigger abdomen (tummy) than expected for the number of weeks pregnant
Pelvic pressure or pain
",Less common signs and symptoms include:[5],"
Hyperemesis gravidarum (severe nausea and vomiting)
Early onset preeclampsia (high blood pressure in pregnancy)
Signs of hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid), such as nervousness, insomnia and heart palpitations
",Molar pregnancy causes,"A molar pregnancy occurs when there is a problem with the genetic information of a fused ovum (egg) and sperm. While a molar pregnancy cannot be predicted, because little is known about how and why it occurs, factors that are thought to increase the risk of having one include:[6][7]","
Being younger than 15 or older than 35
A history of molar pregnancy
A history of miscarriage
A diet low in carotene (a form of vitamin A)
",Types of molar pregnancy,"A molar pregnancy may be complete or incomplete, depending on the number of chromosomes of the fertilized egg.","In normal conception, a single sperm with 23 chromosomes fertilizes an egg with 23 chromosomes, making 46 in all.",Complete molar pregnancy,"In this situation, one sperm, or sometimes two, fertilize an egg that has no genetic material.  No embryo will grow, because there are no maternal chromosomes.","Normally a fertilized empty egg dies, but in rare cases it implants in the uterine wall. This causes trophoblast cells, the cells that would become a placenta, to grow rapidly into clusters of cysts or a complete mole.[8][9]",Partial molar pregnancy,"A partial mole occurs when two sperm fertilize the egg instead of one. This means that there are 69 instead of 46 chromosomes, creating too much genetic material.","There may initially be a fetus, but it will be genetically abnormal and cannot survive, while the trophoblastic cells will grow rapidly, filling the womb with cysts.[8][9]",Molar pregnancy complications,"In some cases, after removal of a molar pregnancy, a number of cells may remain behind and develop into gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN), which is cancerous and can be very serious if left untreated. However, GTN has a very good prognosis, with a near 100 percent cure rate. There are two types of GTN that can result from a molar pregnancy:","Persistent trophoblastic disease (PTD): Also known as an invasive mole or chorioadenoma destruens, PTD is where part of the mole remains in the body and can grow quickly into a locally invasive tumor. This is more likely to occur after a complete molar pregnancy.","Choriocarcinoma: A very rare cancer which grows from the placenta and can metastasize (spread) throughout the body if left untreated. It can also occur after a healthy pregnancy or a miscarriage, but those with a molar pregnancy are at a higher risk.[10]",Molar pregnancy diagnosis,"Molar pregnancies are commonly discovered during the first routine ultrasound scan of a pregnancy. If a person develops bleeding in early pregnancy, the doctor will normally arrange a scan, in which case the condition may be found sooner.","The image from the ultrasound scan may be characteristic of a molar pregnancy, showing cysts that resemble a cluster of grapes, in which case the condition will be treated.","Often, however, the image may resemble that of a miscarriage. The further along the molar pregnancy is, the more characteristic the ultrasound picture becomes. If the doctor suspects a molar pregnancy, a blood test will be ordered to check if the hCG levels are higher than normal, far higher in comparison to possible hCG levels that may occur in normal pregnancies. See these resources for more information on miscarriage and signs of miscarriage.","If there is both an ultrasound image that looks like a miscarriage and higher-than-normal hCG levels, the person will be treated to remove the abnormal tissue in the uterus.",Tissue miscarried or removed from the uterus will be sent to a laboratory and tested to see if molar tissue is  present. Diagnosis can then be confirmed.,"Malignant trophoblastic tumors primarily metastasize to the lungs, so once diagnosis of a molar pregnancy is confirmed, this should be ruled out by taking a baseline chest radiograph.[11]",There may be a delay of a few days or weeks between treatment and the receipt of confirmation that the person had a molar pregnancy.[9],Molar pregnancy treatment,"Treatment for a molar pregnancy usually takes the form of dilation and curettage (D&C), sometimes known as surgical uterine evacuation, dilation and evacuation, surgical management of miscarriage (SMM), evacuation of retained products of conception (ERPC) or a scrape. This is a minor operation done under general anesthetic, in which the cervix, the passage leading from the uterus to the vagina, is dilated so that abnormal tissue in the uterus can be removed with suction and a spoon-like instrument (curette). There is likely to be vaginal bleeding for up to six weeks after surgery, which may be heavy at first.","People who have completed childbearing may have the option of hysterectomy, a surgical procedure to remove the womb.",Molar pregnancy follow-up,"There is a small risk of developing gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) after a molar pregnancy has been treated. GTN is a serious condition that requires rapid treatment, so all people who have had molar pregnancies should be monitored afterwards.","During a molar pregnancy, hCG (pregnancy hormone) levels rise, but should return to normal once the person has been treated. For at least six months after the end of treatment for a molar pregnancy, hCG levels will typically be monitored through urine tests. If they do not return to normal, this could indicate GTN.","It is important to take steps to avoid becoming pregnant for about six months after treatment, as this would interfere with the monitoring of hCG levels for signs of GTN.","After a complete mole, the likelihood of developing GTN is significantly increased. After a partial mole, this risk only increases slightly. The reported incidence of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) after each type of molar pregnancy is:","
Complete mole: 15-20 percent
Partial mole: 1-5 percent
",Molar pregnancy and emotions,"It is normal to feel distressed after a molar pregnancy, and in some people these emotions can develop into depression and anxiety if left untreated.","The Miscarriage Association suggests that a person with molar pregnancy might experience a variety of associated feelings, including:","
Shock and confusion. These emotions are especially common if the pregnancy was planned and thought to be healthy prior to an ultrasound scan or miscarriage. It can be shocking for a person to find out they have a condition which they probably never heard of before.
Fear and anxiety. A molar pregnancy may lead to fear of the possibility of having cancer, and fear that problems will happen again with any future pregnancies.
Loss and grief. It is normal to feel grief if a baby was expected.
Feeling stuck. It is common to feel stuck if wanting to try to conceive again and having to wait some time while having follow-up and repeated blood and urine tests.
",Counseling is available for people affected by a molar pregnancy. Support groups such as MyMolarPregnancy.com are also available and may be able to put a person in touch with others in a similar situation.,Health practitioners will be able to provide advice to those affected by a molar pregnancy on choosing the most appropriate kind of support and direct them towards available services.,Molar pregnancy FAQs,"Q: Can a molar pregnancy survive?
A: No, a molar pregnancy cannot develop into a baby, as it does not have a correct set of chromosomes. Molar pregnancies may at first seem to have the same symptoms as a normal pregnancy and generate a positive result on a pregnancy test. In the case of complete molar pregnancy, no fetus will develop. In a partial molar pregnancy, fetal tissue may initially develop, it will, however, be genetically abnormal and cannot survive, and will be overtaken by rapidly-growing cysts.","Q: Will a person who has had a molar pregnancy be able to have a normal pregnancy in future?
A: Yes, a person who has had a molar pregnancy will normally have no complications with future pregnancies. The risk of another molar pregnancy is increased, but is still only around 1-2 percent. The recurrence rate after two molar pregnancies has been reported to range from 11 to 25 percent. However, a person should take measures to avoid becoming pregnant for at least six months after the end of molar pregnancy treatment, to allow hCG monitoring for remaining molar tissue. If chemotherapy follow-up treatment has been used, a person should take measures to avoid becoming pregnant for at least one year after the end of treatment, to allow for hCG monitoring and also to allow the chemotherapy, which can be very damaging to an unborn baby, to clear the body.","Q: Blighted ovum vs molar pregnancy - what is the difference?
A: Blighted ovum, also known as anembryonic pregnancy, is a condition in which a fertilized egg attaches itself to the uterine wall, but an embryo does not develop, usually due to chromosomal abnormalities or abnormal cell division. Molar pregnancy is caused by chromosomal abnormalities due to abnormal conception, and causes a mass of fluid-filled cysts to grow, instead of a healthy pregnancy. Blighted ovum and partial molar pregnancy can look similar on an ultrasound. However, a partial mole usually shows the remains of embryonic tissue, which never appears in a blighted ovum.[12]",Other names for molar pregnancy,"

,,,,,,,,,,What is morning sickness?
,,,,,,,,,,What is morning sickness?,"Morning sickness is pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting, typically occurring between weeks 5 and 20. Despite the name, the symptoms of morning sickness can present themselves at any time of the day, and some women may feel sick throughout the day.","The condition affects roughly 50 to 90 percent of pregnant women. It is generally mild and usually poses no risk to the developing baby, unless it develops into a more severe and longer lasting condition called hyperemesis gravidarum, which may affect the baby’s birth weight.[1] However, morning sickness can cause discomfort and significantly interfere with the day-to-day lives of pregnant women. There are a range of treatment options available to help manage the condition.",Causes of morning sickness,"The specific cause of morning sickness is not clear, though it is likely to be due to the hormonal changes the body undergoes during pregnancy.","There are, nonetheless, certain things that can make morning sickness more likely. These include:[2][3]","
It being a first pregnancy
Having a female baby
Having twins or multiple babies
Having a history of motion sickness
Having a history of migraines
Having had nausea when taking the combined contraceptive pill
Family history of morning sickness
Stress
Obesity
Having gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
",Symptoms of morning sickness,"The key symptoms of morning sickness are nausea and vomiting. Symptoms typically come and go throughout the day and last for between one and four hours. Some women, however, may feel sick throughout the day.","The symptoms of morning sickness usually begin during weeks 5 to 6, peak during week 9 of pregnancy and disappear by week 16 to 20.

Fever and diarrhea
","If treated effectively, hyperemesis gravidarum is unlikely to cause any harm to the baby.",Treatment for morning sickness,"Treatment for morning sickness is aimed at providing as much relief from the symptoms of the condition as possible and avoiding any loss of weight or deficiency of any vitamins or minerals. There is no specific treatment method that works for all women. Instead, women are encouraged to try a variety of methods to see what works for them.","To help manage mild cases of morning sickness, simple lifestyle changes may be recommended. These include:[5]","
Getting plenty of rest
Avoiding smells, foods or anything else that may trigger nausea, which could include stuffy and/or noisy rooms, heat and humidity
Eating small and frequent meals, perhaps every one to two hours and high in carbohydrates and low in fat
Drinking plenty of fluids
Eating food or drink containing ginger, which, evidence suggests, is a natural antiemetic (vomiting suppressant)
","If lifestyle changes do not help to remedy the morning sickness, a doctor may prescribe pregnancy-friendly anti-sickness medication (antiemetics). Often, this will be a form of vitamin B6 called pyridoxine, which may be used in combination with a specific antihistamine – doxylamine – which is usually used to treat allergies, but which can also be effective at preventing sickness. The medication will generally be in tablet form, though an injection or suppository may be used if the individual is unable to keep down fluids.[5]","The medications used to treat morning sickness are safe for use in pregnancy and will have no effect on the development of the baby. However, before taking any type of medication, always seek the opinion of a doctor.","In a small number of cases, those that resemble hyperemesis gravidarum, morning sickness may need to be treated in a hospital. This will only be necessary if the individual does not respond to treatment and is consequently losing weight and becoming dehydrated. In the hospital, fluids will be administered intravenously (through a drip) to prevent dehydration.",Alternative morning sickness treatment methods,There are a number of alternative treatment methods for morning sickness.,"Acupuncture and acupressure  have become particularly popular. The first is a technique derived from ancient Chinese medicine involving the insertion of fine needles into certain points on the body; the latter is a technique similar to acupuncture, involving the application of pressure to certain points on the body, often using a specially designed wristband.","Both techniques can be self-administered and do not require a prescription, making them easily accessible to most women. Although neither technique is medically proven beyond doubt to be effective besides the possibility of a placebo effect, both are considered to be safe during pregnancy and may help on an individual basis.[6]","Hypnosis is also considered safe and may be helpful in the relief of symptoms for some patients. Psychotherapy, likewise, can also be useful and supportive for some women, especially those whose symptoms are exacerbated by anxiety and stress surrounding the pregnancy.[6]","Most other alternative treatment methods have not been studied comprehensively and should therefore be avoided. This includes marijuana, which is not considered safe for consumption during pregnancy by most medical professionals.[6]",Morning sickness prognosis,"The majority of women who experience morning sickness will recover completely and experience no further problems related to the condition.

Peppermint: Tea or other drinks containing peppermint may help ease morning sickness.
",Always talk to a doctor or midwife before beginning to use any morning sickness remedies.,"Q: Can I experience morning sickness at night?
A: Yes, a rarer kind of morning sickness may also occur at night, or indeed at any time of the day.[8] Morning sickness at night can be particularly troublesome, as it can prevent women from falling asleep or even wake them during the night. As feelings of nausea often occur on an empty stomach, one possible way to help prevent sickness at night is to eat a light snack in the evening, before bed.[9] While this method is worth trying, it will not be effective for all women. Women experiencing persistent morning sickness at night should speak to their doctor or midwife.","Q: What does it mean if I experience no morning sickness?
A: Research has suggested that there may be a link between morning sickness and a lower chance of miscarriage, based on the idea that it protects the fetus against bacteria and toxins contained in food and drink.[10] Nonetheless, women who do not experience morning sickness should not worry excessively. Every pregnancy is different, and the evidence for this protective factor theory is yet to be fully confirmed.[11]"
,,,,,,,,,,What is multiple myeloma?
,,,,,,,,,,What is multiple myeloma?,"Multiple myeloma is a cancer which affects the bone marrow. The bone marrow is where blood cells are made and mature. Myeloma is caused by a white blood cell called a plasma cell, which normally work to produce proteins which fight infections (antibodies). When a plasma cell cancer occurs, the plasma cells not only grow out of control in the bone marrow, but also impair the ability of the bone marrow to make other healthy blood cells. Multiple myeloma is so named because the cancer is often found in several different bones. Symptoms of multiple myeloma may be the result of decreased normal blood cells, such as paleness, shortness of breath, feeling more tired than usual and bleeding gums, or the result of quick growth of the cancer cells, such as unexpected weight loss, bone pain or fragile bones. There is currently no cure for multiple myeloma, but there are treatment options that help to control the disease. Myeloma is usually a slow-growing cancer, and for this reason, the outlook depends on factors such the age of the person diagnosed, the aggressiveness of the cancer and the development of complications.",Risks,"Multiple myeloma is a cancer which affects cells which are growing in the bone marrow. Bone marrow is the spongy tissue inside bones where all blood cells grow and mature. Plasma cells are a type of white blood cell that help the body fight infections by producing proteins called antibodies. Myeloma is a cancer that arises from abnormal plasma cells, causing them to multiply quickly. This overgrowth of plasma cells crowds the growth of healthy blood cells, which affects the body's ability to transport oxygen, clot when bleeding, and fight infections. These plasma cells also produce extra proteins, which can damage the kidneys. The cause of multiple myeloma is unknown. However, the risk of developing a multiple myeloma increases with age. It rarely affects people under 40 years and is mostly diagnosed by the age of 70. Men are more likely than women to develop this condition.",Symptoms,"Common symptoms include paleness, shortness of breath, feeling tired and bleeding gums. Other symptoms may include weight loss, bone pain and fragile bones. Some people may suffer blood clots, recurrent infections or kidney problems. There may be no symptoms in the early stages of this condition, because symptoms develop as the disease progresses.",Diagnosis,"The diagnosis may be suspected based on the symptoms and physical examination, but can only be confirmed with further testing. Blood tests can show if there is a problem with blood cell production, and urine tests may show extra protein as a result of the increased activity of the plasma cells. A PET scan (a special type of CT scan) may be done to look for other sites of multiple myeloma around the body. A small sample of the bone marrow (biopsy) is taken with a needle and is checked for cancer cells.",Treatment,"There is currently no cure for multiple myeloma, but there are treatment options that help to control the disease. Treatment may involve a combination of chemotherapy, radiotherapy and stem cell transplantation. The exact combination of therapies depends on the stage of the disease, the general health of the affected person and whether any complications have occurred. The treating doctor can give the best advice for treatment in individual cases. Complications such as bone pain, fracture, anemia and kidney damage may require specific treatment."
,,,,,,,,,,What is multiple sclerosis?
,,,,,,,,,,What is multiple sclerosis?,"Multiple sclerosis (commonly called MS) is a neurological disease, in which there is slow, progressive nerve damage. The cause of this nerve damage is unknown, but may be related to an overactive immune system. This condition is more common in women than men, and most people are diagnosed between the ages of 15 and 60. Because all of the nerves in the body can be affected, the symptoms of MS also vary from person to person. The most common symptoms are vision problems, strange sensations in the arms and legs and muscle weakness. MS is diagnosed by a specialist neurologist and by having magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The symptoms of MS can be relapsing (symptoms come and go, with symptom-free periods), or can progressively worsen without improvement. There are treatments which can help with the symptoms and slow down the progression of the nerve damage, but no treatments which can cure MS.",Risks,"Women are affected more often and, on average, at a younger age than men. Most people are diagnosed between the ages of 15 and 60, although this condition can affect people of any age. People with a family member with multiple sclerosis may be more likely to develop this condition. The cause of multiple sclerosis is unknown, but many specialists think that an overactive immune system, which attacks the body's own nerve cells, might be part of the cause.",Symptoms,"MS can affect any nerves in the body, so the symptoms can be very different from person to person. More common symptoms include a loss of vision, a loss of feeling in the arms or legs, weakness in the arms or legs, dizziness and imbalance. Some people develop bowel and bladder problems. Additionally, a lot of people with MS find that they feel tired all the time. People with MS may experience cycles of relapse (in which their symptoms come and go, with symptom-free periods), or can progressively worsen without improvement. Warm weather or warm baths may make symptoms worse.",Diagnosis,"This condition is diagnosed by a specialist neurologist based on the symptoms, the physical examination and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Other tests might include testing individual nerve function, blood tests and testing the cerebrospinal fluid, the fluid that surrounds the nerves and the brain.",Treatment,"Treatment mostly consists of weakening the immune system. There are many medications that can do this for people with MS. One of the most widely used medications is called interferon. These medications can help to reduce the severity of the episodes and prolong the period between attacks. However, there is currently no cure available for MS. Physical exercise and physiotherapy can be helpful to maintain strength and balance, and regain strength after an episode."

,,,,,,,,,,What is musculoskeletal lower back pain?
,,,,,,,,,,What is musculoskeletal lower back pain?,"Musculoskeletal lower back pain is a common condition affecting the muscles and bones of the lower back. About 40 percent of the population will have this condition at some point of their life. It can develop suddenly or progressively over many weeks or months. Accidents, fractures, surgery, heavy work, intensive sports and medical conditions (such as arthritis and osteoarthritis) are common causes of the lower back pain. Back pain, back stiffness and back muscle spasms are typical symptoms. Treatment depends upon the cause of the pain.",Risks,"The muscles of the back are almost constantly in use, and because of this, tend to get injured often. Common causes of back muscle injury are heavy lifting and moments of abnormal movements. In most cases, pain is not related to a severe condition, and is due to sprained ligaments or muscles. Persistent, ongoing pain may be due to a slipped disc or spinal joint problems. Around 40 percent of the population will have lower back pain at some point in their life. Obesity, stress, and jobs that involve frequent bending and heavy lifting are all factors which increase the risk of developing lower back pain.",Symptoms,"The most typical symptom is pain over the lower back and, sometimes, the buttocks. The pain can be sharp, dull, aching or with tingling or burning sensations. Pain can differ from person to person and also may involve radiating pain to the hip or even further down. Certain movements may make the pain better or worse. The muscles of the back may become stiff or hard.",Diagnosis,"The diagnosis is usually based on the symptoms and physical examination, which includes observing the movement of the back and legs. X-rays of the lower back are usually not needed unless the pain becomes long-standing or there are symptoms which could be caused by more serious conditions.",Treatment,"The treatment of lower back pain involves pain relief and gentle movements of the back. Simple pain-relief, such as paracetamol and ibuprofen are often helpful in reducing back pain. People with back pain should continue their daily activities and gentle exercise, such as walking, as soon as possible. Resting the back for a long period may make symptoms worse and make the person susceptible to recurrent back pain.",Prevention,"Correct lifting techniques, regular exercise, stretching before sport and maintaining a healthy weight can all help to prevent episodes of lower back pain.",Other names for musculoskeletal lower back pain,"

,,,,,,,,,,What is myasthenia gravis?
,,,,,,,,,,What is myasthenia gravis?,"Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune condition that causes muscles to become weak and quickly tired. In this condition the immune system mistakenly produces proteins that fight infections (antibodies) that attack the the body's healthy tissues. These interfere with the ability of nerves to pass information to muscles. Often the muscles of the eyes and eyelids are affected, causing the common symptoms of eyelid drooping and blurred vision. Muscle weakness typically becomes more noticeable over the course of the day or with exertion and improves on resting. Medication is available that improves the communication between nerves and muscles and thus increases the muscles strength, but there is no sure cure for this condition.",Risks,"Myasthenia gravis is a rare condition. It occurs when the immune system mistakenly produces proteins that fight infections (antibodies) against parts of the muscles responsible for transmitting impulses from the nerves to make muscles work. This causes the muscles to work slowly and become weak. The reason why this occurs is uncertain, though it is thought than an overactive thymus gland may be partially responsible. Women are slightly more likely than men to develop this condition, and it tends to become more common with age.",Symptoms,"The main symptom of myasthenia gravis is a muscle weakness which gets worse over the course of the day. The most commonly affected muscles are the eye, face and throat. People with myasthenia gravis may notice that their eyelids droop, that they develop blurred or double vision or difficulties with chewing, talking or swallowing. Sometimes the muscles of the limbs or the neck can be affected. This may cause problems with walking, posture and balance. People with myasthenia gravis may experience a period during which their symptoms become much worse than normal. These episodes can cause weakness of the breathing muscles and lead to severe breathing difficulty with an inability to cough.",Diagnosis,"The diagnosis may be suspected based on the symptoms and neurological examination, but a blood test for the antibodies is the only way to confirm the diagnosis. Other tests of nerve and muscle function may help to confirm the diagnosis.",Treatment,"Muscle weakness can be improved by taking medication that improves the communication between nerves and muscles. Medications to dampen the immune system, such as steroids and immuno-suppressant medications, are also commonly used. In cases of a severe deterioration of muscle strength, medications may need to be given through the veins to suppress the immune system. In some cases, removal of the thymus gland can improve the symptoms, but this does not cause immediate improvement."
,,,,,,,,,,What is a myocardial infarction?
,,,,,,,,,,What is a myocardial infarction?,"Myocardial infarction, commonly known as a heart attack, is a serious condition where a coronary artery (a blood vessel of the heart) is blocked and can not supply the heart muscle with blood and oxygen. This causes damage to the heart muscle. The typical symptoms are chest and arm pain, shortness of breath, nausea and a cold sweat. A heart attack requires immediate medical assistance.",Risks,"Heart attacks are slightly more common in men than women, and are most common in middle-aged and older adults. Important risk factors are diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, drinking alcohol, smoking, being overweight and having a family member who has had a heart attack. People who have had one heart attack are more likely to have another.",Symptoms,"The most common symptom is the feeling of pressure, tightness or pain in the chest, which may spread to the left arm or the jaw or the back. Not all people who are having a heart attack have chest pain. Other common symptoms are shortness of breath, cold sweats, dizziness, fainting and nausea.",Diagnosis,"Diagnosis is made by a physician based on the symptoms, the physical examination, a troponin test (troponin is a protein found in the blood after a heart attack) and an electrocardiogram (an ECG or EKG). The most conclusive test to check for blockages in the heart arteries is coronary angiography, where dye is injected into the heart blood vessels and X-rays are taken.",Treatment,"Treatment during a heart attack aims to widen the blocked blood vessel, remove the blockage in the heart artery and help the person having the heart attack with pain relief, extra oxygen etc. To widen the artery, the paramedics or doctors will give a tablet or spray immediately, called nitroglycerine. To remove the blockage, the person having the heart attack will have medications to thin the blood. Sometimes urgent cardiac catheterization (a tube through the leg blood vessels into the heart blood vessels) is done to find and remove the blockage. If the blockage or narrowing is severe, the doctor may put a stent (a small wire cage) into the blood vessel to widen the vessel. It is important to have urgent treatment in order to prevent heart muscle damage. After a heart attack, cardiac rehabilitation (physical therapy) is important to help the heart regain strength.",Prevention,"Preventing heart attacks involves life-style and diet changes. Being physically active, maintaining a healthy weight, quitting smoking and reducing alcohol intake can all help to prevent heart attacks.

","Occasionally, an endomyocardial biopsy may be performed. This entails removing a small tissue sample from the heart and testing it to determine the cause(s) of the myocarditis.[1][3][11]",Endomyocardial biopsy and cardiac MRI are the preferred diagnostic tests for distinguishing myocarditis from other conditions that affect the heart.[14],"If you think that you might have a health condition, try using the Ada app to find out more about your symptoms.",Treatment,"In many cases, myocarditis can be treated.  The treatment recommended depends on the cause and the severity of the symptoms. During treatment, tobacco and alcohol should be avoided.",Bed rest,"People who have been diagnosed with myocarditis should rest and avoid physical exertion, including exercise, for several months to avoid straining the heart muscle. Myocarditis recovery times vary, and a medical practitioner will be able to advise when exercise can be resumed safely.",Medication,"Painkillers and anti-inflammatory medication may be prescribed for the management of fever, chest pain and discomfort. If the symptoms of myocarditis are mild, no other treatment, besides bed rest, may be needed.[1][3][15]",Treating underlying causes,"Where possible, the underlying cause of the myocarditis should be addressed. Antibiotics may be prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, while steroids may be needed to treat giant cell myocarditis.[1] If an autoimmune condition such as systemic lupus erythematosus is implicated, this should be treated.[11]",Hospital treatment,"Where myocarditis symptoms are severe, hospitalization may be necessary. People presenting with heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias may require urgent treatment with the following:[15]","
Oxygen

",Some of these treatments may need to be continued to support the heart and blood pressure until the myocardium recovers.,Complications,"In many cases, the prognosis is good, and myocarditis clears up on its own, without any complications or long-term health effects. However, sometimes the heart sustains damage, leaving a degree of heart failure that requires lifelong management.[1] This may involve lifestyle changes and chronic medication.[11] In cases where the damage to the heart muscle is severe, a heart transplant may be necessary.[1]",Myocarditis can be fatal. Death may occur if the condition worsens after diagnosis and becomes unresponsive to treatment. It may also occur suddenly where acute myocarditis has a rapid onset.[1],Myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy,"A possible complication of myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy is a condition where the heart becomes chronically enlarged and cannot pump blood efficiently.[2] The myocardium dilates, stretching and becoming thinner. As a result, the heart weakens and heart failure may occur. Dilated cardiomyopathy may also cause arrhythmias, blood clots and heart valve problems.[16]","The risk of developing dilated cardiomyopathy from myocarditis, or in general, is low. It is estimated that, overall, two in 10,000 people develop this condition, with myocarditis only one possible cause.

,,,,,,,,,,What is neonatal jaundice,"Neonatal jaundice – otherwise known as neonatal hyperbilirubinemia – is a common and usually harmless condition that turns the skin and other parts of a newborn baby’s body yellow in color.[1] Jaundice is often found among newborn babies. In fact, it is the most common disorder for which newborns receive medical attention and/or are (re)admitted to hospital. The condition is caused by excessive levels of the chemical compound bilirubin in the tissues of the body.","Although neonatal jaundice is normally a non-serious condition, babies experiencing the disorder should always be seen by a doctor or midwife, who will be able to advise on a method of treatment where necessary. In very rare cases, when the levels of bilirubin are very high, serious complications are possible.[1]",Symptoms of neonatal jaundice,"The main symptom of neonatal jaundice is a yellowing of the skin and other parts of the body. As the condition progresses, the whites of the eyes may take on a yellow tinge.","Symptoms will typically begin in the region of the face and gradually progress down the body to the legs. This progression may be unidentifiable in some cases, with the discoloration appearing to occur across the whole body all at once. If there is any doubt about skin discoloration, possible in babies with dark skin, this can be checked by pressing a finger down on the skin. In cases of jaundice, the skin should appear yellow  when the finger is released.[2]",Signs that neonatal jaundice is worsening include:,"
Yellow skin below the knee
Yellow skin becoming more intense in colour
Difficulty feeding the baby
Difficulty waking the baby
Irritability
The baby arching his/her neck or body backwards
","If any of these signs occur, immediate medical attention should be sought. If you are concerned that a child you are for has neonatal jaundice, you can do a free symptom assessment with the Ada app at any time.",Causes of neonatal jaundice,"Neonatal jaundice is caused by a buildup of the chemical compound bilirubin in the blood. Normally, the liver breaks down bilirubin and disposes of it through urine and stool. If bilirubin is produced faster than it can be broken down, jaundice occurs.","Newborns process bilirubin more slowly than adults, because their liver and intestines are not yet completely mature. The breakdown of red blood cells in infants can be related to:[2][3]","
Bruising or mild injury to the newborn during delivery.
An incompatibility between the mother’s blood type and that of the baby, which may cause the mother’s immune system to attack the baby’s red blood cells.
Hereditary causes of red blood cell breakdown, such as a deficiency of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PD). This is more common among people of an African-American, Asian or Mediterranean ancestry.
Asian ancestry. In Asians, the ability to remove bilirubin takes longer to develop.
","A slight increase in the breakdown of red blood cells, combined with a liver that is not functioning very well, can therefore lead to jaundice.[3] Generally, bilirubin production slows down significantly a few weeks after birth, once the liver and intestines are fully developed.[2][3]",Physiological jaundice,"Physiological jaundice is the most common form of the condition and is largely harmless. It usually begins two days after birth, reaches its peak at four days and disappears after seven to ten days. This type of neonatal jaundice is caused by a mild accumulation of bilirubin.",Prolonged jaundice,"Jaundice in infants is classified as prolonged jaundice if symptoms persist for 14 days or longer after birth; this can be 21 days in premature babies.[4] The condition is usually caused by breastfeeding (see FAQs below), but may indicate a more serious problem. A doctor will be able to identify the cause behind prolonged jaundice and recommend treatment.",Other types of neonatal jaundice,"Neonatal jaundice will usually disappear after the liver has had time to fully develop and red blood cell breakdown has naturally slowed. If this does not happen, it may be that the condition is being caused by other factors. Additional signs that this is the case may include:","
The baby is unwell, e.g. not feeding well or unusually  irritable or appears a lot quieter than usual
Symptoms of jaundice are present in the first 24 hours after birth
Symptoms of jaundice are still present two weeks after birth
The baby has pale, chalky stools
The baby has urine that causes dark stains on the nappy
","These symptoms may indicate that the baby has more severe hyperbilirubinemia, and in these cases it will be especially important to seek medical attention without delay.","Factors that may cause a more serious form of neonatal jaundice include blood or liver conditions, as well as blood type incompatibility with the mother. When a baby and mother have incompatible blood types, the mother’s blood can destroy red blood cells in the baby and cause jaundice.",Diagnosing neonatal jaundice,"Babies are checked for neonatal jaundice as part of the routine medical examination which typically takes place within 72 hours of birth. As the condition can take up to one week to appear, the baby should also be checked frequently after being taken home. Parents should monitor for yellowing of the skin and eyes, as well as for bright yellow urine and abnormally pale stool. If jaundice is suspected, parents should contact a doctor or midwife who will then usually recommend a bilirubin test.[5]",Bilirubin test,"If jaundice is suspected, a test to measure the levels of bilirubin in the blood will usually be carried out. This will either be done using an instrument known as a bilirubinometer, which uses light to test for bilirubin, or through a blood test. A blood test is generally only used if symptoms appear within 24 hours of birth or if the results from the bilirubinometer show particularly high levels.",The results of a bilirubin test will be used to decide on an appropriate treatment route for the condition.,Neonatal jaundice treatment,"Treatment for neonatal jaundice is aimed at reducing the levels of bilirubin in the blood. In mild cases, no treatment at all may be required other than monitoring the child, making sure that the jaundice improves.","In other cases, treatment may be necessary and  options include:",Phototherapy,Phototherapy is the most common treatment option for babies with jaundice and is in the majority of cases the only treatment method that is necessary for recovery.,"Phototherapy involves exposing the baby’s skin to special blue light, which is able to break down bilirubin into a harmless substance. For the best results, the baby should be exposed to the light for as long as possible. This will usually take place at the hospital, but in some cases may be possible to do it at home.","Generally, phototherapy is very safe, though the infant’s eyes will need to be protected from the light, and temporary side-effects such as dehydration, a skin rash and loose stool may result. These are all treatable.",Intravenous immunoglobulins,"Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment is used for the treatment of blood group, Rhesus (Rh), ABO and other blood group incompatibilities. It is believed to reduce the need for exchange transfusions.","Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy may not be very helpful for babies that are already immunized, but it has been shown to be beneficial to babies that would otherwise need an exchange transfusion. The reasons behind this are not completely understood. In some cases, it may be necessary to try IVIG preparations from various manufacturers if the initial treatment does not work.","Generally, IVIG preparations are infused intravenously over a period of a few hours. The process can be repeated, and combined with phototherapy.",Exchange transfusion,"In emergency situations, when very high levels of bilirubin need to be reduced quickly, an exchange transfusion may be required. This is a procedure in which some of the baby’s blood is replaced with donor blood. This can be effective in bringing down bilirubin levels quickly.",Complications of neonatal jaundice,"In the majority of cases, neonatal jaundice is a harmless condition that leads to no serious complications. However, serious complications which can lead to both temporary and permanent disability can occur, albeit rarely.","The most common complication of neonatal jaundice is kernicterus, which typically affects premature babies or – in a minority of cases – babies with very high bilirubin levels. Signs of kernicterus include:[6]","
Severe jaundice within the first few days of birth
Difficulty feeding
High-pitched cry
Arched neck or back
","Treating kernicterus usually involves phototherapy or, in emergency situations, an exchange transfusion. If kernicterus is not detected and treated early, it can cause long-term damage, including a certain form of cerebral palsy (athetoid cerebral palsy), sensory disability and, in rare cases, mortality.",Neonatal jaundice FAQs,"Q: Can breastfeeding cause neonatal jaundice?
A: Neonatal jaundice is most common in infants who are breastfed. There are two main mechanisms behind breastfeeding-related jaundice.","In breastfeeding jaundice, which occurs within one week of birth, the problem is that the baby is not getting sufficient breast milk. This leads to low calorie intake and to inadequate numbers of bowel movements, which means that bilirubin is not removed from the body. It therefore recirculates in the intestines, where more bilirubin is absorbed.","Treatment for breastfeeding jaundice is with rehydration, i.e.making sure the baby receives adequate fluids,  and increased breastfeeding sessions.","In breast milk jaundice, which occurs within two weeks of birth and can last for between four and 13 weeks, the cause is an interplay between a substance in breast milk and the baby’s digestive tract.  Increased level of beta-glucuronidase in the mother’s breast milk, combined with a low population of gut bacteria in the baby’s digestive tract, causes the bilirubin in the infant’s body to be re-absorbed and thus stay in the body. This causes jaundice to persist.","Treatment is by continued breastfeeding, supplemented with formula feeding. Phototherapy can be used in addition if necessary.","Jaundice should not be considered a reason to cease breastfeeding a baby, however, as long as the baby is feeding adequately and gaining weight.","Q: How can neonatal jaundice be prevented? .
A: Although neonatal jaundice is a very common problem among newborn babies, there are ways to reduce the chance of it developing. The key mechanism is to prevent bilirubin from remaining in the body, and this is done by:[7]","
Frequent breastfeeding with adequate amounts of breast milk increases the infant’s gut motility (how often the gut moves) and frequency of bowel movements, which result in greater removal of bilirubin from the body and consequently less risk of jaundice.
Protein-rich feeds, whether through special formula or breast milk. These inhibit jaundice by preventing bilirubin being reabsorbed and recirculated by the body.
In dehydrated babies, rehydrating with a protein-rich feeding solution rather than with glucose or water.

Common causes are infections, immune system disorders and inflammation of the blood vessels. The main symptoms are passing less urine than normal, leading to a fluid buildup in the body, and having blood in the urine. People with nephritic syndrome also often develop high blood pressure.","Treatment depends on the underlying cause, but usually involves managing the high blood pressure and reducing the inflammation in the kidneys. Although many people recover well from nephritic syndrome, some people may go on to develop renal failure. The risk of renal failure depends on the severity of the syndrome and its underlying cause.","Nephritic syndrome is not a disease but a syndrome. A syndrome is a group of symptoms that often and predictably occur together, and which develop as a result of another condition. Syndromes are not necessarily specific to any disease or disorder. Nephritic syndrome has many potential triggers, therefore, successfully treating it involves identifying the underlying cause.[1]","Nephritic syndrome has both acute and chronic forms. Acute, or rapidly-progressing, nephritic syndrome usually comes on suddenly and, because of acute and painful symptoms, seldom goes undetected. Chronic nephritic syndrome typically progresses slowly and often goes undetected for some time. [2]","Chronic inflammation of the kidneys can cause scarring, which may negatively impact kidney function and lead to high blood pressure and, eventually, if left undiagnosed and untreated, to a need for dialysis (renal replacement therapy, when a dialysis machine replaces the kidneys’ function and filters waste products from the blood), and possibly kidney transplantation.[3]",What causes nephritic syndrome?,"Nephritic syndrome is the result of inflammation affecting small groups of blood vessels, known as glomeruli, in the kidneys. As the glomeruli are the kidneys’ main filter units, this inflammation disrupts the kidneys’ ability to adequately filter blood. The inflammation can originate in the kidneys themselves or be the result of infection or injury elsewhere in the body.[2] It can occur in people of any age, including children.",Nephritic syndrome can develop as a result of any of the following:[1][4],Primary glomerular diseases: Such as IgA nephropathy (Berger’s disease) or membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. IgA nephropathy is a very common cause of nephritic syndrome.[5],"Bacterial infections: Such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), pneumococcal pneumonia, typhoid, infective endocarditis, or secondary syphilis. Nephritic syndrome following a streptococcal throat infection is fairly common, especially in children.","Viral infections: Such as hepatitis B, mumps, measles, chicken pox or glandular fever (mononucleosis).","Multisystem systemic/inflammatory diseases: Such as vasculitis, Goodpasture’s Syndrome, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Henoch-Schönlein purpura, or lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus).",Abdominal abscess: A pocket of infected fluid and pus inside the abdominal cavity. This can be located on or near any organ.,Parasitic infections: Such as malaria.,"As there are many underlying conditions for nephritic syndrome, there are different risk factors, such as recent infections, immune system disorders and genetic disorders. See the sections below for more information on the relationship between nephritic syndrome and glomerulonephritis, and nephritic syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus.",Nephritic syndrome symptoms,"Typical symptoms include passing less urine than normal, having blood in the urine and swelling of the feet or face (edema). Other possible symptoms are flank pain, back pain, headache, shortness of breath and symptoms related to the underlying cause, for example rash and joint pain.","The symptoms of nephritic syndrome differ, depending on whether the acute or chronic form of the syndrome is present.",Symptoms of acute nephritic syndrome include:[1][2][4],"
Edema in the face and legs: Edema is the accumulation of fluids in the body, usually under the skin, leading to a puffy appearance.
Low urine volume: Known as oliguria, this is defined as less than 500ml of urine being produced in a 24-hour period.
Hematuria: Blood in the urine which often, but not necessarily, leads to red discoloration. There are two types of hematuria: microhematuria, which indicates unseen blood, and macrohematuria, in which the blood is visible to the eye.
High blood pressure: Hypertension, which results from the disruption of kidney function, may also occur. High blood pressure is generally defined as a resting blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg or higher in adults,[6]. In children, what constitutes hypertension depends on the age and size of the child.
Fever, weakness and fatigue
Appetite loss, vomiting and abdominal pain
Malaise (a feeling of general unwellness) and nausea may also be present.
","Chronic nephritic syndrome usually presents with fairly mild or even undetectable symptoms, which can include:[2]","
Edema
Hypertension/high blood pressure
Kidney failure in later stages
",Symptoms of kidney failure can include:,"
Itchy skin and/or rash
Decreased appetite
Nausea
Vomiting
Fatigue
Difficulty breathing
","In both chronic and acute nephritic syndrome, the urine will usually contain high concentrations of red blood cells, as the blood cells leak out of the damaged glomeruli. If you are concerned that you or someone you love may have nephritic syndrome, consult the Ada app for a free symptom assessment.",Diagnosing nephritic syndrome,"The diagnosis of nephritic syndrome is typically based on a physical examination of the person and analysis of their urine (urinalysis). People with nephritic syndrome tend to have high blood pressure, so a doctor will check this. A doctor will also look for signs of:","
Abnormalities, such as dark color or cloudiness in the urine
Protein in the urine (proteinuria), which may indicate nephrotic syndrome
Uremia, an excess of urea or creatinine in the blood, or azotemia, an excess of nitrogen-rich waste compounds in the blood
Increased fluid volume in the body, which may lead to edema
Reduced filtration in the kidneys, specifically the glomeruli
",A kidney biopsy (tissue sample from the kidney) may be performed to investigate the cause of the nephritic syndrome.,"Urinalysis, blood tests and diagnostic procedures","Because nephritic syndrome is a cluster of symptoms rather than a disease in itself, much of the testing that makes up the diagnosis is aimed at determining what the underlying cause is. Another important element in diagnosis is differential diagnosis, as the illness may be nephrosis rather than nephritis.","In examining a person with potential nephritic syndrome, a doctor might carry out the following tests:[1]",Take patient history: A doctor will ask the affected person about the time at which their symptoms began and attempt to determine the point at which the kidneys began to excrete protein into the urine.,Check appearance and colour of urine: Urine that is dark in colour may be very concentrated and contain blood.,Blood pressure: Hypertension can be a sign of disrupted kidney function.,"Edema assessment: Edema, or fluid gathering in the tissues, can be a sign that there is not enough protein in the blood and may suggest proteinuria.","Urine dipstick test: A simple form of urinalysis that is used as a quick test for blood and protein in the urine. They will use a dipstick test, in which a test-strip of paper is immersed in a urine sample, to check for blood and protein in the urine",Urinalysis: A urine sample will be sent to a laboratory to do a precise check for protein levels and red blood cells.,"Blood tests: To check levels of electrolytes, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, immunoglobulins, antibodies, and other substances.","Kidney biopsy: This relatively straightforward procedure may be performed as an outpatient procedure or after hospital admission, depending on the patient’s particular circumstances. It uses only local anesthetic and is done using ultrasound and specialized biopsy needles to remove a small sample of tissue.[7] Kidney biopsies are a very reliable way of distinguishing chronic glomerulonephritis from other, similar, disorders.[2]",Treatment of nephritic syndrome,"Treatment depends on the underlying causes. Medications (such as ramipril, benazepril, candesartan, or valsartan) are typically used to treat the high blood pressure. Medications will also be administered to reduce inflammation in the kidneys.","Generally, doctors will recommend:[1]","
Bed rest
A diet that is restricted in salt, potassium and fluid
Medication to control blood pressure, if necessary
Medication to reduce inflammation
Medication to remove fluids from the body
Dialysis to replace kidney function in severe cases
","The time it takes to recover from nephritic syndrome varies according to its severity and the underlying cause.  Most patients begin to feel better fairly soon, especially if treatment is prompt.",Nephritic syndrome and other kidney disorders,"Kidney disorders are complex and may not be entirely distinguishable from one another without extensive testing. The terminology can also be hard to grasp. Some associated conditions, include:[2][8]","
Acute nephritis
Acute glomerulonephritis and rapidly-progressive glomerulonephritis
Rapidly-progressive glomerulonephritis
Chronic glomerular disease
Lupus nephritis
",Nephrotic syndrome versus nephritic syndrome,"Both nephritis and nephrosis are among the body’s responses to injury or illness affecting the kidneys. Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by severe proteinuria, i.e. high amounts of protein, including albumin, in the urine, while nephritic syndrome’s major feature is inflammation. Depending on the specific underlying conditions of the two, nephrotic syndrome often is the more serious.[9] In both cases, medical care should be sought as a matter of urgency. Doctors will usually need to order tests to determine whether a patient has nephritic or nephrotic syndrome.[9][8][10]",Nephritic syndrome and acute glomerulonephritis,"Glomerulonephritis refers to a number of kidney problems that involve inflammation in the glomeruli, which are the kidney’s filtration units. Acute glomerulonephritis can cause nephritic syndrome. Glomerulonephritis can be acute (sudden onset, lasting for a short time) or chronic (long-lasting), and it can result from a variety of factors, such as:[11]","
Infections, especially those involving streptococcal bacteria
Autoimmune conditions, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (see below)
Hereditary factors
","Edema, hematuria and hypertension are known as the nephritic triad.","Acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN) generally, and rapidly-progressive glomerulonephritis (RPG) occasionally result from infections.[12][13]","The symptoms of acute glomerulonephritis resemble those of acute nephritic syndrome, and include:[14][15]","
Edema, often showing first as facial puffiness in the morning
Hematuria: blood in the urine, which can color it pink, red or brown
Oliguria: producing less urine than usual
Hypertension: high blood pressure
Fatigue: feeling tired, weak and/or exhausted (almost) constantly
",Edema can also cause shortness of breath and coughing.,Post-infectious glomerulonephritis and acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis,"Post-infectious glomerulonephritis is a common cause of acute glomerulonephritis, especially among children. It can be caused by a wide range of conditions and factors, including viral infections such as Epstein-Barr virus infection, the flu or Hepatitis B, and bacterial infections such as staphylococcal, pneumococcal and streptococcal infections. It commonly occurs after streptococcal infections.[16]",Some conditions that can increase a person’s risk of developing post-infectious glomerulonephritis are for example:[12][16],"
Sore throat, usually pharyngitis
Skin infections
Diabetes
Alcoholism
Malignancies such as cancer or leukemia
Heart-valve replacement surgery
HIV infection
Intravenous drug use
","In acute postinfectious glomerulonephritis, the symptoms typically appear some weeks after the infection that triggered it has cleared up. This is typically within one to two weeks after pharyngitis or up to a month after a skin infection. If symptoms appear within a few days, however, it is possible that there are existing renal problems.[12]",Symptoms of acute postinfectious glomerulonephritis include the nephritic triad:[13][14][15],"
Hematuria, causing red, pink, brown or cola-colored urine
Edema, causing facial puffiness and swelling in the legs and arms
Hypertension, or high blood pressure
","Oliguria, or reduced urine output, is less common, occurring in less than half of cases. Urinalysis can confirm hematuria even if no blood is visible in the urine; in this case it is called microscopic hematuria.","Acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN) usually follows an infection, typically a streptococcal infection of the throat or skin, but also may result from mild infections that follow other illnesses or surgical procedures. APSGN is a post-infectious glomerulonephritis.","Acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is most commonly found among children between the ages of four and 12, although it is also becoming more common among people who are older than 50.[15] It is more common among men than women.","The prognosis for children with acute postinfectious glomerulonephritis is good, though it can be less positive for older people. Certain debilitating conditions may also cause the prognosis to be more serious. These include:[7]","
Malnutrition
Alcoholism
Diabetes
Chronic illnesses
HIV infection
Intravenous drug use
Cancer
","If symptoms are severe or one of the above risk factors is present, a nephrologist or pediatric nephrologist may need to be consulted additionally to a GP.","Because the condition is generally already healing by the time symptoms become apparent, this form of glomerulonephritis is usually treated by managing the symptoms and supporting recovery. This includes managing the edema and hypertension, and supporting kidney function. Any medication that is administered will be aimed at reducing hypertension and helping kidney function to return to usual. (See the section on treatment of nephritic syndrome above for more information.)","Good to know: Rapidly-progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) is another form of post-infectious glomerulonephritis, but it may also occur for reasons not connected to an  infection; post-infection RPGN is only one type of RPGN. Post-infection RPGN often occurs in the month following a bout of flu-like symptoms.
The exact symptoms of rapidly-progressive glomerulonephritis depend on what underlying condition causes it, but may include:[13][17]","
Weakness
Fatigue
Fever
Nausea and vomiting
Appetite loss and therefore unintended weight loss
Joint pain
Muscle pain
Painful skin lesions
Abdominal pain
Nausea and vomiting
Edema
Low urine production
","Treatment for rapidly-progressive glomerulonephritis must be sought as quickly as possible. The disorder can cause damage before it becomes symptomatic, so the long-term prognosis depends on a rapid response once symptoms are apparent.","Rarely, a case of rapidly-progressive glomerulonephritis involving the lungs may occur. This is called pulmonary-renal syndrome. People with this condition may also, in addition to having the above-mentioned renal symptoms, cough up blood. This combination of coughing up blood and renal symptoms is an emergency that may lead to kidney and lung failure. Urgent medical treatment should be sought without delay. If you are concerned that you or a loved one may have a post-infection kidney problem, consult the Ada app for a free symptom assessment.",Nephritic syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus,"Systemic lupus erythematosus, often known simply as lupus, is an autoimmune disease that can affect any of the body’s systems.[18] Lupus mostly affects women. Lupus affecting the kidneys is known as lupus nephritis, a kind of inflammation of the kidneys. About half of all people with lupus are affected by lupus nephritis. In children with lupus, about eight out of ten will have lupus nephritis.[19]","In lupus nephritis, inflammation inside the kidney causes glomerulonephritis and therefore nephritic syndrome.[20] In the early stages of this disorder and sometimes even later, there may be no symptoms of anything being wrong with the kidneys, although lupus nephritis may be diagnosed using urine tests and kidney biopsy at any time.[18] Lab tests in people with lupus nephritis show proteinuria and hematuria, even if they are asymptomatic.",Symptoms of lupus nephritis include:[19][21][20],"
Edema: puffiness or swelling in the feet, ankles, legs, hands, face and eyelids
Foamy or red, brown, or pink urine
Weight gain
Joint pain or swelling in the joints
Headache
Dizziness
Blood clotting problems
Hypertension (high blood pressure)
","Foamy urine is a sign of proteinuria, or protein in the urine. Pink, red or brown urine is a sign of hematuria, i.e. blood in the urine. Muscle pain and a butterfly rash on the face may also occur, but these are general symptoms of lupus and not specific to lupus nephritis. For more information on the symptoms of lupus, see this resource.","Good to know: Lupus itself often affects the kidneys, but does not cause kidney infections in the same way that something like a urinary tract infection may. While Lupus nephritis is not itself a kidney infection, meaning it is not caused by bacteria, viruses or other infectious causes, medications used to treat lupus can suppress the immune system, potentially leading to an increased risk of infections of the kidneys. [20]","If you are concerned that you or a loved one may have lupus or a kidney problem, consult the Ada app for a free symptom assessment.",Diagnosing lupus nephritis,"Diagnosis of lupus nephritis involves urine and blood tests and often  a kidney biopsy. Urine tests are used to measure the levels of protein, red blood cells and creatinine in the urine. High levels of creatinine indicate that the kidneys are not filtering wastes out of the blood very well. The same is true of high levels of protein in the urine. High levels of protein in the urine also may indicate that nephrotic syndrome is present.[19] A blood urea nitrogen, or BUN, test may also be done using a blood sample taken from a vein. This test will also be an indication of how compromised the filtering capabilities of the kidneys are.[22] A kidney biopsy, which is an outpatient procedure, will confirm the presence of lupus nephritis and determine how badly the kidneys are affected. In a kidney biopsy, a needle is used to take a small sample of kidney tissue, which will be sent to a laboratory for analysis.",Treatment of lupus nephritis,"Lupus nephritis is usually treated using medication to reduce inflammation, decrease the severity of the body’s auto-immune response and prevent the body from attacking the kidneys. Commonly-used medications include:[23][24]","
Corticosteroids
Hydroxychloroquine
Cyclophosphamide
Mycophenolic acid
Azathioprine
","Managing the hypertension that accompanies nephritic syndrome in glomerulonephritis also requires medication, which can include:[19][25]","
ACE inhibitors
Other Diuretics
Beta-blockers
Calcium-channel blockers
","The goal of treatment for lupus nephritis is to support kidney function and keep it as normal as possible, while preventing it from becoming worse.[21]","Treatment for lupus nephritis works well, so the prognosis is generally good. However, lupus nephritis can cause kidney function to decline as time goes by, and between 10-30 percent of people with lupus nephritis may develop kidney failure.[19] Very severe lupus nephritis may cause diffuse proliferative nephritis, which causes scarring to accumulate in the kidneys. This scarring causes kidney function to decline or, in the worst case, even fail.",Nephritic syndrome FAQs,"Q: Is nephritic syndrome dangerous during pregnancy?
A: Nephritic syndrome indicates a problem with the kidneys, which is of great concern for pregnant people, whose kidneys and other internal organs are already adapting to pregnancy and thus under increased demand. A doctor should be consulted without delay if symptoms occur. Acute nephritic syndrome poses certain health risks to both mother and baby. Chronic nephritic syndrome, though rarer, is also of concern. If nephrotic syndrome occurs, complications for both mother and baby may occur, even if renal function isn’t badly affected.[^11] Mothers may experience postnatal problems, such as edema, urinary tract infections and anemia.[26]  A doctor should be consulted as soon as possible.","Q: Can I take painkillers if I have or have had nephritic syndrome?
A: There is some evidence that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) can worsen existing kidney damage or lead to kidney damage if used in high amounts exceeding the standard dosages over time. Normal dosages, when taken only as directed, are safe.[27] NSAIDs include diclofenac , celecoxib, etoricoxib, indometacin, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, high-dose aspirin (above 300mg per dose), mefenamic acid, and naproxen.[28]  High doses of NSAIDs over time can lead to chronic interstitial nephritis. Patients with kidney problems should use NSAIDs only under the direct supervision of a doctor.","Opioids such as morphine, hydrocodone or oxycodone, should generally be avoided, except in post-surgical or severe long-term pain, and would not ordinarily be prescribed by physicians due to their addictive properties.","Acetaminophen, also known as paracetamol, is generally a safe painkiller for use by people with kidney problems or suspected kidney problems. However, overuse of acetaminophen can lead to liver damage. Acetaminophen reduces pain and fever, but is not an anti-inflammatory.[29]","However, all patients should consult a doctor before taking NSAIDs or any other painkillers."
,,,,,,,,,,What is nephrolithiasis (kidney stones)?
,,,,,,,,,,What is nephrolithiasis (kidney stones)?,"Kidney stones, or nephrolithiasis, is a common condition in which hard collections, or calculi, form in the renal system, usually in the tube between the kidney and the bladder. These collections are the result of urine becoming saturated with minerals such as calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, struvite, uric acid or cystine.[1]",Common types of stone are:[2][3],"
Calcium oxalate stones
Calcium phosphate stones
Uric acid stones
Struvite stones
Cystine stones
","Around 80 percent of all kidney stones, also called calculi, are calcium stones.[4]","These stones can vary in size from a few millimeters to a large staghorn shape a few centimeters in length.[1] Kidney calculi are more common in men than in women, and tend to occur in adults between the ages of 20 and 50. People between the ages of 35 and 45 are the most likely to be affected, but the disease can affect people of any age. It is rare to develop a stone for the first time over the age of 50.[5] Over half a million people in the US are affected by kidney stones every year.[5] Kidney stones are more common in whites and Asians than in people with African, Native American or African-American heritage.[3]","Symptoms occur when a stone leaves the kidney and enters the tighter ureter, the tube between the kidney and bladder, on its way to the bladder. A stone that is moving is much more painful than a stone that has not moved from its original place.[4]","Typical symptoms are severe pain in the back and belly, difficulty urinating and red or brown urine. Common treatment methods include good hydration, pain relief and anti-emetics. About 20% of patients require procedures such as  lithotripsy, breaking up the calculus with shock waves, to remove the stones, when kidney stones have caused pain, infection or obstruction. Most people recover fully, without any complications.",Signs and symptoms of kidney stones,"Typical symptoms are severe pain at the back and flank, difficulty urinating and passing only small amounts of urine at a time. The pain is often cramping or like a spasm and tends to come in waves. Some people might also have nausea, vomiting and may pass red or brown urine. Symptoms occur when a stone leaves the kidney and enters the tighter ureter, the tube between the kidney and bladder.",Other symptoms of kidney stones include:[1][6],"
Nausea and vomiting, which diminish as pain is relieved
Fever and chills
Blood in the urine, known as hematuria

However, men may experience the pain from a kidney stone slightly differently. In men, the pain from a kidney stone may radiate into the groin or the testicles. However, this does not mean that the stone is present in the testicles or in the groin.",Signs and symptoms of kidney stones in women,"As stated above, men and women experience the symptoms of kidney stones in much the same way. The general symptoms of pain, nausea, fever, cloudy or bad-smelling urine, bloody urine, lack of urine or urinary retention, and stones or gravel in the urine will be experienced in the same way.",What does the pain from kidney stones feel like?,"Pain is one of the most obvious symptoms of kidney stone obstructions. Where the pain is felt, and where it radiates to in the body, can indicate where the calculus is within the renal system. The pain that accompanies a kidney stone is felt acutely in the flank (the side) and radiates down the groin on the same side. Not all stones cause pain that spreads. Some stones may cause no pain at all.","Pain is caused not directly by the kidney stone itself, but instead it results from the effect that the stone has on the body by leading to muscle spasms, inflammation and irritation at and around the site of the obstruction.[5] Factors that influence how painful the kidney stone is, include:[4]","
Whether the stone is moving
Whether it is twisted or tilted in the ureter or urethra
Whether the obstruction is complete or partial
Where exactly it is in the renal system
How big the stone is
","Good to know: Pain from kidney stones is often described as excruciating and intermittent, and often occurs in cycles that last between 20 minutes and an hour. People with painful kidney stones often cannot keep still because of the pain. They are often ashen, pale and sweaty, with a tender abdomen.[6]",Worried that you might have kidney stones? Ada is ready to start your free symptom assessment.,Risk factors and causes of kidney stones,"Kidney stones are more common in men, and in adults between 20 and 50 years of age, but very rare in children. It is most common in adults who have a low fluid intake and consequently produce little urine, which can contain high amounts of stone-forming substances.[7]","Kidney stones are also more common in people who have gout (in the case of uric acid stones), or who have a family member who also suffers from kidney stones. The genes that can increase a person’s chance of developing nephrolithiasis have been identified.[7]",Infections of the urinary tract may lead to kidney stones. Other general risk factors are dehydration and being overweight or obese.,Other risk factors include:[1][5][8][9],"
Anatomical abnormalities such as horseshoe kidney or ureteral stricture
Hyperparathyroidism, i.e. an overactive parathyroid gland
Metabolic disorders, such as hypercalciuria, hyperuricosuria or chronic metabolic acidosis
Intestinal problems such as Crohn’s Disease
Bariatric (weight-loss) surgery), such as a sleeve gastrectomy or a gastric bypass
Living in a hot climate  and its risk of dehydration
Too much exercise and its risk of dehydration
Too little exercise and its risk of obesity
A diet high in protein, salt or sugar, especially fructose and sucrose
",Some medications can increase the risk of forming kidney stones. These include among others:[4],"
Indinavir, an antiretroviral medication
Atazanavir, an antiretroviral medication
Guaifenesin, an expectorant medication
Triamterene, a medication used for the treatment of hypertension and edema
Silicate, which is used in antacids

Sulfadiazine, a drug used for the treatment of otitis media ear infections
Ceftriaxone, a drug used for the treatment of bacterial infections
","Stones caused by struvite, as opposed to calcium, are caused by urea-splitting bacteria such as Klebsiella, Pseudomonas and Proteus species, and indicate an underlying urinary tract infection. Struvite stones are more common in women than in men,[3] and are responsible for between 1 and 5 percent percent of kidney stones.[1] They will reoccur if the underlying UTI is not treated.[6]","Kidney stones caused by uric acid are associated with acidic urine, usually with a pH of below 5.5.[4] These account for only around 10% percent of stones and are often associated with gout. Chemotherapy for conditions such as leukemia and lymphoma, as well as these conditions themselves, which increase tissue breakdown, may also lead to the urine becoming more acidic.","If you are experiencing symptoms such as those listed above, and are concerned that the cause may be kidney stones, try a free Ada symptom assessment.",Diet and kidney stones,"It is generally thought that certain foods can increase risk of developing some kinds of kidney stones. These include animal protein from meats or fish, in the case of uric acid stones, and some vegetables, drinks and nuts in the case of calcium oxalate stones .[5][4] Excessive salt and excessive sucrose and fructose intake have in some studies also been shown to overall increase the risk of stones forming, and should therefore be avoided in excess and only consumed in moderation.",Calcium oxalate stones and diet,"People who have had calcium oxalate stones in the past or who have a high rate of oxalate excretion should reduce consumption of certain foods and food types, including:[10]","
Rhubarb
Spinach
Cocoa
Tea
Nuts
Vitamin C
",Uric acid stones and diet,"High intake of purine in the diet causes the body to produce large amounts of monosodium urate.

Calf thymus
Liver
Kidneys
Poultry skin
Herrings with skin
Anchovies

",Hereditary and genetic risks of kidney stones,"There is some evidence that a predisposition to developing  certain types of kidney stones may, at least partly, be hereditary.[11] Risk factors, such as high levels of uric acid in the blood and high levels of calcium in the urine, for example, may be influenced by genetic factors.[12]","Cystine stones are rare and may be caused by genetic factors[5] that cause the body to reabsorb cystine, ornithine, lysine and arginine from the kidneys. In cases where cystine stones develop, the urine is saturated to above a certain level with cystine , causing crystals to be deposited and stones to form.[4]",Diagnosing kidney stones,"Diagnosis of kidney stones is often based on the typical symptoms and physical examination. A urine dipstick test may show blood and pus in the urine, and help confirm the presence of a kidney stone.","A person being examined for kidney stones will be asked about their medical history and will be physically examined. They will also be given a computerised tomography (CT) scan. X-rays and ultrasound tests can determine the presence of stones, but CT scans are preferred during the diagnostic process, because they can determine the size and location of the stone. MRI scans are not generally helpful.[6] In pregnant women; a kidney ultrasound is usually ordered. An ultrasound of the kidneys and ureters is also often used to diagnose kidney stones in children, although in some cases a CT scan may also be needed.[13]",The overall health of the kidneys may be tested using:[2][4],"
24-hour urine collection test, once the patient is free of stones,  to measure changes in the values for urinary electrolytes, reduced urine volume and to determine the underlying metabolic cause for nephrolithiasis
Blood tests, if the person is feverish and may have an infection

",Treatment of kidney stones,The treatment of kidney stones varies depending  on the size of the kidney stone and the severity of the symptoms. Small stones usually pass with no need for medical assistance. Drinking plenty of water may help to flush the stone from the urinary system.,"Pain medication is often needed while passing a renal calculus. In severe cases, opiates may be prescribed. However, in most cases, acetaminophen/paracetamol is usually sufficient.[1][5] 80 percent of stones pass without serious medical intervention and needing no inpatient treatment. About 20 percent lead to situations that require hospitalization.[4]",People may need to be admitted to hospital if the following factors are present:[1],"
Anuria, when the kidneys do not produce urine
Fever
Persistent or severe pain
Inadequate fluid intake as a result of nausea or vomiting, resulting in dehydration
Poor social support while they are living alone at home
Inability to access follow-up outpatient care
Pregnancy
Being older than 60 years of age
","Good to know: If a fever is present, infection may also be present. Because infection can be very serious, the affected person should receive medical treatment as soon as possible.[1]","Treatment at home may be possible for most people, because most stones smaller than 5mm pass on their own and do not cause infection or need surgical help to pass. People may be cared for at home if:[1]","
Their pain has been relieved and can be managed with acetaminophen/paracetamol
They can drink fluids
They have good social support
They have no complications, such as fever or urinary blockage
",Medication for kidney stones,"Painkillers, antiemetics and antidiuretics are commonly used in both inpatient and outpatient treatment of kidney stones. Painkillers, such as morphine may be used to control severe pain; moderate or mild pain can be controlled with acetaminophen or codeine. Antibiotics are only used in cases where an infection has developed.[4]",Other medications used to treat uric acid kidney calculi are:[4],"
Uricosuric agents, which increase the amount of uric acid excreted
Alkalinizing agents, such as sodium bicarbonate and potassium citrate
",Surgery for kidney stones,"Big stones, with a diameter of more than 10mm and which are lodged in the ureter, might need assistance to pass, especially if they are blocking the passage of urine. Stones with a diameter of less than 10mm that are in the distal ureter and do not have complications such as infection, should be removed if they have not passed on their own within four to six weeks.[14] This can involve lithotripsy (breaking up the stone with shock waves), or the surgical removal of stones, or the removal of the stone with an endoscope, a small tube with a camera and surgical tools.","Shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) is a non-invasive procedure where sound waves are used to break the stones into fragments small enough to pass through the ureter and out of the body through the urethra. If lithotripsy is not used, other endoscopic methods are possible, such as uteroscopic lithotripsy (URS) or percutaneous nephrostomy.","In uteroscopic lithotripsy, an endoscope is introduced to the urethra and moves through the bladder into the ureter to the stone’s location. The stone is then removed. In cases where access to the urethra is complicated because of an enlarged prostate, the endoscope will be introduced via a small incision in the bladder.","In a percutaneous nephrostomy, an endoscope is introduced via a small incision in the skin of the flank, directly into the kidney.",Some very large or complicated stones may need open surgery.,"Struvite stones must be removed, as they are infectious or infected foreign bodies. The stones will reoccur if the urinary tract infection that underlies their formation is not resolved.[6]",Preventing kidney stones,"Preventing kidney stones from forming involves changing the diet of the affected person and increasing the amount of fluid, preferably clear fluids such as water, that they consume . In all cases, it is important to remain well hydrated, consuming about 2.5 quarts of water each day.[8] It is also important to limit sugar and salt in the diet and to eat a diet high in fruit and vegetables.[5] In cases where the person is overweight, they should lose the excess weight.","Good to know: High-animal protein diets and crash diets should be avoided, as they can unbalance the pH and chemical makeup of urine.[5] For more information, see the section on prevention of kidney stones, above.","In calcium oxalate stones, which are the most common kind, prevention measures include diets that are low in salt, sugars and animal protein,[6] and reduced consumption of oxalate-rich foods.[8]","People who are concerned about the role their diets may play in the formation of kidney stones, should consult their physicians, specialist nephrologists and/or a dietitian.","Good to know: Low-calcium diets are not indicated for the prevention of calcium oxalate stones, as low calcium diets cause oxalate reabsorption to increase.[8]","In cases of uric acid stones, allopurinol will be prescribed to prevent high levels of uric acid building up in the blood. Alkalinizing agents may also be prescribed to make urine more alkaline.",FAQs,"Q: Do kidney stones recur once they have been treated? 
A: Yes. People who have had a kidney stone, have a 50 percent chance of developing another stone within five to seven years.[5] Maintaining high fluid intake, as well as making dietary changes and maintaining a healthy weight, can help postpone the recurrence of stones.[4]","Q: Can kidney stones cause long-term kidney damage?
A: Yes. Complications can occur, in some cases within hours, that can be serious in themselves. These include sepsis and high fever. Struvite stones, as noted above, are the result of an underlying UTI, which could potentially cause long-term damage if left untreated. In some cases, pyelonephritis may result if kidney stone obstructions are left untreated, and renal damage may be permanent.","Q: What are the complications of kidney stones?
A: Complications include:","
Recurrent urinary tract infections
Urosepsis
Acute kidney injury
Glomerular damage
Chronic kidney disease
","Q: What is the difference between kidney stones and bladder stones?
A: Kidney stones develop in the kidneys and move into the ureter, bladder and urethra. Bladder stones develop in the bladder. Bladder stones make up about 5 percent of all calculi found in the renal system. They are usually the result of foreign bodies, infection and obstruction, and the most common cause of bladder stones is urinary stasis. The majority of bladder stones occur in men who have bladder outflow problems, which cause urine to remain in the bladder after urination.[1]","Q: What are some common foods that contain high levels of oxalate and may therefore need to be eaten only in very low amounts or not at all?
A: It is best to speak to a physician or dietitian before adding or eliminating foods. Not every case of kidney stones has the same cause, and therefore some of the foods listed below may not be relevant to the disease. Furthermore, this list is not exhaustive.","Some fruits, vegetable and processed foods are high in oxalate; oxalate is involved in the formation of the most common kind of stones, calcium oxalate stones. These  foods include rhubarb, spinach, beetroot, avocado, oranges, raspberries, dates, grapefruit and kiwi fruit. Nuts and nut butter may also be best avoided by some people. Bran flakes and potato chips may also be problematic.[15][16]","Q: Can coffee, tea or other caffeinated drinks cause kidney stones?
A: Coffee and tea, in fact, reduce the risk of developing kidney stones, and this is true of both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee and tea. Caffeinated drinks have a somewhat diuretic effect, which has a protective effect, while decaffeinated drinks could possibly have a protective effect due to the antioxidant chemicals they contain.[17]","Research has revealed that drinking coffee may have several different possible effects - some contrasting each other - on a person’s likelihood of developing kidney stones. Studies have shown that consuming caffeine actually increases the amount of calcium that is excreted in the urine, which should in fact increase the risk of developing calcium oxalate kidney stones [18] , which are the most common type of kidney stones. However, despite this, consuming coffee generally appears to lower the risk of kidney stones.[19]","Q: Can alcohol cause kidney stones?
A: Beer and red wine may in fact lower the risk of developing kidney stones.[17] It is not certain whether any other alcoholic beverages such as whiskey, rye, bourbon or vodka  may have a similarly protective effect, and this should therefore not be assumed. However, there are many psychological and physical health risks associated with alcohol consumption, for example, alcohol dependency and liver disease like liver cirrhosis.","Q: Can sports/energy drinks or soft drinks cause kidney stones?
A: There is some evidence that the degree to which one is consuming soft drinks or sports/energy drinks contributes to increasing one’s risk of developing kidney stones, but this depends on what is used to sweeten the drink.","Fructose is a natural sugar used to sweeten soft drinks, fruit punch, and sports drinks and it is associated with the development of gout and kidney stones, as well as obesity. While some studies have shown that fructose consumption has only a limited effect on the excretion of uric acid,[20] fructose has been shown to increase the amount of calcium, oxalate and uric acid that the body excretes in the urine.","It is possible that drinking a fructose-sweetened soda once a day increases the risk of developing kidney stones, compared to drinking artificially-sweetened soda or sports drinks.[17] Furthermore, some studies have shown that cola-based soft drinks increase the risk of developing kidney stones more than non-cola sodas.[17]","Q: How are gout and kidney stones related?
A: Both gout and some kinds of kidney stones can be caused by high levels of uric acid in the body,[21] and there is some evidence that kidney stones and chronic kidney disease are both more common in people who have gout.[22] For more information, see this resource on gout and this resource on podagra (gout affecting the big toe).","Q: Can kidney stones develop after bariatric surgery?
A: Yes; it is relatively common for someone who has had bariatric surgery to develop kidney stones. Bariatric surgery can help decrease the risk of sleep apnea, hypertension and diabetes in overweight people who have had the surgery, but some types of bariatric surgery do affect the way that the body processes nutrients.[23] It is also possible that the same factors that made bariatric surgery, such as diabetes, necessary in the first place may contribute to the risk of developing kidney stones afterwards.[23]","Q: Does a prostatectomy increase your risk of developing kidney stones?
A: No. Removal of the prostate does not affect kidney function, and therefore cannot increase your risk of developing kidney stones.","Q: Do gallstones and/or gallbladder removal increase your risk of developing kidney stones?
A: Kidney stones and gallstones are not directly related, but studies have shown that people who have gallstones may also be at higher risk of developing kidney stones and vice versa.[24] The processes that cause gallstones may be related to the processes that cause kidney stones. However, how nephrolithiasis and cholelethiasis interact isn’t yet well studied or -understood.","Q: What color are kidney stones?
A: The composition of kidney stones affects what color they are. Because the colors can vary, it is not always possible to correctly identify what kind of stone has caused the problem just by looking at it; in most cases, stones will be sent away for laboratory analysis. However, speaking broadly, the colors stones come in include:[25][26]","
Calcium oxalate: black or dark brown
Calcium phosphate: dirty white or yellowish
Uric acid: ranging from yellowish and brownish to red or orange
Struvite: dirty white or yellowish
Cystine: pinkish or yellowish, often with a grainy outer surface.

,,,,,,,,,,What is nephrotic syndrome?
,,,,,,,,,,What is nephrotic syndrome?,Nephrotic syndrome is a collection of signs and symptoms which indicate that there is a problem with the kidneys. It is a syndrome rather than a disease. A syndrome is a group of symptoms that often occur together and develop as a result of another condition.,"There can be various underlying conditions or problems, all of which require specific treatment. It can occur among adults and children, but is most common among children aged between 18 months and four years.[1] In children, boys are more commonly affected than girls.","While the prognosis is usually quite good,  nephrotic syndrome can become severe and even potentially life-threatening, if left untreated. The degree of severity depends on the underlying cause.",The major symptoms of nephrotic syndrome include:,"
The excretion of abnormally large amounts of protein, especially albumin, in the urine, known as proteinuria generally and albuminuria specifically.
Reduced levels of protein in the blood.
Consequent edema, abnormal accumulations of fluid.
","Hypertension (high blood pressure) and thrombotic events (blood clots) may also be present, as might hyperlipidemia, a high level of lipids in the blood.","Causes of nephrotic syndrome include kidney damage from nephrotoxic drugs, systemic disorders such as diabetes or lupus, or diseases affecting the kidneys directly, such as glomerulonephritis.[2] In children, most cases of nephrotic syndrome are caused by minimal change disease (MCD).","Treating nephrotic syndrome usually involves managing hypertension and hyperlipidemia, as well as alleviating edema and arresting the loss of protein in the urine. This can be done with diet and antihypertensive medications. If the nephrotic syndrome is caused by minimal change disease, steroids may be used as part of treatment.[2]",How is nephrotic syndrome different to nephritic syndrome?,"Nephritic syndrome is an inflammatory kidney disorder that is sometimes confused with nephrotic syndrome during initial diagnosis. However, there are several clear differences that are differentiated during laboratory testing. While nephritic syndrome is characterised by inflammation and hematuria (blood in urine), nephrotic syndrome is mostly characterised by proteinuria.","Of the two, nephrotic syndrome is often the more serious, depending on the underlying cause.  In both cases, medical assistance should be sought out as quickly as possible. The free Ada app can also be used to carry out a symptom assessment.",Causes of nephrotic syndrome,"Nephrotic syndrome is not a disease in itself, but rather a sign that something else is wrong in the body. Underlying conditions that can cause nephrotic syndrome can be primary, originating in the kidneys, or secondary, originating elsewhere in the body. Primary causes include:[1][3][4]","
Minimal change disease, which can cause proteinuria, mostly found among children
Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, which causes scarring of the glomeruli
Membranous nephropathy, which occurs when the glomeruli become thickened and damaged
",Secondary causes include:[1][5][6],"
Diabetic nephropathy, which results from long-term high levels of blood glucose
Pre-eclampsia
Amyloidosis, a bone-marrow disorder that causes malformed protein chains, mostly found among older adults
HIV-associated nephropathy
","Some drugs may lead to kidney damage, causing glomerulonephritis, which may then lead to nephrotic syndrome. Nephrotoxic drugs that can cause kidney damage in children include:[7]","
Cyclosporine
Aminoglycoside antibiotics
Cisplatin
Amphotericin B
Beta-lactam antibiotics
Indomethacin
",It should be noted that the circumstances in which these drugs can become nephrotoxic vary from case to case.,Other drugs that can be nephrotoxic include:[8],"
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
Radiocontrast media
Antirheumatic drugs
Anticancer drugs
","In cases where drugs are implicated in nephrotic syndrome, symptoms usually improve once the drug concerned is discontinued.",Symptoms and complications of nephrotic syndrome,Symptoms of nephrotic syndrome include:[1][9][10],"
Appetite loss
Malaise, a general feeling of unwellness
Frothy urine due to proteinuria
Edema (accumulated fluid under the skin, which may appear as weight gain)
Hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol)
Hypertension (high blood pressure)
Hypoalbuminia and albuminaria, low blood levels and high urine levels of the protein albumin.
",Proteinuria and edema are the two most distinctive symptoms of nephrotic disorder.,Proteinuria,"In a healthy kidney, small groupings of capillaries, known as glomeruli, filter the blood. The glomerulus and nearby waste tube, known as a tubule, together make up a structure called a nephron.[11]","In the nephron, the glomerulus filters the blood. Substances needed by the body, such as potassium, protein and phosphorus, return to the blood, while waste products pass through a membrane into the tubule.  Waste products pass from the tubule to the ureter, and are eventually eliminated in the urine. If the tubule, glomerulus, or both, become damaged or infected, this filtration system becomes unbalanced. Waste products may build up in the body, and necessary substances such as proteins and minerals may be lost.[11]","In glomerular disorders, such as those that lead to nephrotic syndrome, the membrane between the glomerulus and the tubule loses its ability to prevent protein molecules and red blood cells from passing out into the tubule.[12]","Healthy glomeruli allow less than 400mg of protein into urine per day. In nephrotic syndrome, three grams or more of protein pass into the urine and are lost through excretion, causing blood protein levels to fall.[2] Nephrotic range proteinuria is defined as 3.5 or more grams of protein lost in urine over a twenty-four hour period.[9] This is roughly twenty times the amount of protein a healthy glomerulus would allow through.","This has various cascading effects on the body, as the protein loss causes low levels of blood protein. Because blood protein is vital to the absorption and elimination of extra fluid from the body’s tissues, low levels of protein result in a buildup of fluids in the tissues, known as edema.","Glomerulonephritis is the most common cause for nephrotic syndrome. One specific subtype of glomerulonephritis, membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN), is the most common cause for nephrotic syndrome in adults.","Specifically, glomerulonephritis is damage to the glomerulus, often the result of attack by the body’s own immune system. It can also be the result of a streptococcal
Infection or other underlying conditions. While some cases of glomerulonephritis clear up on their own, others may take longer. In cases where the glomerulonephritis becomes chronic, long-term damage to the kidneys may occur.[13]","In MGN, also know as membranous nephropathy, the small membrane between the tubule and the glomerulus is especially affected which causes the loss of protein. In most cases, no cause for this damage can be found, but it is suggested that it is a result of an autoimmune attack on the glomeruli. This is called primary MGN. Secondary MGN can be caused by NSAIDs, Hepatitis B, systemic lupus erythematosus, cancer or others.",Edema,"In nephrotic syndrome, the lack of protein leads to a buildup of fluid made up of sodium and water in the tissues. It is usually found in the lower legs, but can build up around the lungs.[14] This is known as pleural effusion, and if this happens, the affected person may experience breathlessness. If fluid builds up in the abdominal cavity (ascites), it may be uncomfortable. Ascites, in particular, can lead to an increased abdominal circumference and a feeling of heaviness and discomfort. Most of the time, however, edema is generally not serious, although it can cause joint and abdominal pain.",Complications of nephrotic syndrome,Nephrotic syndrome can cause complications due to the way it unbalances bodily systems. Complications can include:[1][9][14][15],"
Blood clots (hypercoagulability), which occur because of abnormal protein levels in the blood
Coronary artery disease (in adults)
Thrombosis in the lungs, limbs or brain
High cholesterol (hyperlipidemia or hypercholesterolemia), due to changes in blood composition resulting from protein loss
Acute kidney injury (sudden, temporary loss of kidney function)
Anemia, due to iron no longer being adequately transported in the blood
Infections, such as cellulitis, pneumonia, meningitis and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, which result from loss of immunoglobulins. Medications used to treat these infections can themselves be nephrotoxic.
Hypothyroidism
Protein undernutrition (in children)
Hematuria (blood in the urine)
Severe azotemia, high levels of nitrogen compounds in the blood
","Hypercoagulability and hyperlipidemia are the result of abnormal protein synthesis. As albumin is lost in the urine, the liver compensates by producing more. But because protein synthesis is nonspecific, and not all proteins are being lost in the urine, the levels of some proteins actually rise in the blood.","Good to know: Hypoalbuminemia (low albumin) can also manifest as white bands in the nails, known as Muerkhe’s Lines.[16]",People experiencing symptoms that may be linked to a complication of nephrotic syndrome can carry out a symptom assessment using the free Ada app now.,Diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome,"Nephrotic syndrome is initially diagnosed using urine testing, as well as a physical examination. Visible edema is considered a sign that kidney function might be disturbed, but urine tests for protein generally, and albumin in particular, are considered specific tests.[16]","Albumin levels can be determined by a dipstick test, but a larger urine sample is needed if diagnosis if to be confirmed. Formerly, a twenty-four hour collection of the affected person’s urine would be tested for albumin, but this is considered less efficient than a single-sample test, and is being phased out.[14]",The most common urine test performed by medical professionals is a test on a single urine sample gathered first thing upon waking. This test measures albumin and creatinine in ratio. A ratio of 30mg of albumin to one gram of creatinine signals that there is a problem.[9] Urine samples will also be checked for cell casts and lipids.[1],"Depending on the result of the urine test, blood tests will be carried out to determine what the underlying cause of the nephrotic syndrome might be. While these tests can usually isolate secondary causes, a kidney biopsy may also be needed to diagnose primary causes.[9]",Blood tests for underlying causes may include:[1],"
HbA1c to determine whether diabetes is present.
Hepatitis B and C tests
Rheumatoid factor
HIV antibody tests
Serologic syphilis tests
","In children, treatment with steroids is often begun without waiting for biopsy results. This is because nephrotic syndrome is usually the result of minimal change disease. Biopsy may be likewise unnecessary in the case of adults with diabetes, given that diabetic nephropathy is a very common underlying cause.[10]",Treatment of nephrotic syndrome,"Treatment of nephrotic syndrome usually involves a combination of supportive treatment intended to alleviate symptoms such as proteinuria, hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and treatment of the underlying cause.[2] Steps should also be taken to prevent possible complications. Treatment is broadly the same, whatever the underlying cause.[16]","While some cases of nephrotic syndrome go into remission whether or not treatment is administered, it is generally not advisable to wait and see, and medical advice should be sought without delay.[10] Prognosis in cases of nephrotic syndrome is generally good, but this depends on the underlying cause and how effectively it is treated.",Treatment may include:[2][1][9],"
Angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors
Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB)
Salt/sodium restriction in the diet
Diuretics to reduce blood pressure and edema
Statins to lower cholesterol
","ACEs and ARBs lower blood pressure, which reduces the pressure inside the glomeruli. They also prevent protein loss in the urine. Increasing protein consumption in the diet does not alleviate protein loss and is not advised. Blood-thinning medications should only be prescribed if the affected person has had a blood clot already. If possible, people with nephrotic syndrome should be vaccinated against pneumococcal disease.[9]",Nephrotic syndrome FAQs,"Q: What is the link between non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and nephrotic syndrome?
A: In recent years, doctors have seen an increase in the number of cases of kidney injury and nephrotic syndrome resulting from long-term use of NSAIDs. It is most often found in adults, usually in more senior people, but is also possible among children.[17]. Younger adults are seldom affected.[18] In most cases, the situation improves when use of the drug is discontinued.[19] However, in rare cases, chronic renal insufficiency may occur.","It is likely that NSAIDs, which reduce blood-flow to the kidneys, can, in some instances, change the permeability of the membrane that separates the glomerulus from the tubule in the nephron, leading to nephrotic syndrome.[19]  NSAIDs can also cause lesions in the kidneys, leading to a problem known as acute interstitial nephritis (AIN).[20]","Q: What are NSAIDs?
A: NSAIDs are a class of medications that are commonly sold over the- counter and reduce pain and inflammation. For this reason, they are often used to relieve headaches, fever and pain from mild injuries. NSAIDs work by blocking the actions of an enzyme known as cyclooxygenase, which reduces prostaglandins in the body. Prostaglandins promote inflammation, pain and fever. Thus, if they are blocked, those symptoms are reduced. However, because prostaglandins also protect the stomach, long-term use of NSAIDs can also cause stomach ulcers.",The list of medications classified as NSAIDs includes:[21],"
Ibuprofen
Aspirin
Diclofenac
Celecoxib
Ketoprofen
Naproxen
Indomethacin
Oxaprozin
Piroxicam
","Many over-the-counter NSAIDs come packaged with a warning not to use them continuously for more than ten days without consulting a primary care physician. If your pain does not respond well to NSAIDs, seek further medical advice.","Q: If I have nephrotic syndrome, will I need to have dialysis?
A: Dialysis is typically only necessary for people whose kidney function has fallen too low for the body to adequately eliminate its own waste products. Many people who need dialysis only need it temporarily. However, depending on the cause of the renal failure, some people may need dialysis for the foreseeable future, until a kidney transplant becomes possible, or for the rest of their lives. As nephrotic syndrome is a sign of a greater underlying problem, whether you will need dialysis depends on the underlying condition.[2]","People with diabetic nephropathy, chronic kidney disease, chronic glomerulonephritis or polycystic kidney disease may all develop kidney failure and need long-term dialysis.[22] Those with acute kidney failure may only need dialysis for the short-term."

This interrupted sleep may cause daytime sleepiness, difficulty concentrating, memory problems, headaches and irritability. In children, the symptoms may be less obvious, but may include learning and behavior problems.",Diagnosis,"The diagnosis is often based on the symptoms, physical examination and, if possible, a description of these episodes from someone who has watched the affected person sleep. To confirm the diagnosis, sleep will be observed in a clinic, and monitored for the signs of sleep apnea. This examination is called polysomnography or a sleep study. The test includes monitoring brain waves, movements of chest and abdomen, the airflow through mouth and nose, blood oxygen level and heart activity.",Treatment,"Treatment for this condition involves lifestyle changes and devices which help to keep the airways open. People with obstructive sleep apnea can improve their symptoms by losing weight, reducing their use of cigarettes and alcohol, by taking regular exercise and avoiding sleeping on the back. In some cases an oral device or mouthpiece can help to keep the throat open. In more severe cases, a machine that delivers air through the nose and mouth can help to prevent the airways from becoming blocked. Surgery is usually considered only if other treatments failed.",Prevention,"Maintaining a healthy weight, taking regular exercise, reducing the use of cigarettes and alcohol, and sleeping not on the back can help prevent the symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea.",Other names for obstructive sleep apnea,"

,,,,,,,,,,What is onychomycosis?
,,,,,,,,,,What is onychomycosis?,"Onychomycosis (also known as tinea unguium) is a fungal infection affecting the toenails and fingernails, which occurs in about 10 percent of adults in the United States.[1] Onychomycosis more commonly affects toenails over fingernails.","The infected nail usually becomes thick and discoloured, a process which starts at the tip of the nail and progresses downwards towards the root. Infected nails may become crumbly, and it is not uncommon for part or all of the infected nail to break off. Treatment usually involves keeping the nail clean and taking a course of antimycotic (antifungal) medication.",Symptoms,"The first signs of a fungal nail infection are usually perceptible changes to the appearance of the nail(s). It is uncommon for an infected nail to cause severe pain or permanent disfigurement, but this does occur in some cases. If left untreated, fungal nail infections can cause difficulties with walking, exercising or manual tasks such as typing. The main symptoms of onychomycosis include the nail becoming:","_ Brittle
_ Broken
_ Discoloured
_ Thickened
_ Flaky
_ Lifted
_ Painful
_ Separated from the nail bed","These symptoms could also indicate that an individual is suffering from nail psoriasis, a chronic autoimmune skin disease which can affect the skin under the nail. Nail psoriasis is more common in the fingernails than the toenails and can co-occur with fungal infections of the nail.",Types of onychomycosis,"Onychomycosis is usually caused by a buildup of dermatophyte fungi. These are parasitic fungi  infecting the skin and nails, which need to reside in human or animal bodies in order to survive. Fungal infections of the nail are caused when dermatophytes burrow under the nails to breed.","Specific types of dermatophytes which commonly cause fungal nail infections include the trichophyton rubrum, the most common type of fungus to infect the nails, and trichophyton interdigitale fungi. Other fungi which can cause fungal nail infections include yeasts, such as the candida albicans and molds, such as scopulariopsis brevicaulis.","The rarest form of fungal nail infection is called proximal subungual onychomycosis. Infection usually involves the trichophyton rubrum fungus and occurs, initially, at the proximal nail fold (the base of the nail), spreading up the newly developed nail plate. This form of infection usually occurs in people whose immune system is compromised. Proximal subungual onychomycosis is a clinical marker for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).[2]",Triggers,"Wearing tight-fitting socks and shoes, which cause repetitive trauma to the toenails, is a primary cause of fungal nail infections. Onychomycosis is therefore common in people who play a lot of sport, as well as the elderly and anyone with a compromised immune system.","Moist, damp environments serve as breeding grounds for dermatophytes. Healthy people typically catch nail infections from visiting places such as:","
Communal showers
Nail salons and foot spas with inadequately cleaned instruments
Public swimming pools, jacuzzis and saunas
",Diagnosis,"If somebody is suffering from a suspected fungal nail infection, it is advisable to visit the doctor so that they can advise on a treatment plan for the infected nail(s). Fungal nail infections are diagnosed based on the visible symptoms.","Samples of nail clippings are usually sent away for a histopathology examination, the analysis of diseased tissue, in order to identify the presence of dermatophytes and decide on appropriate medication. There is a 30 percent possibility of false negatives when testing for dermatophyte cultures, so it is possible that the test may need to be repeated.[3]",Treatment,"Fungal nail infections do not get better spontaneously, so a course of treatment is always required. This usually involves a combined approach of keeping the affected nails clean to reduce irritation and inflammation, at the same time as following a course of antifungal medication. Onychomycosis is highly infectious, so it is important to begin treatment as soon as possible to minimise the risk of passing the infection to others.",Prevention and management,"There are various precautions that one can take in order to reduce the risk of spreading fungal nail infections to others and to increase the chances of a quick recovery. To look after one’s nails and prevent the spread of infection, it is recommended to:","
Change one’s socks and shoes regularly
Dry one’s hands and feet as soon as possible after exposure to water
File one’s nails to keep the edges smooth
Moisturise one’s hands, nails and cuticles daily and after contact with liquids
Select shoes and socks made of natural materials, such as cotton
Treat skin infections like Athlete’s Foot promptly to avoid the infection reaching the nails
Trim nails regularly
Use separate scissors or clippers to tend to infected nails
Wear clean, comfortable shoes
Wear gloves for housework and other manual tasks
",Medications,"In addition to keeping the site of the infection clean, someone affected by a fungal nail infection may be prescribed topical antimycotics, i.e.antifungal products to apply to the affected area. Topical medications are currently the first-line treatment for fungal nail infections.[3]",Topical medications used to treat fungal nail infections include:,"
Amorolfine nail lacquer
Tioconazole nail solution
Ciclopirox
",Always use topical antifungal products according to a doctor’s advice and/or follow the guidelines on the packet.,"In some cases, all or part of the infected nail may be removed, in order to give the topical medications the best chance to work. This treatment is usually recommended for severe or persistent nail infections. It can be carried out during a regular appointment at the doctor’s office. If the nail is removed surgically, a local anaesthetic will be applied to the affected area to ensure that the affected person will not feel pain, before the infected part of the nail is removed using a tool.[4]","An advantage of surgical removal is that it can be carried out in one appointment, and then the course of topical antimycotic medication can be started. Alternatively, a dressing containing urea can be applied to the affected nail. This must be kept dry for 10 days, during which time the urea will soften the nail, so that it can be removed painlessly by the doctor during a follow-up appointment.","After the nail is removed, if this is needed, topical medications can then be applied with best results. The infection is considered to have cleared up when the new, healthy nail starts to show visible regrowth in the nail bed.","Medications that can be applied directly to the affected area are the first-line treatment for fungal nail infections, primarily because they do not carry the risk of having the side effects that can accompany the use of oral antifungal medications (medications designed to be swallowed), which include:[5]","
Itching
Headaches
Diarrhea
A decreased sense of taste
","Courses of oral antimycotics for fungal nail infections typically last for between 6 and 12 weeks, allowing enough time for a healthy nail to grow and replace the infected one. The most common oral antimycotics for onychomycosis are itraconazole and terbinafine, which work by gradually killing the fungi that caused the infection.","The doctor will assess a person’s medical history before prescribing these medications, as they may not be suitable for everyone. People who have had liver problems should avoid terbinafine. Itraconazole has been linked to compromised heart function and may react with other medications, including pimozide, quinidine, dofetilide and levacetylmethadol (levomethadyl).",Onychomycosis FAQs,"Q: Is it always possible to cure onychomycosis?
A: Onychomycosis can take a long time to treat, and some fungal nail infections can be resistant to antifungal medications. Treating a fungal nail infection can depend on identifying the appropriate medication that is effective against a particular subtype of infection.","Q: Can nail polish cause onychomycosis?
A: Nail polish is a sealant, so it can cause a buildup of moisture behind the nail, potentially creating an environment in which dermatophytes and other microorganisms can thrive. Avoiding nail polish is recommended while undergoing treatment for onychomycosis, as it could reduce the effectiveness of the antifungal medication. Furthermore, the applicator brush could be a vehicle for spreading infectious microorganisms.","Q: What are the main methods for removing a fungal nail?
A: Fungal nails can be removed surgically, using a tool to loosen the skin around the nail and remove the nail after a local anaesthetic is applied to the affected area to prevent pain. If the whole nail is removed, this is called avulsion. If part of the nail is removed, this is called debridement.","Alternatively, the nail can be removed chemically (non-surgically) by placing a dressing containing urea on the nail. This must be kept dry for 10 days after which the nail is softened to the point where it can be removed painlessly by the doctor.","Good to know: It is also possible to treat a fungal nail infection by removing the infected nail using a laser. Laser treatment for onychomycosis is not usually considered, other than in cases where antifungal medication has been ineffective."
,,,,,,,,,,What is open-angle glaucoma?
,,,,,,,,,,What is open-angle glaucoma?,"Open-angle glaucoma, or primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), is a condition in which pressure inside the eye causes damage to the delicate tissue and nerves on the inside of the eye. Over time, this affects the ability to see and can cause blindness.","Glaucoma is a common disorder of the eye and is the second most common cause of blindness worldwide. Open-angle glaucoma is one of several types of glaucoma. Open-angle glaucoma most commonly affects adults and becomes more common with age. The exact cause is not well understood, but several factors may combine to cause this condition. Most people have no symptoms until significant damage to the eye has occurred. At this point, people with glaucoma notice that they cannot see clearly, especially at the sides of their vision.","Open-angle glaucoma can be treated with medications, laser therapy or surgery. If left untreated, it eventually results in blindness.",Effects of open-angle glaucoma,"Open-angle glaucoma occurs when pressure inside the eye causes damage to the tissue and nerves inside the eye. This most commonly happens when pressure inside the eye increases, but can, in rare cases, occur with normal eye pressure. Pressure on the delicate tissues and nerves at the back of the eye causes damage and vision problems.",Symptoms of open-angle glaucoma,"Open-angle glaucoma does not produce any early symptoms, therefore many people are unaware that they are affected. Because the vision loss that results from glaucoma tends to affect peripheral vision first, the unaffected eye may be able to compensate for the vision loss in the affected eye.[1] This gives the impression that vision loss is not occuring.[2]","Over time, however, both eyes become affected. When approximately 40 percent of the optic nerve fibres are damaged, the vision loss becomes noticeable.[3] Vision in the central field is usually the last to be affected.","For this reason, screening for glaucoma is extremely important. People who are younger than 50 years of age should be screened by an optician once every five years, and people who are 50 years of age or older should be screened every two to three years.[2]",Risk factors for open-angle glaucoma,"The causes of open-angle glaucoma are not well understood, but it's likely that the increased pressure is caused by a combination of factors.","People over the age of 40 are more likely to develop glaucoma, and it becomes more common with age. People who are short-sighted, who have diabetes, who have African heritage and people who have a family member who has glaucoma are more likely to develop this condition.","While open-angle glaucoma does not have early symptoms, there are several risk factors that should be considered if glaucoma is suspected. These include:[4][2][3]",In the eye:,"
Histories of eye pain or eye redness
Halos, glowing or blurred border around objects
Previous ocular diseases, such as cataracts
Uveitis, inflammation of one of the layers of the eye
Previous eye surgery
Trauma to the head or eyes
Severe myopia

Vascular occlusion, blocked blood vessels in the body
Diabetes, type 1 or type 2

","Unlike narrow/closed-angle glaucoma, open-angle glaucoma does not cause a rapid rise in intraocular pressure (IOP). In narrow/closed-angle glaucoma, the trabecular meshwork at the rear of the eyeball closes, cutting off the drainage of the aqueous humor of the eye, and increasing IOP.",Diagnosis of open-angle glaucoma,"When glaucoma is present, the loss of vision and increased pressure inside the eye is often noticed during a routine checkup by  an optometrist. Diagnosis is usually confirmed by an ophthalmologist (eye doctor). The doctor will check for signs of nerve damage, vision loss and elevated pressure inside the eye. Other tests may be needed to exclude any possible underlying causes for the condition, including blood tests and a CT or MRI scan of the head.",Tests which may be done by an ophthalmologist on the eye itself include:[4][1][3],"
A slit lamp examination, in which a slit lamp, which is a combined light and magnifier, is used to examine the optic disc, the point at which the optic nerve leaves the eye. The object of this is to determine whether the disc has taken on a ‘cupped’ appearance.
Tonometry, which measures the pressure inside the eye. .
Field of vision testing, to determine the extent of vision loss.
Opthalmoscopy, which allows visualisation of the retina and optic disc.
Pachymetry, a test of corneal thickness. A thickening cornea may indicate glaucoma.
Gonioscopy, an examination of the trabecular meshwork, to assess the drainage of the aqueous humor. In open-angle glaucoma, this test typically does not find an obstruction. If an obstruction is present, the disorder is more likely to be closed-angle glaucoma.
","In addition, if it is suspected that open-angle glaucoma is the result of an underlying disorder, a complete blood count and a test of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate may be ordered. In cases where the person affected may have syphilis, a microhemagglutination treponema pallidum test may be ordered. If an underlying autoimmune disorder is suspected, a serum protein electrophoresis test may be ordered.",Treatment of open-angle glaucoma,"Treatment aims to decrease eye pressure with medication, laser therapy or surgery, in order to slow down or prevent worsening of the condition. Lowering intraocular pressure by 20 to 40 percent is the only treatment for open angle glaucoma.[3][5]",Eye drops are a common form of first-line treatment.,"The eye drops may contain beta-blockers, which reduce the aqueous output of the eye.[3][5] People who are already using systemic beta-blockers should ideally use eye drops containing beta-blockers from a different class. Other drugs that can be administered as eye drops include various prostaglandin analogs, which increase the outflow of aqueous humor.[3][5] Cholinesterase inhibitors, cholinesterase agonists and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may also be used.[5] Oral osmotic diuretics, such as glycerin and mannitol, may also be prescribed. These work by drawing fluid from the eye into the bloodstream. All of these can be used as first-line therapy, depending on what other medications the affected person is already using and their tolerance of side-effects.",Surgical intervention may be necessary in some cases. Options for surgery include:[2][3][5],"
Laser trabeculoplasty may be used as the first surgical option for patients who do not respond well to eye drops, or if eye drops have successfully reduced intraocular pressure without arresting optic nerve degeneration. In these procedures, a laser is used to improve drainage through the trabecular meshwork.
Surgical trabeculectomy is an option for patients whose open-angle glaucoma has not responded to eye drops or surgical trabeculectomy. In this procedure, a small channel is created between the front of the eye to the conjunctiva, allowing drainage to bypass the trabecular network.
Guarded filtration procedure and partial-thickness procedures are surgical procedures aimed at reducing intraocular pressure by improving drainage from the eye.
",Prevention of open-angle glaucoma,Screening people (testing patients without symptoms) who may be at risk of glaucoma can help to identify the condition early and prevent the complications of open-angle glaucoma.,"People younger than 50 years of age, who do not have a family history of open-angle glaucoma, should be screened once every five years. People who are older than 50, or younger but with a family history of glaucoma or other risk factors, should be screened once every two to three years. People with open-angle glaucoma will need to see an optometrist or opthalmologist at least once a year and possibly every several months, based on the progression of the disorder."

,,,,,,,,,,What is osteomalacia?,"Osteomalacia is the softening of bones in the body, leading to bone pain, bone tenderness, bending of the long bones and, in some cases, fractures.","Although bone appears to be hard, it is mostly made of collagen, the same material that flexible body parts like skin and tendons are made from. Bones become hard when a mineral, calcium phosphate, coats the collagen fibres in a process called mineralization. The more mineral in the bone, the harder the bone is.[1]","New bone is being formed in the body all the time. If the new collagen fibres are not properly coated with mineral, the bones become soft and may bend and break. This condition is known as osteomalacia.[2]","The most common cause of osteomalacia is a lack of vitamin D. In the United States, incidences of osteomalacia are rare, depending on location. People who live in cooler climates, particularly people with darker skin, are more at risk of developing osteomalacia.","In most cases, the prognosis is good, and the condition can be cured with straightforward treatment, often involving a course of vitamin and/or mineral supplements.","If you think that you might have a health condition, try using the Ada app to find out more about your symptoms.",Symptoms of osteomalacia,Soft bones are a typical sign of osteomalacia.

,,,,,,,,,,What is osteoporosis?
,,,,,,,,,,What is osteoporosis?,"Osteoporosis is a disorder of the skeleton in which the structure of the bones becomes porous. This can lead to the bones becoming weak, fragile and prone to painful fractures (breaks). It is a common bone disorder which can affect people of all ages. According to the National Institutes of Health, over 53 million people in the U.S. are affected by or are at high risk of osteoporosis developing due to having low bone mass.[1]","Bones are composed of protein, collagen and calcium. In healthy bones, these elements  combine to ensure that the bones have a strong structure. In people with osteoporosis, however, the density of the bones decreases. This causes the structure of the bones to weaken in a process which can worsen over time.",Changes to the bones which occur when a person is affected by osteoporosis include:[2],"
Bone density decreases (loss of calcification)
Bones become porous and spongy
Gaps develop in the bone structure
The sturdiness, typical of healthy bones, is lost
Fractures may occur independently, or as a result of very minor knocks or falls
",Symptoms,"Osteoporosis can remain undetected for many years, as it does not usually cause noticeable symptoms.","For most people, the first sign of osteoporosis is the diagnosis of a painful bone fracture resulting from a minor injury, such as a trivial slip-and-fall accident (an outcome which would not be expected to occur in someone with healthy bones).","People with osteoporosis are also prone to stress fractures, where a break occurs during a prolonged bout of a normal activity, such as walking, with no direct causal injury.[3]",Other signs that a person might be affected by osteoporosis include:[4],"
Pain in the spine and back; spinal fractures can cause long-term or chronic pain
Hyperkyphosis; a stooped posture, often characterised by a hunched back
Diminishing height
","When a fracture occurs, the break will be accompanied by intense pain at the site of the fracture, which radiates out and also affects the surrounding area.",Fractures most likely to occur due to osteoporosis affect specific areas of the body including:[5][6],"
Femoral neck (hip)
Tibiofemoral joint (knee)
Vertebrae (spine)
Lumbar region (the lower part of the spine, which joins the torso to the abdomen)
Thorax (chest)
",Causes,"Bone density increases until a person reaches their early 20s. Generally speaking, from a person's mid-30s, bone density begins to decrease.[7] Osteoporosis is caused when their bone density decreases at a rate which compromises the structure of their bones, which in turn become brittle (easily broken) and spongy.",Why does bone density decrease over time?,All bones perform a constant process of remodelling throughout a person’s lifetime. This involves the older bone matter dissolving (a process called resorption) at the same time as new bone cells produce new bone matter (osteoid).,"According to the International Osteoporosis Foundation, the principal reason that the bones weaken in people with osteoporosis is that the processes involved in remoddelling are occuring out of sync with one another. Old bone matter is dissolved at a significantly faster rate than new bone matter is produced, leading to gaps forming in the structure of the bones and an overall decrease in bone density.",Causes of osteoporosis in children,"Osteoporosis in children is uncommon, because bones generally grow stronger throughout one’s childhood and young adulthood, and the loss of bone density usually begins in adulthood.","Likewise, hormonal changes and health problems linked to osteoporosis, predominantly tend to affect older adults. However, it is possible to be affected by osteoporosis at any age, and there are certain conditions which increase a child’s likelihood of experiencing the condition.",Primary osteoporosis in children,Certain genetic conditions which impede the development of healthy bones can cause osteoporosis in children.

Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI)
Osteoporosis pseudoglioma syndrome
",These conditions cause osteoporosis in children by inhibiting the development of healthy bones.,"Idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis is a rare condition in which a previously healthy child or teenager develops osteoporosis.[8] If you are concerned that your child, or a child that you know, may be showing signs of osteoporosis, get a free symptom assessment with the Ada app.",Secondary osteoporosis in children,"It is much more common for children, who are affected by osteoporosis, to contract the condition as a result of other medical conditions and/or the medications associated with their management, such as the steroid medications often prescribed for children with asthma, eczema and arthritis.",Conditions which increase the likelihood of developing osteoporosis in children include:[8],"
Problems related to sex hormone production. Children who experience delayed puberty are at increased risk of experiencing problems with bone growth and maintenance.
Inflammatory conditions. Bone loss is linked to inflammatory diseases, and osteoporosis is therefore more likely to be experienced by those with conditions like childhood arthritis and Crohn's disease.
Gastrointestinal diseases. Conditions like coeliac disease impede the intake of nutrients, including those needed for the maintenance of healthy bones.
Eating disorders. Anorexia nervosa and bulimia impede nutritional intake and engender hormonal imbalance, which negatively impacts bone formation.
Conditions which compromise a child’s ability to be active. These include muscular dystrophy, spinal cord injury and cerebral palsy.
",Risk factors for developing osteoporosis,Factors which make it more likely that someone will develop osteoporosis include:,Having a small frame,"In general, people with a smaller frame have thinner, smaller bones, which can deteriorate to the point of being affected by osteoporosis more rapidly than larger, thicker bones.",Being female,"According to the National Osteoporosis Foundation, of the estimated 10 million Americans with osteoporosis, about eight million or 80% are women. The two principal reasons why osteoporosis disproportionately affects women are that they tend to have smaller, thinner frames than men, and that their hormone levels change during menopause, with a drop in estrogen levels causing bone loss.[9]",Being postmenopausal,"Osteoporosis is particularly prevalent amongst postmenopausal women. Approximately 200 million women worldwide are estimated to be affected.[10] After menopause, the levels of estrogen in the female body drop significantly, which affects the body’s ability to maintain healthy bones. For this reason, the removal of one’s ovaries causes a decrease in estrogen levels and is, therefore, also a risk factor for osteoporosis.",Having low testosterone levels,"In men, a decrease in hormone levels can precipitate the onset of osteoporosis, although not as commonly as in women. Conditions which cause one’s testosterone levels to diminish (such as hypogonadism), the long term use of steroid medications and regular alcohol consumption can all lower testosterone levels in men, thus increasing the likelihood of being affected by osteoporosis.[11]",Having a family history of osteoporosis,"An increasing body of research supports the hypothesis that osteoporosis is a hereditary condition. People, whose parents have been affected by osteoporosis, are considered to be particularly likely to develop the condition themselves.[12]",Taking steroid medication for over three months,Steroid medications significantly compromise the body’s ability to metabolise calcium and vitamin D. Both of these are essential for the maintenance of healthy bones.[13],Having calcium deficiency,The sturdiness and strength of one’s bones and teeth is dependent on the maintenance of their calcium content. Ninety-nine percent of the calcium within the body is stored in one’s bones and teeth.,"However, the body also relies on calcium for the effective functioning of certain processes, including muscle contraction, blood clotting and the maintenance of a normal heart rhythm. When the overall levels of calcium within the body are depleted, the calcium stored in the bones is extracted by the body for use in these processes. This depletion of calcium from the bones causes gaps in their structure which will eventually lead to osteoporosis.[14]",Having vitamin D deficiency,"Having adequate levels of vitamin D in one’s body is essential in order for the calcium, gained from one’s diet, to be absorbed effectively by the body. People with vitamin D deficiency are less likely to absorb the calcium they need in order to maintain healthy bones, which puts their bones at increased risk of osteoporosis.[15]",Having an eating disorder,"Conditions like bulimia and anorexia nervosa involve severely restricting one’s dietary intake in order to lose weight. This results in malnutrition and hormonal changes within the body, both of which precipitate a loss in bone density, increasing the likelihood of osteoporosis.[1]",Being physically inactive,"Being active, particularly in young adulthood, is linked to cultivating higher bone mass and stronger bones, which are better able to withstand the process of aging over time.[16]",Having hyperparathyroidism (parathyroid disease),"In healthy bodies, the parathyroid hormone is produced in appropriate quantities in order to regulate the distribution of calcium within the body. People with hyperparathyroidism produce excessive levels of the parathyroid hormone in their bodies. When this happens, calcium is removed from the bones at a faster rate than is healthy, causing osteoporosis.[17]",Having rheumatoid arthritis,"The chronic inflammation caused by rheumatoid arthritis results in bone loss. This is the primary cause of osteoporosis in people who are affected by rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA is a condition which also causes immobility and physical disability, thus reducing an individual’s ability to be physically active – a key means of preventing osteoporosis. RA is also widely associated with high-dose corticosteroid use. These medications compromise the body’s ability to metabolise calcium and vitamin D, essential for healthy bones; this can lead to the development of osteoporosis.[18]",Having gastrointestinal problems,"Problems, such as inflammatory bowel disease and coeliac disease, can heighten one’s risk of developing osteoporosis by compromising the body’s ability to absorb vitamins and minerals from one’s diet, including the intake of calcium and vitamin D which are necessary for the maintenance of healthy bones.[19] Feeling unwell? Get a free symptom assessment with the Ada app.",Using tobacco products regularly,"According to the World Health Organization, in those who use tobacco products, bone density decreases at a faster rate than the bone density ofthose who do not.[20] By the time a person who smokes regularly reaches old age, this decrease in bone density is significant enough to correlate to weaker bones, and a greater likelihood of fractures.",Drinking alcohol excessively,"People who drink alcohol regularly and/or excessively are at greater risk of developing osteoporosis than those who do not, particularly those who do so in their teenage years and young adulthood. Ethanol has been found to reduce bone formation, leading to weaker bones which become increasingly prone to fracturing in later life.[21]",Diagnosis,"The first sign of osteoporosis in most people is a fracture, which usually occurs as the result of a trivial slip-and-fall accident or in the course of one’s daily activities. People who visit the doctor with a fracture and/or are at high risk of osteoporosis are often recommended to undergo a bone density scan in order to diagnose and begin treating causes of osteoporosis.",DEXA bone density scan,"When a doctor examines a fracture, they will also order a bone density scan if they consider it likely that the fracture has occurred as a result of osteoporosis. Bone density scans measure one’s bone mineral density (BMD). The technology used in a bone density scan is called dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA or DEXA) or bone densitometry.[22]",Bone density scans are performed to:,"
Diagnose osteoporosis
Determine how advanced the condition is
Identify appropriate treatment options
",A bone density scan measures the amount of x-rays which are being absorbed by one’s bones and calculates a T score and a Z score.[23],"A T score* is a rating of one’s bone density in comparison to a healthy 30-year-old. The lower a person’s T-score, the lower their bone density. Healthy bones achieve a rating of -1 and above. If one’s rating is -2.5 and below, it is likely that one is affected by osteoporosis.",According to the World Health Organization (WHO):,"
A T-score of -1.0 or above means a person has normal bone density (for example, 0.9, 0 or -0.9)
A T-score between -1.0 and -2.5 usually means a person has low bone density or osteopenia (for examples, T-scores of -1.1, -1.6 or -2.4)
A T-score of -2.5 or below will usually result in a diagnosis of osteoporosis (for example, T-scores of -2.6, -3.3 and -3.9)
","A Z score reflects the number of standard deviations above or below what is a normal score for someone of one’s age, weight, ethnicity and sex. A Z-score above -2.0 is normal according to the International Society for Clinical Densitometry (ISCD).[24] The Z score is crucial to diagnosing osteoporosis, because an excessively high or low score can indicate the possible presence of other conditions which are precipitating one’s decreased bone density.",Assessing fractures for osteoporosis,The procedures which are used to examine bone fractures can often provide additional information which is helpful in diagnosing osteoporosis.,Procedures which are commonly used to examine fractures resulting from osteoporosis include:[25],"
CT scan of the spine. A version of computer tomography (CT) scanning called quantitative CT (QCT) can be used to measure bone density and determine the likelihood of spinal fractures. CT scanning is also used in the event of spinal fractures occurring in order to assess the damage and the alignment of the spine.
MRI scan of the spine. Magnetic resonance imaging can be used to assess fractures for the presence of additional diseases such as cancer – helping rule out a diagnosis which is not of osteoporosis – and to determine how long ago a given fracture occurred.
Bone X-ray. X-rays are often used to examine the fractures caused by osteoporosis, as they can be used anywhere on the body to provide accurate images of breakages in bones.
",Read more about having a CT Scan »,Treatment for osteoporosis,Treatment for osteoporosis focuses on four main areas:,"
Healing fractures
Ensuring that one’s nutritional intake contains appropriate quantities of vitamin D and calcium, often by incorporating supplements into one’s diet
Taking medication to strengthen one’s bones
Preventing future falls and fractures
",Healing fractures,"Osteoporosis does not cause broken bones to heal any more slowly than they otherwise would. Broken bones take between six and eight weeks to heal on average, but some fractures may require additional intervention.[26]",Fractures which commonly occur as a result of osteoporosis and which may require additional intervention include:,"
Hip fractures; a hip replacement is often needed
Wrist fracture; an operation is often needed
Spinal fracture; surgery and/or physiotherapy may be needed to correct the alignment of the spine
",Vitamin supplements,"Lacking sufficient levels of calcium and vitamin D is a primary risk factor for developing osteoporosis. The body cannot make calcium on its own, and the production of sufficient levels of vitamin D (which the body needs in order to absorb calcium from food) requires exposure to plenty of sun. It is vital that one’s diet contains sufficient sources of both nutrients. People with osteoporosis are often advised to take supplements of both vitamin D and calcium in order to replenish the body’s levels of these substances and prevent further bone damage.","One’s doctor will advise on the appropriate brands and strengths of supplements to take, depending on factors including one’s age, weight, gender and the severity of one’s condition.",Medication for osteoporosis,"There are many different types and brands of medication for osteoporosis. The kind of medication, which is recommended for an individual, will be selected based on factors including:[27]","
Age
Gender
Hormonal levels
Ability to adhere to a given dosing schedule
Preference
Convenience
Cost
",Bisphosphonates (oral medications),"The most commonly prescribed type of medications for osteoporosis are bisphosphonates. These are oral medications which work to maintain one’s bone density and delay the process of the bones breaking down. However, bisphosphonates may not be suitable in all cases of osteoporosis, as they can carry side effects of severe stomach upsets and heartburn (which can be lessened in most cases by taking the medication according to precise guidelines).",Injected medications,People who cannot tolerate oral bisphosphonates due to digestive complications and/or the extent to which their health is compromised by osteoporosis and other possible coexisting conditions may be prescribed injected medications.,Commonly prescribed injected medications include:[28][29],"
Denosumab (Prolia / Xgeva). This is a new medication suitable for both genders, which is unrelated to bisphosphonates and may be a viable alternative for people who are intolerant to them. It is also used in the treatment of bone cancer.
Teriparatide (Forteo). This medication has the potential to rebuild bone and is most often prescribed for men and postmenopausal women with very low bone density.
Abaloparatide (Tymlos). This medication can help new bone structure to form and redress the damage related to fractures from osteoporosis. It is the first medication to promote the formation of new bone structure, which is similar to that of pre-existing bone.
","Both Teriparatide and Abaloparatide are recommended for a maximum of two years of use, during which time one receives daily injections.[30] Injected medications are most likely to be prescribed to treat:","
People with extremely low bone density
Children with osteoporosis
People with multiple fractures
Osteoporosis caused by steroid medication
",Hormone replacement therapy (HRT),"Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) can slow the process of bone remodelling and help increase a woman’s bone mineral density, and can be prescribed for both early and late menopausal women to combat the negative effects of the decrease in estrogen levels that accompany the menopause. It involves regular supplements of estrogens and also progestins in some cases.[31]","HRT is not usually recommended as a long-term or first-line treatment for osteoporosis, because it is associated with severe side effects and health complications:[31]","
Cardiovascular complications (problems relating to the heart including unstable angina or heart attacks, strokes and pulmonary embolism)
Breast cancer
Endometrial cancer
Ovarian cancer
Breast tenderness
Vaginal bleeding
","Women are usually only prescribed HRT for osteoporosis if all other possible treatments are unsuitable for an individual. When HRT is prescribed for osteoporosis, it should be at the lowest possible dose and for the shortest possible duration.",Preventing falls and fractures,Recent research on osteoporosis and fractures in the elderly suggests that preventing falls is just as important to managing osteoporosis as monitoring and improving one’s bone mineral density.[32],"Doctors are therefore advised to assess people with osteoporosis in order to ascertain the likelihood of falls which could result in fractures. They will use this information to devise preventative measures, suggesting changes to a person’s diet, daily routine and medications as necessary to avert the possibility of future falls.",Factors which one’s doctor may consider in assessing one’s risk of falling and preventative measures include:[32],"
One’s history of falling, including the total number of falls in the previous 12 months
Location of falls
Ability to get up independently after falling
Eyesight
Cognitive function
Other relevant medical conditions
Walking and movement
Muscle strength and function
Medications which may make dizziness, falling or loss of balance more likely
",Changes to one’s home environment and routine which may help prevent falls include:,"
Taking regular exercise; even in very elderly people, increased safe physical activity has been shown to reduce the likelihood of falls significantly, in part by improving strength and balance control
Removing trip hazards like trailing wires
Having regular hearing and eyesight tests
Placing non-stick mats on areas which are likely to become slippery, such as the kitchen floor and bathroom
Eating a healthy diet
",Pain management,"Bone fractures resulting from osteoporosis may be more painful than regular fractures due to the splintering of the bone that results from their weakened structure. People with osteoporosis will therefore be prescribed appropriate pain medication in order to manage the pain that results from both specific fractures, and from the generalised pain which often occurs in the spinal area.",Painkilling medications prescribed and/or recommended in the management of osteoporosis may include:,"
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS)
Prescription anti-inflammatory medications
Nerve blocks
Opiate painkillers
",Ensuring that a person with osteoporosis is able to enact their day-to-day regime as comfortably as possible may require further medical interventions.,These may include:[33],"
Physiotherapy
Educational measures (to equip an individual to understand their needs and make the best choices to prevent pain)
Surgical interventions (such as nerve removal)
",Prevention of osteoporosis,"Osteoporosis is, in part, a hereditary condition, meaning one is particularly susceptible if one’s parents have been affected by osteoporosis. It is nevertheless possible to take measures to help prevent osteoporosis. Adapting one’s diet and exercise regimes, avoiding excessive consumption of alcohol, stopping the use of tobacco products and getting sufficient sunlight are fundamental factors in safeguarding one’s bones against osteoporosis.","People who are sufficiently active and eat appropriately to prevent osteoporosis in childhood and young adulthood, build a stronger bone structure than those who do not, and are significantly less at risk of being affected by osteoporosis in later life.[34]",Diet,"Both calcium and vitamin D are required for healthy bone development and remodelling. Eating a balanced diet helps provide the body with essential nutrition, which can aid the prevention of a variety of conditions, including osteoporosis.","The body cannot make its own stores of calcium, making it essential that one’s diet includes sufficient sources of calcium to provide one with one’s required daily intake (approximately 700 mg per day for adults).",Sources of calcium include:[35],"
Dairy produce such as milk and cheese
Soya beans and certain soya products such as soy milk (which are often fortified with calcium)
Leafy green vegetables such as kale, broccoli and cabbage
Tofu
Fish with edible bones such as sardines
Baked goods made with fortified flour
","The body can synthesise vitamin D using its stores of cholesterol when it has access to UVB radiation (sunlight). Some foodstuffs also contain vitamin D, and many products (such as soy milk and orange juice) are fortified with it.",Sources of vitamin D include:,"
Oily fish such as trout, salmon, herring, sardines, pilchards, kippers, tuna
Cod liver oil (this contains large amounts of vitamin D and should not be used in conjunction with other supplements)
Fortified dairy products
Fortified soy products
Raw milk
Meat
Egg yolk
","Often, it is not possible – particularly for people living far from the equator – to ensure that one’s intake of vitamin D is sufficient by relying on sunlight and nutritional sources alone.","For this reason, in order to prevent conditions like osteoporosis, it is advisable to take a vitamin D supplement. Adults are recommended to consume a supplement of vitamin D. One should seek advice from a pharmacist or healthcare provider when choosing a supplement to ensure that it and the dosage are appropriate for one’s age and body-type, and that its contents do not overlap with any other supplements or medication one may be using.",Read more about Vitamin D Deficiency »,Exercise,"Exercise is an essential means of preventing bone loss, which occurs naturally as one ages and can lead to osteoporosis. At least 30 minutes per day of physical exercise are recommended for all adults. Intense daily activity is proven more effective than infrequent, longer exercise sessions.[36]","People with health conditions such as cardiovascular problems should consult their doctor before devising an exercise regime, in order to make sure that the physical activities they choose are appropriate for their capabilities.",Activities which are particularly helpful in the prevention of osteoporosis include:[37],"
Weight-bearing exercise. The best activities for building bone strength are those which compel one to work against gravity, such as weight training, hiking and jogging.
Regular exercise. Activities like walking fast and cycling constitute moderate-intensity exercise and are easy to incorporate into one’s weekly routine.
Muscle-strengthening exercise. Activities which build one’s stamina and strengthen one’s muscles such as yoga, skipping and tai-chi can help increase one’s poise and prevent falls in later life.
Stationary exercise. Many hip, leg and spine exercises which are helpful in strengthening the areas of the body most prone to fractures from osteoporosis can be carried out at home with the use of a straight-backed chair, and are easily incorporated into one’s routine.
",Osteoporosis FAQs,"Q: How does one’s milk intake in childhood influence one’s risk of developing osteoporosis later on?
A: Milk is a source of calcium, which is essential for the development and growth of healthy bones. The stronger one’s bones develop during their formative years (childhood and adolescence), the more likely they are to age slowly and stably, reducing one’s chances of developing osteoporosis. Daily milk intake in childhood and adolescence has been found to increase bone mass and density in adulthood more effectively than taking calcium supplements for the same purpose, once the skeleton is fully grown. Milk consumption in childhood is therefore advised in order to prevent rapid bone loss and reduce the risk of osteoporotic fracture in adulthood.[38]","Q: What is the difference between osteoporosis and osteopenia?
A: Both osteoporosis and osteopenia are diseases with the primary characteristic of a decrease in bone density and the conditions are  caused by the same factors.","Osteopenia involves a lesser degree of damage to the bones than osteoporosis. The distinction between whether a person is affected by osteoporosis or osteopenia is most accurately determined by their bone density score. A score of less than -1 and greater than -2.5 indicates that a person is affected by osteopenia rather than osteoporosis. Osteopenia is a less severe condition involving low bone density which can progress to osteoporosis if left untreated. It is therefore important to seek medical attention if one is at risk of osteoporosis, even if one has not experienced a fracture, in order to identify and begin to treat possible cases of osteopenia. Treatment for both conditions should be focussed on treating the underlying secondary cause(s) where possible.","Q: Is osteoarthritis related to osteoporosis?
A: Osteoarthritis and osteoporosis both affect the bones, but osteoarthritis is a condition which specifically affects the joints, rather than the bones as a whole. In osteoarthritis, the cartilage at the ends of the bones, which connect at one’s joints, wear away, causing the swelling characteristic of arthritis. This causes one’s bones to thicken and harden at the ends, developing new structures called spurs around one’s joints which force the bones out of their normal position.","The primary risk factors of osteoarthritis are being over 40, being female, being overweight and being genetically predisposed to conditions which affect one’s joints. Both osteoporosis and osteoarthritis can cause back pain and height loss.[39] If you think you may be affected by either of these conditions, get a free symptom assessment with the Ada app."

,,,,,,,,,,What is otitis externa?,"Otitis externa is an infection of the outer ear canal, and is more commonly known as swimmer's ear. Water that remains in the ear after swimming can make it easier for bacteria or fungus to grow. The symptoms may range from itching to pain and swelling of the ear canal. Treatment involves pain relief and ear drops to treat the ear infection. It is also helpful to keep the ear dry. Most people recover well with no complications, though people with diabetes or a weakened immune system are at risk of developing a severe infection.",Risks,"Outer ear infections are often caused by bacteria or fungi in the outer ear canal. This canal runs between the ear drum and the visible ear. It commonly occurs when the ear canal is wet, causing a moist, warm environment for bacteria and fungi to grow. People who do water sports or who go swimming regularly may be more likely to develop this condition. Putting in foreign objects (including cotton ear swabs) might cause damage to the skin of the ear canal, and make it easier for bacteria and fungi to grow.",Symptoms,"Typical symptoms of an outer ear infection include itching in the ear, pain in the ear, difficulty hearing and a discharge from the ear. Sometimes the whole outer ear may become red and swollen. In severe cases, people may develop headaches and fever.",Diagnosis,The diagnosis is made by a physician based on the symptoms and physical examination. This often involves using a small torch (an otoscope) to examine the ear canal and ear drum. It may be necessary to test the discharge from the ear for the specific cause of the infection.,Treatment,"Treatment may involve gentle cleaning of the ear, pain relief and antibiotic therapy. Pain-relieving medications such as ibuprofen or paracetamol are useful to help with pain. A doctor may prescribe antibiotics or anti-fungal medications to treat the infect, and these are most commonly an ointment or drops which are put into the ear. Rarely, oral antibiotics might be needed. Swimming, flying and the use of earplugs should be avoided in order to avoid further irritation of the air canal.",Prevention,"Prevention measures include keeping one's ear dry when swimming, by using soft ear plugs or by keeping the head out of the water, and not inserting things into the ear canal.",Other names for otitis externa,"

,,,,,,,,,,What is ovarian cancer?
,,,,,,,,,,What is ovarian cancer?,"Ovarian cancer, also known as cancer of the ovaries, is a type of cancer that affects females. It is the name for a number of cancers that can develop in the ovaries; the organs that store eggs and are connected to the womb.[1][2][3][4]","While it is not the most common type of cancer in women, ovarian cancer has lower survival rates than other cancers of the female reproductive system. This may be because symptoms of ovarian cancer are not always obvious, leading to late diagnosis. The prognosis (outlook) tends to be better, the earlier the cancer is detected.[1][4][5]","This type of cancer mostly affects women over the age of 50, and the average age at diagnosis is 63.[2][3] Every year, more than 20 000 women in the United States are diagnosed with ovarian cancer; in Europe this number is closer to 65 000.[1][4]","Treatment depends on the type of ovarian cancer and stage of diagnosis, but typically involves a combination of surgery and chemotherapy.[1][6][7] Recovery rates tend to be better in cases where the cancer is diagnosed early, and where the woman is younger than 40.[1][5]",Types of ovarian cancer,There are several different types of ovarian cancer. These include:[1][8][9],Epithelial ovarian tumors,"These comprise the vast majority, about 90 percent of malignant ovarian cancers. Epithelial ovarian tumors develop in the epithelium, which is the thin layer of tissue covering the ovaries. These most often occur in women over the age of 50. There are several subtypes of epithelial tumors.","Not all epithelial tumors are cancerous (called malignant, or carcinomas). Many epithelial tumors are benign, having less of a tendency to spread.","Some epithelial tumors are called borderline ovarian tumors, or tumors of low malignant potential (LMP tumors); these fall between benign and malignant. They tend to affect younger women and have a better prognosis (outlook).",Germ cell tumors,"Cancerous germ cell tumors account for only a small percentage of malignant ovarian cancers.[10] They are most common in women under 35 and tend to have a good prognosis. The tumors, of which there are six different types, develop from the cells that form eggs. They are typically detected as a painful abdominal mass that gets bigger quickly.",Stromal tumors,"Cancerous stromal tumors also account for just a small percentage of ovarian cancers. Stromal tumors form in the connective tissue cells, which keep the ovary intact and produce female hormones. Most cases are diagnosed early and tend to have a good prognosis.","Stromal tumors, of which there are several different types, can produce sex hormones, causing symptoms that include:","
Unexplained vaginal bleeding

","People over the age of 50 and those who have a strong family history of ovarian (or breast) cancer, a BRCA mutation or Lynch syndrome may be encouraged to undergo screening for ovarian cancer.[19][24]",Diagnosis of ovarian cancer,"As the first step, a doctor will need to confirm that the symptoms are not being caused by any other conditions, including uterine fibroids, endometriosis and gastrointestinal disorders.[1]","A doctor will typically take the person’s medical history and perform a physical examination, including a pelvic examination. If they suspect that ovarian cancer may be present, they will order an ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) scan or a magnetic resonance imaging scan (MRI) to investigate.[12][9]","The doctor will also order blood tests to check, among other things, the levels of a substance called cancer antigen (CA) 125. This is a tumor marker that is often found at elevated levels in people with ovarian cancer. However, this test is not totally reliable; certain other conditions, such as endometriosis, can cause the levels to be high, and in some cases of ovarian cancer, the levels are not elevated.[12][9]","If the combined tests suggest that ovarian cancer may be present, it will usually be necessary to undergo surgery to confirm the diagnosis. In a small number of cases, a non-surgical biopsy, where the doctor takes a sample of tissue or fluid with a needle, may be performed.[12][9]","A pap test, which is used to screen for cervical cancer, usually cannot detect ovarian cancer.",Surgery,"The aim of surgery is to confirm the diagnosis, define the extent of disease and remove all visible tumor. If ovarian cancer is suspected, the doctor may recommend an exploratory laparotomy or sometimes an exploratory laparoscopy, depending on the age of the person and size of the identified mass, among other factors.[12][9]","For the highest probability of success, a gynecologic oncologist, i.e. a medical professional specializing in the management of cancers of the female reproductive system, should be asked to perform the surgery.[12][9]",Exploratory laparotomy,"The surgeon will typically make a long incision in the abdomen in order to check the area for any signs of cancer. Where possible, they may take samples of tissue and fluid, which will be closely examined by a specialist while the person is in the operating room. If cancer is strongly suspected or confirmed, the surgeon will remove as much of the cancerous tissue as they can during the same procedure. Called debulking, this may involve removing the uterus, fallopian tubes and one or both ovaries, as well as nearby tissue and organs, if the cancer has spread.[12][9]","If a person is not a good candidate for surgery to remove the bulk of the tumor tissue, a doctor may recommend that they undergo a course of initial chemotherapy to reduce the tumor size, followed by surgery to remove tumor tissue, and further chemotherapy.[25]",Exploratory laparoscopy,"In some cases, for instance when the person is young and the likelihood of cancer small or where a laparotomy cannot be performed, this less-invasive type of surgery may be recommended. The surgeon will typically make a small incision in the abdomen to insert a laparoscope – a flexible tube with a camera on the end – and use this to check for cancer. Tissue and fluid samples can also be taken and the ovaries removed, if necessary, during the procedure.[12][9][26]","Read more about laparoscopy, also known as keyhole surgery »",Staging,"Based on the findings of the exploratory procedure, the ovarian cancer will be classified as one of four stages, depending on how advanced it is:[1][27]","Stage I ovarian cancer: The cancer is at an early stage. Tumors are found in one or both ovaries and, depending on the advancement of the condition, the ovary or ovaries may have ruptured, there may be tumors on the surface of the ovaries, or the cancer cells may have started spreading within the pelvic area.","Stage II ovarian cancer: The cancer is still at an early stage, but has spread to other organs in the pelvis, such as the uterus or fallopian tubes.

While it may extend to the capsule of the liver and spleen, it has not spread beyond the abdomen and abdominal lymph nodes.","Stage IV ovarian cancer: The cancer is at a very advanced stage, having spread into other areas such as the liver or lungs.","Staging the cancer helps doctors recommend the most appropriate treatment programme. Generally speaking, the earlier the stage of diagnosis, the higher the likelihood of recovery.",Ovarian cysts,"Sometimes, a medical check-up will reveal an ovarian cyst – a fluid-filled sac either inside or on the ovary. Ovarian cysts are common in females of all age groups, and are usually harmless (benign). They may cause pain and pressure in the pelvic area, but many people experience no symptoms at all. The cysts do not usually cause irregular periods or vaginal bleeding.[9][28]","The majority of ovarian cysts typically develop during ovulation (the process where an egg is released from the ovary), and disappear on their own within a month or two, without any treatment.[9][28]
However, a very small number of ovarian cysts may be cancerous. If a cyst is particularly large, does not go away, has developed in a pre-pubescent or postmenopausal person, or if there is any other cause for concern, a doctor may recommend further scans, blood tests and sometimes surgery to investigate.[9][28]",Ovarian cancer treatment,"Following surgery, during which as much of the cancer as possible will have been removed, further treatment may be recommended. The treatment approach will depend on the stage and type of the ovarian cancer, but, except in the very early stages, will typically involve chemotherapy.[1][29]","In some cases of stage III or stage IV ovarian cancer, doctors may recommend a course of chemotherapy prior to surgery. This is called neoadjuvant chemotherapy.[29]",Chemotherapy for ovarian cancer,"Chemotherapy can improve the likelihood of recovery from ovarian cancer. It typically involves the administering of drugs called paclitaxel and carboplatin through the veins, a procedure that is done approximately once every three weeks for up to six cycles. Sometimes, other drugs may be used. The treatment may also be administered directly into the abdominal cavity; this is called intraperitoneal chemotherapy.[1][3]",The general aims of chemotherapy treatment are to destroy any remaining tumor tissue and increase the likelihood of recovery.[3],"Chemotherapy can sometimes have unpleasant side-effects, such as hair loss, nausea and vomiting, fatigue and pain. A doctor will be able to advise on how best to manage the side-effects, should they occur.[3][29] For more information, see this resource on chemotherapy side-effects.",Radiation therapy,"Also known as radiotherapy, this type of treatment uses X-rays to destroy cancer cells. In the treatment of ovarian cancer, radiation therapy is typically only used in cases where a person does not respond to chemotherapy, or where the cancer is very advanced, and it is no longer possible to administer chemotherapy.[29]",Alternative treatments,"While a number of other treatments for ovarian cancer are being explored, further research is needed before they can be recommended.[1] If a person is interested in alternatives to chemotherapy, it is advisable to consult with their healthcare team.","In some cases, it may be possible to participate in a clinical drug trial.

A: While many internet sources suggest that certain foods may help to prevent ovarian cancer, there is no specific ovarian cancer prevention diet. A healthy, balanced diet that includes significant quantities of vegetables, fruits and whole grains is recommended by medical professionals. In addition, it is thought that avoiding processed meats and limiting one’s intake of red meat may be beneficial. Alcohol consumption should also be limited.[22][12]","Q: Will a cervical screening test detect ovarian cancer?
A: No, except in a small number of very advanced cases, where a doctor might see the effects of ovarian cancer while performing the cervical examination.[23] According to Ovarian Cancer Action UK, one in four women mistakenly believe that ovarian cancer can be detected by cervical screening, also known as a cervical smear test or Pap test; a procedure which detects abnormal, potentially precancerous cells in the cervix, the part connecting the womb to the vagina. Detecting, and, if necessary, removing these cells and affected adjacent cervical tissue can reduce a person’s risk of developing cervical cancer, but the procedure does not collect information about the existence of cancerous or precancerous cells in areas other than the cervix.

Not all mutations can be detected with current technology. Furthermore, many people with genetic mutations will not develop ovarian cancer, while other people without genetic mutations might.[9]","Nevertheless, the reliability of testing methods for ovarian cancer is continually being improved with new research, and it is recommended that all females at high risk of ovarian cancer undergo screening to maximize the likelihood of early detection and effective treatment.",Ovarian cancer screening tests,Ovarian cancer screening tests typically involve a blood test and/or ultrasound scan of the pelvic area. A combination of both is considered more reliable in the diagnosis of ovarian cancer than when either procedure is performed on its own.[11],CA-125 blood test,"This test measures the level of a protein called cancer antigen (CA) 125 in the blood. In women who have an elevated risk of ovarian cancer, or show possible signs of ovarian cancer, tests like the CA-125 blood test may provide useful insights. In many, but not all women with ovarian cancer, CA-125 levels are higher than normal. This is typically understood to mean more than 35 U/mL.[12]","However, high levels of CA-125 are not always a sign of ovarian cancer, and the results of a CA-125 blood test should always be interpreted very cautiously.

However, similar to CA-125, high levels of HE-4 are found in a number of other conditions.[10]",The ROCA test,"In some countries, including the US, regular blood tests for CA-125 are sometimes encouraged for a large number of women by private healthcare providers. One example of these tests is called the Risk of Ovarian Cancer Algorithm, or ROCA for short. However, national health authorities have cautioned against routine use of ROCA for ovarian cancer screening in women without any symptoms, because of the risk of getting a false positive result and an unreliable diagnosis.[14]",Pelvic ultrasound,"This imaging test uses sound waves to generate a picture of the womb, ovaries, fallopian tubes and other organs in the pelvis. Also known as a transvaginal ultrasound, it involves the use of an ultrasound device (wand) in the vagina and also over the abdomen (belly).[8][10][15]","An ultrasound scanner can detect masses, or tumors, in the pelvis, but cannot reliably differentiate between those that are caused by cancer and those that are related to other conditions, such as ovarian cysts. The majority of masses found during ovarian cancer screening are not cancerous.[8][13][15] Care must be taken when interpreting results to avoid unnecessary surgery.[11]","The only way to be certain that a person has ovarian cancer is by performing surgery, during which the ovaries will typically be removed and then tested. Because this is a major procedure with significant consequences for women wanting to have children, doctors try to avoid surgery unless it seems very likely that a person has ovarian cancer.",Ovarian cancer screening FAQs,"Q: Can a Pap smear detect ovarian cancer?

A: In many cases, it is possible to carry out fertility-sparing initiatives, such as harvesting a woman’s eggs and freezing them before surgery to remove the ovaries is carried out. If only one ovary and fallopian tube need to be removed, a procedure called unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment may be possible. This means that the egg and sperm will be joined in a laboratory, and subsequently inserted into the womb, after which the pregnancy progresses as normal. For women who undergo a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, in which both ovaries and fallopian tubes are removed, or for whom a total hysterectomy is necessary, a natural pregnancy will not be possible thereafter.

It has a range of biological and cognitive functions and is believed to play a role in pregnancy, childbirth, sexual activity, maternal bonding, social bonding and stress. Its various prosocial functions have led to oxytocin being dubbed the love or cuddle hormone.[2]","Oxytocin is produced naturally by the body, usually upon physical contact with others. Supplements of the hormone are available, though they may lead to side-effects.",How is oxytocin produced and controlled?,"Oxytocin is produced by the hypothalamus portion of the brain and is controlled by a positive feedback mechanism. The production of oxytocin is caused by a trigger or action which then stimulates further production. For example, contractions during childbirth trigger oxytocin production, which in turn triggers more contractions, which again triggers further production of oxytocin. This process is usually self-limiting, meaning it halts when the trigger or action ceases.[3]","If you think that you or a loved one may be experincning orpblems related to hormone production, you can get a free symotom assessment at any time by downloading the Ada app.",What is the function of oxytocin?,"The functions of oxytocin are thought to be multifaceted, playing a role in physical, emotional and behavioral processes of the body.",Biological function,Oxytocin helps to regulate two of the reproductive functions of the female body: childbirth and breastfeeding.,"Oxytocin plays a role in cervical dilation before birth and helps stimulate contractions during labor. Production of the hormone is triggered by the widening of the cervix; oxytocin then stimulates the uterine muscles to contract and encourages the production of prostaglandins, which further stimulates contractions.[4]","During breastfeeding, oxytocin helps with the movement of milk from the mammary glands,  where it is produced, to a collecting chamber, from where it can be accessed by an infant.","In men, oxytocin is thought to play a role in the movement of sperm and in the production of the hormone testosterone. Research also suggests that oxytocin plays a role in male erection and in the intensity of orgasms for both sexes. Oxytocin is known to be released during sex, childbirth and lactation, playing an important role in physical reproductive functions.",Emotional and behavioral functions,"Oxytocin was first identified for the function it performs during childbirth and breastfeeding, but clinical research indicates that it also has an effect on emotions, bonding and social relationships.[5]","As well as stimulating contractions during childbirth, oxytocin is also thought to be important in the formation of a mutual bond between mother and child. Interactions between mother and child are believed to lead to the production of the hormone, which then sets off the positive feedback loop for further production, creating the unique relationship between a mother and her newborn child, known as the maternal bond.[6] This same process may also be a factor in the creation of a paternal bond.",Read more about Pregnancy »,"Oxytocin may also help to regulate the female response to giving birth, reducing feelings or memories of stress or physical trauma and promoting feelings of positivity and happiness.[7] Immediately after giving birth, there is an oxytocin peak which is connected to these feelings, as well as those of bonding towards the baby.","Research suggests that oxytocin also facilitates the formation of social bonds - in friendships, families, organizations and particularly between sexual partners. The hormone is released during physical contact, including during sex, as well as hugging or holding hands, working to boost the attraction between partners.[8] Oxytocin, therefore, is believed to be a key factor behind romantic attachment and monogamous relationships. Higher levels of oxytocin have also been observed to be present in the early stages of a romantic relationship.[9]","It has also been suggested that oxytocin acts to promote trust between individuals, as well as to reduce fear, social anxiety and boost positivity and self-esteem.[10][10]","Low oxytocin levels have been linked to autism and autism spectrum disorders, conditions in which decreased social interactions are often seen.[11] This has led to the idea that oxytocin could be effective in treating acute shyness and severe social anxiety.

,,,,,,,,,,What is pediatric acute otitis media?,"Acute otitis media is an infection of the middle ear. When children have this condition, it is known as pediatric (or childhood) otitis media. This is a very common childhood condition, especially in children younger than 5 years of age. The middle ear is the part of the ear inside the ear drum, and helps conduct sound through the ear. An infection can be caused by viruses or bacteria. Typical signs may include pain of the ear, fever, hearing difficulty and difficulty sleeping. Infants may cry more than usual or pull on their ear. Treatment is pain relief and sometimes requires antibiotics. Most children do not develop any complications and recover well from a middle ear infection.",Risks,"Acute otitis media is caused by viruses (colds, the flu, ect) or bacteria. This is why a middle ear infection might begin following an episode of a cold or the flu. Children who have parents who smoke may be more likely to suffer middle ear infections. Other conditions that cause swelling in the nose (such as allergies or swelling of the tonsils) may also make middle ear infections more likely, because this swelling blocks off a tube that runs between the nose and middle ear. Blockage of this tube can make it easier for viruses or bacteria to infect the middle ear. This tube is shorter in children, and tends to get blocked more readily than in adults.",Symptoms,"Typical symptoms of this conditions are pain of the ear and difficulty hearing. Small children may tug on the affected ear, have difficulty sleeping and cry more than usual. Some children may also develop fever, headaches and loss of appetite. Severe cases may cause a burst ear drum and pus may run from the ear.",Diagnosis,The diagnosis is usually made by a doctor based on the symptoms and physical examination. An otoscope may be used – a small tool used to look at the ear drum.,Treatment,"Pain relief may be achieved by warm compresses or pain medication (such as ibuprofen and paracetamol). Antibiotics are often not needed to treat middle ear infections, but may be needed for children with complicated ear infections or other medical issues. If a child repeatedly experiences middle ear infections, a doctor may recommend a procedure to drain fluid from the middle ear (a myringotomy).",Prevention,Taking care to prevent the spread of colds or the flu in the home and community can help prevent some cases of otitis media. Children should not be exposed to second hand cigarette smoke. There are vaccinations against some viruses and bacteria that can cause acute otitis media. Keeping to the recommended vaccination schedule may help to prevent middle ear infections.,Other names for pediatric acute otitis media,"

,,,,,,,,,,What is pericardial effusion?
,,,,,,,,,,What is pericardial effusion?,"Pericardial effusion is a buildup of fluid around the heart muscle. The heart is surrounded by a protective membrane called the pericardium, which is a sac comprised of two layers of tissue with lubricating fluid in between. Pericardial effusion occurs when the amount of fluid between the two pericardium (sac) layers is abnormally high.[1][2][3]","Good to know: Effusion is the medical term for a buildup of fluid. Effusions can occur in other parts of the body besides the heart membrane. For example, fluid can build up around the lungs – this is called pleural effusion.","Often, pericardial effusion is mild, progresses slowly, does not cause any signs or symptoms, and is discovered incidentally as part of a routine medical check-up. However, if the pericardial effusion develops or progresses rapidly, the pressure it exerts may compromise the functioning of the heart and lead to serious complications – particularly where there is a large amount of fluid.",Signs of pericardial effusion may include:,"
Chest pain
Rapid heartbeat
Feeling lightheaded
Fainting
",See the symptoms section below for more.[1][2][3],"Pericardial effusion can be caused by almost any disease or health condition that affects the pericardium, including pericarditis (inflammation of the pericardium), infections and systemic disorders, for example, hypothyroidism, systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, as well as kidney failure and cancer.[1][4]","While pericardial effusion can affect people of all ages, the incidence seems to be higher in those over 50.[5] Generally speaking, in younger people the heart is better able to compensate for a progressing effusion.[2]","The prognosis for pericardial effusion depends on the size of the effusion and the underlying cause. Small effusions are quite common and may simply require monitoring by a doctor, often resolving on their own with supportive treatment.[1] Where necessary, treatment for pericardial effusion involves addressing the cause, for example by prescribing antibiotics for a bacterial infection, steroids and other medications for rheumatoid arthritis, or anti-inflammatory medications for pericarditis.[1][6] Large effusions typically indicate a more serious health condition and may require drainage (pericardiocentesis).[1][7] Recovery may take several weeks or months, depending on the severity and cause of the pericardial effusion.[6]","A possible complication of pericardial effusion is cardiac tamponade, which is a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention.[1]",Signs and symptoms of pericardial effusion,"Signs and symptoms depend on the size of the heart effusion and the rate at which it develops. People with small pericardial effusions that have developed slowly may not experience any specific symptoms at all.[1] However, there may be symptoms related to the underlying cause, for example, fever from pericarditis.","Where present, symptoms of pericardial effusion may include:[1][8]","
Feeling light-headed or fainting

",Worried you may have pericardial effusion? Check your symptoms with Ada.,Pericardial effusion causes,A wide range of health conditions can cause pericardial effusion. Possible causes include the following:[1][9],"
Pericarditis (acute or chronic)
Viral infection (e.g. HIV)
Bacterial, fungal or parasitic infection, including tuberculosis
Heart attack
Heart surgery
Chest trauma
Kidney failure or injury
Severe untreated hypothyroidism
Whipple’s disease
Familial Mediterranean fever
Cancer
Radiation (e.g. radiotherapy)
Sarcoidosis (an inflammatory condition that can affect many organs)
Autoimmune conditions (e.g. systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis
Certain medications (e.g. blood pressure and blood clotting medications)
",In many cases of pericardial effusion the cause of the fluid buildup is unknown. This is called idiopathic pericardial effusion.,Diagnosis of pericardial effusion,"The first step in diagnosing pericardial effusion will be for a doctor to take the affected person’s medical history and perform a physical examination. The doctor will typically measure the individual’s blood pressure, and pulse, and listen to the heart through a stethoscope for audible signs of fluid buildup.[1][9]","Where the pericardial effusion has developed slowly, symptoms may be absent or minimal. A doctor will usually look for the following:","
Accelerated pulse
Low blood pressure
Muted heartbeat (through the stethoscope)
","The doctor will also look for possible signs of chronic heart failure, including:","
General physical weakness
Distended jugular veins (in the neck)
Fast or labored (difficult) breathing
Buildup of fluid in the abdomen (belly)
Swollen legs
","Rapid development of low blood pressure, muted heart sounds and distended jugular veins may indicate the life-threatening condition of cardiac tamponade.[1][9]","It is likely that the doctor will request further tests, such as an ECG or ultrasound, to confirm the diagnosis of pericardial effusion and establish the cause. Tests may include:[1][9]","
Blood tests: These can identify infections, autoimmune conditions, thyroid dysfunction, kidney failure and other possible underlying causes of pericardial effusion. Read more about blood tests.
Echocardiogram: A heart ultrasound scan or [echo will show the size and shape of the heart and whether fluid has accumulated in the pericardium. This type of scan, which is widely available, is particularly important in the diagnosis of pericardial effusion.
Electrocardiography (ECG or EKG): An ECG is a test that measures the heart’s electrical activity. Pericardial effusion may cause abnormal patterns to show on an ECG.
Chest X-ray: The heart may appear enlarged where there is significant pericardial effusion. It may have a “water bottle” shape.
CT or MRI: Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tests may present a clearer picture of the presence and size of pericardial effusion.
Pericardiocentesis: Removal of a small amount of fluid from the pericardium, using a needle, allows for testing for infections (e.g tuberculosis) and tumor markers.
","In addition, the doctor may ask for a pericardial biopsy to be performed.[1] In this procedure, a small amount of tissue is removed from the pericardium to test for infection and other possible causes of pericardial effusion.[10]",Pericardial effusion treatment,"Treatment of pericardial effusion depends on the cause and severity of the condition. The goals are to reduce symptoms, address the underlying cause, and prevent or manage complications.[1][6] In some cases where the effusion is small and uncomplicated, it may resolve on its own, with anti-inflammatory medication recommended to help the healing process.[11]",Treatment approaches may include:[1][2][12],"
Strategies to reduce symptoms: such as oxygen therapy where circulation is compromised, diuretics (water pills) and other heart failure medication
Strategies to treat complications: such as pericardiocentesis where cardiac tamponade is present
Strategies to identify and treat the underlying condition: such as pericardiocentesis, pericardial biopsy, antibiotics where a bacterial infection is present, steroids and other medications where rheumatoid arthritis is implicated, and chemotherapy, radiation therapy and other treatments where cancer is the cause
","In some cases, surgical treatment may be necessary.",Treating pericarditis (inflammation of the pericardium),"If pericarditis is present, treatment may include NSAIDs and, in certain cases, a course of colchicine – another type of medication that reduces inflammation. Colchicine may improve the prognosis and help prevent pericarditis recurring. If the pericarditis does not respond to treatment, a course of corticosteroids, such as prednisone, may be necessary.[13][14][15] In cases of acute pericarditis caused by myocardial infarction (heart attack), however, corticosteroids cannot be used, as they may negatively affect the healing process.[16]",Pericardiocentesis,"Large effusions that persist or are at risk of causing cardiac tamponade may be treated with pericardiocentesis. In this procedure, excess fluid is drained from the pericardium using a needle and catheter (thin tube). The doctor will typically rely on echocardiography (ultrasound) to guide the process.[1][4][8][12]",Pericardiostomy,"Where the pericardial effusion is very large and repeated pericardiocentesis has not been effective, surgery may be recommended. The following procedures may be used:","Subxiphoid pericardiostomy: Also called a “pericardial window”, this procedure can be performed under local anesthesia and has a high success rate. The doctor will make an incision under the breastbone and remove a small part of the pericardium to drain the excess fluid.[1][8]","Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery: This is also known as VATS or thoracoscopy. Although the procedure involves general anesthesia, it is minimally invasive – requiring only small incisions in the chest wall. The doctor will use a tiny camera to view the pericardium and make a more accurate diagnosis, and can then drain excess fluid by creating a small hole in the pericardium (pleuropericardial window).[17][18]",Alternatives to surgery,"Where surgery is not recommended, the following interventions may be used:","Percutaneous balloon pericardiotomy: During this procedure, a doctor inserts a needle into the pericardium via the chest wall. The needle is then replaced with a catheter, which has an inflatable balloon at the tip. This balloon is inflated to create a small hole in the pericardium through which excess fluid can be drained. Balloon pericardiotomy is predominantly used for repeated pericardial effusion that is caused by cancer.[1][8][19]","Intrapericardial sclerosis: In this procedure, a medication is administered to the pericardium to treat the effusion. Medications used include the antibiotics tetracycline and doxycycline and the chemotherapy drug cisplatin, among others.[1]",Complications of pericardial effusion,Cardiac tamponade,"This is a life-threatening condition that may develop from pericardial effusion. If the fluid exerts pressure on the heart to the extent that its pumping ability is compromised, immediate treatment is required to prevent mortality. Symptoms of cardiac tamponade may develop rapidly (within minutes or hours) and can include:","
Shortness of breath
Weakness and faintness
Nausea
Palpitations
Confusion or loss of consciousness
Blurred vision
","If you think that you might have signs of cardiac tamponade, call emergency services immediately.","Cardiac tamponade is treated with emergency pericardiocentesis or surgery. In severe cases, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may be required.[1][20][21]",Chronic pericardial effusion,"In some cases, large effusions may recur or persist for longer than six months and require ongoing medical treatment.[1] The affected individual may not experience any symptoms or problems. However, because pericardial effusion may lead to cardiac tamponade, going for regular check-ups and ensuring careful management of heart health is critical. The doctor may recommend pericardiocentesis to drain the cardiac effusion as a preventative measure.[6] In many cases, however, pericardiocentesis alone may prove inadequate, and a pericardiectomy may also be necessary.[2]","Small pericardial effusions that persist for a long period of time are fairly common, and are not as much of a concern as large effusions.",Pericardial effusion FAQs,"Q: What causes fluid around the heart?
A: Pericardial effusion can be caused by many different conditions that affect the membrane of the heart, resulting in pericarditis. These include viral and bacterial infections such as tuberculosis, as well as kidney failure, cancer, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and inadequately managed hypothyroidism, chest injuries, heart attack and heart surgery, and some medications. In many cases, the cause of pericardial effusion is unknown.","Q: Is pericardial effusion serious?
A: Pericardial effusion can be serious. Many cases are mild and do not cause any symptoms or long-term health problems, but some cases - particularly those that develop rapidly and involve a large buildup of fluid - can lead to life-threatening complications such as cardiac tamponade. If you think that you might have signs of pericardial effusion, it is recommended that you contact a doctor without delay.","Q: Can pericardial effusion return?
A: Yes, pericardial effusion can recur. Many cases clear up and do not come back, but in some cases chronic pericardial effusion may develop. See the section on chronic pericardial effusion above for more details.","Q: Pericardial effusion vs. cardiac tamponade – what is the difference?
A: Pericardial effusion is the term for an accumulation of fluid around the heart. The amount of fluid may be small or large, and the condition is not always serious or life-threatening. Cardiac tamponade is a rare but life-threatening possible complication of pericardial effusion and other heart conditions. Cardiac tamponade is when fluid exerts pressure on the heart, impeding its ability to pump and sometimes leading to cardiac arrest. Cardiac tamponade may develop very quickly and requires emergency treatment to prevent mortality.[1][22]","Q: Pericardial effusion vs. pericarditis - what is the difference?
A: Pericardial effusion is the term for a buildup of fluid around the heart. The membrane around the heart is called the pericardium; this is a sac made up of two layers of tissue with lubricating fluid in the middle. If this fluid increases beyond normal levels, it is called pericardial effusion. Pericarditis is the term for inflammation of the pericardium. Pericarditis can cause pericardial effusion.","Q: Pericardial effusion vs. pleural effusion - what is the difference?
A: Pericardial effusion is the term for a buildup of fluid around the heart. Pleural effusion is the term for a buildup of fluid around the lungs, or, more accurately, in the space between the lungs and the chest cavity.[23]","Q: Is there a connection between pericardial effusion and cancer?
A: Yes. Cancer may be a cause of pericardial effusion where it has spread to the pericardium. These cases of pericardial effusion are very serious and require urgent medical treatment.[12] The types of cancer that most commonly cause pericardial effusion include lung cancer, breast cancer, leukemia and lymphoma.[24]","Q: Can pericardial effusion be prevented?
A: It is not usually possible to prevent pericardial effusion. However, steps can be taken to prevent the condition becoming more serious or developing into cardiac tamponade. These steps include:[25]","

The surgery may take several hours to complete. The surgeon will typically make an incision through the breastbone and carefully remove part or all of the pericardium. If all or almost all of the membrane is removed, it may be called a total, complete or radical pericardiectomy.[11] The incision will then be closed up and dressed, and the anesthesia will be reversed, so that the person wakes up.[^3][3]",After pericardiectomy: postoperative care and recovery,"After the surgery, it is normal to feel groggy and a little disoriented. A doctor will monitor blood pressure, heart rate and other vital signs, and a drainage tube will be inserted into the chest to remove excess fluid. Side-effects may include some pain, but it is unlikely to be severe. The doctor will provide painkillers and other medication as required, and advise on when liquids and food can be reintroduced.[^3]","A pericardiectomy is a major surgical procedure that will typically require a hospital stay of five to seven days. The person will generally be advised to avoid heavy lifting in the recovery stage, which may take up to two months. Feelings of tiredness may be experienced during the recovery period and exercise may have to be limited, though it should be possible to resume many daily activities quite quickly after the surgery.[^3][3]","The doctor may schedule follow-up appointments to remove any stitches and check the functioning of the heart. Additionally, a person’s heart medication may need to be adjusted after the surgery.

A: A pericardiectomy is a major surgical procedure that is performed to remove a section or all of the pericardium – the membrane around the heart. It is typically used to provide relief from chronic constrictive pericarditis, where the pericardium has become thick and stiff.[^3]","A pericardial window is a less-invasive technique that can be performed under local anesthesia, where a small part of the pericardium is removed to drain excess fluid from the membrane. It is also known as subxiphoid pericardiostomy and is generally used to provide relief from large or recurrent pericardial effusions, rather than thickened pericardial tissue.[16][17]","Q: What is the difference between a pericardiectomy and pericardiotomy?
A: In a pericardiectomy, part or all of the pericardium, the membrane around the heart, is removed to provide relief from chronic constrictive pericarditis. A pericardiotomy, generally understood to be a percutaneous balloon pericardiotomy, is a less invasive procedure used to drain excess fluid from the pericardium. It typically involves the insertion of a catheter – a thin tube – with a balloon tip, which is inflated to create a small hole in the pericardium. This procedure is typically used in the treatment of recurrent pericardial effusions, and sometimes also to reduce the risk of developing atrial fibrillation, an abnormal heart rhythm, after heart surgery.[18][19]","Q: What is the pericardiectomy mortality rate?
A: Compared to other more minor types of surgery, the mortality rate for pericardiectomy is somewhat higher. However, the majority of people who undergo a pericardiectomy will survive and experience long-term relief from constrictive pericarditis. The outlook is influenced by the cause and stage of the constrictive pericarditis, as well as the age and overall health of the person.[6][12] A doctor will be able to provide details on the risks and benefits of pericardiectomy for a particular person."
,,,,,,,,,,What is pericarditis?
,,,,,,,,,,What is pericarditis?,"Pericarditis is a term for inflammation of the pericardium – the membrane around the heart. The pericardium, which keeps the heart in place and prevents friction from surrounding organs, is a sac comprised of two layers of tissue with lubricating fluid in between. When pericarditis occurs, this tissue becomes inflamed and may rub against the heart, causing chest pain that is sometimes mistaken for a heart attack.[1][2][3]","Pericarditis is a relatively common heart condition – it is estimated to be the cause of five percent of visits to hospital emergency rooms for chest pain. It can affect people of all ages, but is most common in men between 20 and 50 years old.[1][4][5]","In most cases, the cause of pericarditis is unknown. Viral infections are a common trigger, but the cause may also be another type of infection, a chest injury, heart attack or heart surgery, another medical condition, or certain medicines – such as penicillin and some chemotherapy drugs. Pericarditis may develop suddenly and be short-lived (acute), or develop over time and be a chronic condition.[3][4][6]","Most cases of acute pericarditis are mild and clear up on their own within a few days to a number of weeks with rest and medication to reduce the inflammation. However, roughly 20 to 50 percent of people treated for acute pericarditis may go on to develop recurrent pericarditis, which requires long-term treatment. Though uncommon in pericarditis, life-threatening complications like cardiac tamponade and constrictive pericarditis may occur and necessitate immediate intervention. In all cases, the prognosis depends largely on the cause of the pericarditis.[1][2][4][5]",Pericarditis symptoms,Main symptoms of pericarditis:[7][8],"The most common symptom of pericarditis is chest pain. This may develop suddenly and be experienced as a sharp, stabbing sensation behind the breastbone on the left side of the body. However, for some people there may be a constant, steady pain, or more of a dull ache or feeling of pressure.","The chest pain may radiate into the left shoulder and neck, and tends to be worse when breathing deeply, coughing, swallowing or lying down. Sitting up or leaning forward may ease the pain.",Other symptoms of pericarditis:,Individuals experiencing pericarditis may also present with:[5][7][8][9],"
Fever
Fatigue or weakness
Shortness of breath (particularly if cardiac tamponade develops)
Difficulty breathing or rapid breathing
Rapid heartbeat
Palpitations (the feeling that the heart is skipping a beat or pounding)
Nausea
Chills
Cough
Swelling of the legs or abdomen
Low blood pressure (in severe cases)
","If any symptoms are present and pericarditis is suspected, medical advice should be sought immediately.",Causes of pericarditis,"Viruses are the most common cause of acute pericarditis. A number of different viruses are associated with the heart condition, including, among others:[5][7][^10]","
Coxsackieviruses
Echoviruses
Adenoviruses (e.g. the common cold, pneumonia)
HIV
Influenza
Hepatitis viruses
",Other causes of pericarditis include:[3][5][7][^10],"
Bacterial infection (usually spread from nearby tissues, or wounds after heart surgery)
Tuberculosis
Fungi and parasites
Kidney failure
Heart attack or heart surgery
Chest injury (e.g. a stab wound or car accident)
Radiotherapy to treat cancers in the chest
Cancer that has spread from another part of the body (rare)
Autoimmune conditions (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus)
Inflammatory bowel disease (e.g. ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease)
Certain medications (e.g. penicillin, phenytoin, warfarin and rifampin)
","In many cases, no cause can be identified and the condition is termed idiopathic pericarditis.","The cause of recurrent pericarditis is unknown, though it is thought that irregularities in the immune system may play a role. Pericarditis may result from autoimmune conditions like systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma, where the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue or cells.[1]",Diagnosis of pericarditis,The first step in diagnosing pericarditis will be for a doctor to take the affected person’s medical history and perform a physical examination. The doctor will typically listen to the heart using a stethoscope to check for a common sign of pericarditis known as a pericardial friction rub (or pericardial rub). This is a distinct rasping or grating noise caused by the inflamed pericardial layers rubbing against each other.[3][7][10],"The doctor will also listen for signs of excess fluid in the pericardium (pericardial effusion) or lungs (pleural effusion). A small amount of excess fluid in the pericardium is not a cause for great concern and usually clears up on its own. However, if the fluid builds up, it may lead to the potentially life-threatening condition known as cardiac tamponade. This can cause serious complications, including compromised pumping function of the heart, and requires urgent medical treatment.[7]","If pericarditis is suspected, the doctor may order imaging and laboratory tests to confirm the diagnosis and differentiate it from other conditions like heart attack and peptic ulcer disease. These tests could include any of the following:[3][5][7][11]","
Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG): A test that traces the heart’s electrical activity. Pericarditis may produce abnormal patterns.
Chest X-ray: While most people with acute pericarditis have a normal X-ray, this test can show an enlarged heart where there is significant pericardial effusion, and help rule out other causes.
Echocardiogram: A heart ultrasound scan that shows the size, shape and movement of the heart, and whether fluid has accumulated in the pericardium. An echocardiogram can indicate whether the fluid is causing cardiac tamponade.
Blood tests: These can detect underlying infections, as well as the presence of inflammatory markers.
","In addition, the doctor may request a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to obtain a more detailed image of the heart and surrounding organs. If tuberculosis is suspected, the doctor may also decide to take a sample of fluid from the pericardium, using a needle and syringe.",Pericarditis classification and treatment,"Treatment depends on the severity and type of the pericarditis. The goals are to relieve pain and reduce inflammation, address the underlying cause where possible, and detect and manage possible complications.[12]",Acute pericarditis,"A doctor will assess whether the affected person can safely be treated at home, or whether they need to be admitted to hospital. People who present with a high fever, signs of cardiac tamponade or serious pericardial effusion, or who have recently been treated with blood thinners are likely to be admitted to hospital as they have an increased risk of complications. In addition, if outpatient treatment is not successful, hospital admission will typically be required.[3][13]","Where hospitalization is unnecessary, a doctor may advise the affected person to rest at home and prescribe anti-inflammatory medication, such as aspirin or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) like ibuprofen to reduce pain and inflammation.[7][12][13]","If the pain is severe or the symptoms do not improve within two weeks, colchicine – a medication that reduces inflammation – may be prescribed. Colchicine improves the outlook of pericarditis and reduces the likelihood of it recurring. If the pericarditis does not respond to this treatment, a course of corticosteroids (like prednisone) may be recommended. Because the risk of recurrent pericarditis may increase when steroids are used, they tend to be prescribed with caution. In cases of acute pericarditis caused by myocardial infarction (heart attack), corticosteroids cannot be used, as they may negatively affect the healing process. If the cause of pericarditis is bacterial, antibiotics may be prescribed.[3][5][7][12][13]",Recurrent pericarditis,"Repeat episodes of pericarditis are typically managed in the same way as acute pericarditis, with anti-inflammatory medication prescribed to relieve pain and reduce inflammation. A long-term course of colchicine may help prevent a relapse of symptoms. Corticosteroids are usually used as a last resort.","Recurrent pericarditis, also known as relapsing pericarditis, may be incessant – where there is a relapse within six weeks of stopping treatment (this may be a continuation of the first episode of pericarditis), or intermittent – where more than six weeks pass between relapses (a true recurrence). The condition may be debilitating.[3][13][14][15]","Where recurrent pericarditis is severe and unresponsive to treatment, surgery may be recommended. The procedure is called a pericardiectomy and involves the removal of a part or most of the pericardium.[3][14]",Constrictive pericarditis,"This is a rare but serious potential complication of pericarditis. It develops when the pericardium is inflamed for a long period of time, and subsequently thickens and contracts around the heart – compromising its functioning. Symptoms of constrictive pericarditis may include swelling of the legs, ankles and other parts of the body, tiredness and shortness of breath.[3][7]","Constrictive pericarditis may be transient or chronic. Where the condition is chronic, a pericardiectomy is typically the only effective treatment. If constrictive pericarditis is suspected, medical advice should be sought immediately.[14][16]",Chronic effusive pericarditis,"This condition involves fluid accumulating slowly between the two layers of the pericardium without necessarily leading to cardiac tamponade. Symptoms may include chest pain, lightheadedness and shortness of breath.[14][17][18]","Large, persistent pericardial effusions may be drained, or the condition may be treated with one of the following interventions:[5]","
Balloon pericardiotomy – where a balloon-tipped catheter (thin tube) is used to create a hole in the pericardium to drain the fluid.[19]
Surgical pericardial window – where a small part of the pericardium is opened to drain the fluid. Also known as a subxiphoid pericardiostomy.[20]
Sclerosis of the pericardial sac with tetracycline or other substances – administration of a substance to stiffen the tissue, so that the two layers can stick together. Doing this can help prevent a build-up of fluid.[21]
",Cardiac tamponade,"This is a rare but life-threatening possible complication of pericarditis, where fluid builds up in the pericardium and exerts pressure on the heart, compromising its ability to function. Cardiac tamponade seems to be more common in cases of pericarditis caused by tuberculosis or cancer. Symptoms may develop suddenly (within minutes or hours) and can include:","
Weakness
Faintness
Fatigue
Nausea
Severe shortness of breath
Palpitations (the feeling that the heart is skipping a beat or pounding)
Confusion
Low blood pressure with blurred vision and fainting
Loss of consciousness
","Emergency treatment is essential and typically involves a procedure called pericardiocentesis, where excess fluid in the pericardium is removed via the chest wall using a needle or tube.[3][14][17][16]",Pericarditis FAQs,"Q: What is effusive-constrictive pericarditis?
A: Effusive-constrictive pericarditis is a serious condition in which constrictive pericarditis is present together with pericardial effusion (often with cardiac tamponade). It seems to be more prevalent in cases of pericarditis caused by tuberculosis. Treatment may include pericardiocentesis to relieve pressure on the heart muscle, anti-inflammatory medications, corticosteroids, and – in some cases – pericardiectomy.[14][22][23]","Q: Can pericarditis be prevented?
A: It is not usually possible to prevent pericarditis. However, steps can be taken to reduce the likelihood of experiencing a repeat episode of pericarditis, chronic pericarditis, or complications from pericarditis. These steps include:[12]","

,,,,,,,,,,What is peripheral vascular disease?
,,,,,,,,,,What is peripheral vascular disease?,"Peripheral vascular disease (PVD), also known as peripheral arterial disease, is a common condition in which there is a slow narrowing and hardening of the blood vessels in the legs. This causes poor blood flow and a lack of oxygen to the feet and legs. Smokers are mainly affected. Other risk factors are diabetes, high blood cholesterol and high blood pressure. Typical symptoms are pain, numbness, paleness, burning and heaviness of the legs. The diagnosis can often be made based on the symptoms and physical exam in a person who has risk factors for developing this condition. Treatment involves some lifestyle changes, getting good control of other medical conditions, and, if symptoms are severe, surgery. If this condition is not actively managed, the on-going lack of oxygen can cause the tissues in the feet and leg to die, and in the worse case, this may require amputation.",Risks,"Peripheral vascular disease is the medical term for blood vessels (arteries) which do not effectively transport blood to the legs. When a tissue (a substance which makes up the body) doesn't get enough blood and oxygen, it is slow to heal after an injury and can eventually die. The most common cause for this is the formation of fatty collections in the blood vessels which eventually cause narrowing and slow or stop blood flow. These are more likely to form in people who smoke, who do not take enough exercise, and those who have other medical conditions, especially diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels. This condition tends to affect people over 50 years of age, and becomes slightly more common with age. Men tend to be more commonly affected than women.",Symptoms,"Common symptoms include pain, paleness, burning and heaviness of the legs or feet. These may start mild and worsen over the time.  Many people also experience a painful aching in the leg muscles while exercising which gets better with rest. Other symptoms may be a loss of the hair on the legs, difficulty feeling a pulse in the feet and a blue or purple tinge to the skin. Erectile dysfunction may also be a symptom of this condition in men.",Diagnosis,"The diagnosis is often suspected based on the symptoms and examination of the legs and hands, especially in people who are known to be at risk of developing this condition. An ultrasound which specifically looks at blood flow through blood vessels is commonly done. In some cases, especially before surgery, a scan using dye to closely look at the blood vessels (an angiogram) may be done.",Treatment,"Treatment of peripheral vascular disease involves lifestyle changes, treating any other medical conditions and, sometimes, surgery. Giving up smoking, eating a balanced diet and taking regular exercise can help to stop the peripheral vascular disease from getting worse. Getting good control of other medical conditions, especially high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes can also help to stop the progression of this disease and prevent the complications of this condition. If the condition is causing severe symptoms, surgery to bypass the blockage or the remove the plaques may be needed.",Prevention,"Giving up smoking, eating a balanced diet and taking regular exercise can help to prevent this condition.

Later the typical 'whooping cough' may develop, which can last for up to 10 weeks. The whooping cough is characterized by severe coughing attacks ending with a 'whoop' sound during the next breath of air. Many people may not develop the characteristic 'whooping cough' but experience severe uncontrollable attacks of coughing. Infants may have breathing difficulties but no cough.",Treatment,"The treatment consists of antibiotics and rest. If severe breathing problems occur, the sick person may require admission to hospital for treatment of these.",Prevention,"A vaccination against pertussis is available for children and adults, but not newborn infants. Children are routinely vaccinated against pertussis in the first year of life, with a booster at preschool age, so keeping to the recommended vaccination schedule is important. Family members and carers of newborns should have booster vaccinations against pertussis. Pregnant women should ensure their vaccination is up to date during the third trimester. It is important for a person infected with pertussis to avoid social contact (work, school, public transport, etc.) to avoid infecting other people.",Other names for pertussis,"

,,,,,,,,,,What are plantar warts?
,,,,,,,,,,What are plantar warts?,"Plantar warts, sometimes called verrucas, are a type of wart found on the sole of the foot or the toes, most commonly in weight-bearing locations such as the heel. They are a very common type of wart, especially in children, and are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV) – a common viral infection of the skin. HPV infections in locations other than the foot are not classed as plantar warts.","HPV is contagious, meaning plantar warts can be passed from person to person, either through direct skin-to-skin contact or indirectly through contact with a surface or object that carries the virus.

Also at risk are people in a weakened state of health due to illness, poor nutrition or a compromised immune system from conditions such as asthma, HIV/AIDS, lymphoma, diabetes, leukemia or heart disease. Smokers and people who abuse alcohol are also more likely to get pneumonia.","Along with these health issues, people who are hospitalized, particularly if they are using a machine for respiratory support (ventilator), are at risk of hospital-acquired pneumonia. People undergoing chemotherapy, organ donors and recipients or people on long-term steroids can have a weakened immune system that makes them more susceptible.[9]",Enter your symptoms in the Ada app and begin your personal health assessment.,Pneumonia diagnosis,"The first step in diagnosing pneumonia is a physical examination, in which a doctor will check for rapid breathing and a blue or purple tint to the lips, fingernails or hands, which can indicate low levels of blood oxygen. As part of this check, they will use pulse oximetry to test for oxygenation in the blood, using a sensor clipped to a finger.","They will also listen to the chest using a stethoscope to check for unusual noises, such as a crackling sound.","The next step is typically a chest X-ray to confirm the diagnosis, and this confirmation may give the doctor enough information to begin treatment.[10] Depending on the symptoms and their severity, though, the doctor may request further testing including:","
Blood tests to check for the presence, type or spread of infection, as well as the level of oxygen in the blood.
Sputum test to culture a sample of material coughed up from the lungs to check for infection or identify the microorganism responsible.
Chest CT scan to provide similar information about the presence of infection inside of the lungs as an X-ray, but in greater detail by combining computer imaging and X-ray technology.
Bronchoscopy to visually inspect the bronchi – the main pathways of the lungs – to evaluate the extent of the infection, as well as to take samples of tissue and fluid, using a camera attached to a flexible tube that is threaded into the airways. This test is more common in severe cases of pneumonia or if the treatment does not respond to antibiotics.
Pleural fluid sample to check fluid between the lungs and the chest wall for infection, using a long, thin needle.
",Pneumonia treatment,"Antibiotics may be used to treat bacterial, mycoplasmal and some other types of pneumonia, and antifungal medications may be used for fungal pneumonia. Viral pneumonia cannot be treated with antibiotics, but it usually resolves on its own.[1]","Most people recover at home rather than at the hospital. The most common treatment for pneumonia involves supporting the body’s health and immune system, such as improving the affected person’s diet, fluid intake or rest. Other treatments may include lowering the fever or administering oxygen. A younger person might recover from pneumonia in a few days while taking antibiotics, while a person over 60 years of age or who has a chronic health condition might be hospitalized for monitoring and treatment.","Some people take over-the-counter-painkillers such as aspirin, acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil). Although some people use cough suppressants, some coughing is necessary to remove built-up fluid and mucus from the lungs and airways.",Possible complications of pneumonia,"Most people treated for pneumonia recover successfully, but, in some cases, it can be a life-threatening condition. People who are very young or over 60 years of age, or who have chronic health conditions, are at greater risk of complications. These can include respiratory failure or its more extreme form, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which might require a person to be treated with a ventilator or respirator.","If the infection enters the bloodstream, sepsis can occur. Sometimes, pneumonia can cause empyema, in which infected packets of pus and fluid collect along or inside the lungs, and may need to be treated with surgery.","Pneumonia can worsen some chronic conditions, such as emphysema and congestive heart failure. It can also make some people more likely to have a heart attack.[6]",Feeling unwell? Start your free symptom assessment in the Ada app,Pneumonia prevention,"Two vaccines, PCV13 (Prevnar 13) and PPSV23 (Pneumovax), are available in the US to prevent pneumonia. These vaccines cannot prevent all cases of pneumonia, but if a vaccinated person contracts pneumonia, it is likely to be of shorter duration and with fewer complications. Both vaccines are recommended for older people.[11]",Children younger than five should receive a series of four vaccinations with PCV13. There is some evidence that zinc supplementation can prevent pneumonia in children.[12] Keeping up-to-date with vaccinations and maintaining overall good health can help older people prevent pneumonia.,People with some chronic health conditions may be offered these vaccinations and people between 19-64 years of age who smoke might consider being vaccinated with Pneumovax – though quitting smoking will make them less vulnerable to pneumonia and other infections.,"A flu shot can be helpful in preventing all types of pneumonia; the body is more likely to be susceptible to pneumonia, and other infections when its immune system is weakened by flu.","Anyone can follow basic precautions to prevent pneumonia, including washing their hands regularly to avoid the spread of infection and maintaining a healthy lifestyle, such as eating a healthy diet and getting enough rest and exercise.",Pneumonia FAQs,"Q: Is pneumonia contagious?
A: Pneumonia itself is not contagious, but the bacteria, viruses and other microorganisms that lead to this kind of infection can be communicated from person to person. Therefore, the same precautions that prevent the spread of cold and flus can also help prevent transmission of pneumonia.","Q: Which population groups should ensure that they are vaccinated against pneumonia?
A: As a matter of course, all children younger than five should receive a series of four vaccinations with PCV13 (Prevnar 13). It is recommended that adults be vaccinated against pneumonia if they meet one or more of the following criteria:","
Are over 65
Use tobacco products (in particular, products which involve smoking)
Are affected by alcohol addiction
Have, or have had, cochlear implants or cerebrospinal fluid leaks
Are affected by ongoing conditions, such as diabetes, diseases of the heart, lungs, spleen or kidneys, or conditions with compromise the function of the immune system, such as HIV.
","Q: What are the differences between pneumonia and double pneumonia?
A: It is possible to be affected by pneumonia in one or both lungs. Double pneumonia is a term used to refer to cases where both of a person’s lungs are infected. It is a common misconception that double pneumonia is more severe than pneumonia which relates to one lung. In fact, it is equally possible to be affected by a mild infection in both lungs, as it is for a severe infection to affect one lung. The potential causes, symptoms, risk factors and treatment options for pneumonia are the same whether it is double or not. Always seek medical attention promptly if pneumonia is suspected."
,,,,,,,,,,What is pneumothorax?
,,,,,,,,,,What is pneumothorax?,"Pneumothorax is a condition in which there is air in the chest (the thorax) which is outside of the lungs. This air pushes on the lung which prevents it from being able to expand fully. Signs of this condition are sudden chest pain and often breathing problems. Sometimes a pneumothorax can occur without any particular cause, but it is most common after an injury to the chest. The symptoms often include shortness of breath and chest pain. A small pneumothorax may not need any particular treatment, but a larger pneumothorax may to have the air let out to help improve breathing. Although this condition can be life-threatening, most people recover well with treatment.",Risks,"Pneumothorax is the medical term for when air enters areas of the chest (the thorax) which are outside of the lungs. This air takes up space inside the chest and presses on the outside of the lungs. This stops the lungs from being able to expand fully. Pneumothorax can occur following an injury to the chest, due to an underlying lung condition, or can happen without a particular cause. A pneumothorax after an injury can occur in people of any age. Pneumothorax due to an underlying lung condition is more common in older adults, especially people with emphysema or asthma. Pneumothorax with no particular cause is most common in tall, thin, young men, and this condition may run in families. Smokers may also be more likely to develop this condition.",Symptoms,"The most common symptoms of a pneumothorax are a sharp, one-sided chest pain and shortness of breath. The pain may be worse when taking a breath in. People with a small pneumothorax may only have mild symptoms. People with a large pneumothorax tend to have more severe symptoms and require emergency treatment. The symptoms of this include severe shortness of breath, blue fingers and lips, anxiety, confusion and, possibly, collapse.",Diagnosis,The diagnosis can be made based on the symptoms and by carrying out a physical examination. X-rays of the chest are often needed to confirm the diagnosis.,Treatment,Treatment of pneumothorax depends on the size of the air collection in the chest and the severity of the symptoms. A small pneumothorax may not require any particular treatment. People with troublesome symptoms need emergency treatment. This may involve emergency treatments to give extra oxygen and an emergency procedure to remove the air from the chest.

,,,,,,,,,,What is podagra?
,,,,,,,,,,What is podagra?,"Podagra, which in Greek translates to ‘foot trap’, is gout which affects the joint located between the foot and the big toe, known as the metatarsophalangeal joint.","Gout, also known as gouty arthritis, results in recurrent, acute attacks of joint pain and inflammation. This is normally caused by hyperuricemia, chronically high levels of uric acid in the blood, which can cause small urate crystals to form in and around the joints. Gout tends to start in one joint, often that of the big toe, before spreading to others. Podagra is the first joint manifestation in about half of all cases of gout and is eventually seen in about 90 percent of cases.[1] If you think you may be experiencing signs of podagra and gout, see the Ada app for a free symptom assessment.","Certain foods, especially red meat or organ meats such as liver or kidneys, as well as oily fish, drinking alcohol, and conditions such as high blood pressure or obesity may lead to the production of higher than normal levels of urate - a salt of uric acid - in the body. Gout mainly affects people over 30 years old and tends to affect more men than women.",Podagra symptoms,"Podagra causes severe pain in the metatarsophalangeal joint, which is the joint at the base of the big toe. The onset of podagra is characterized by intense attacks of pain, usually sudden and often at night. It is not clear how, but even without treatment, the body normally resolves a gout flare on its own. Untreated attacks normally last about 5-10 days, though the pain is most severe in the first 12-24 hours, after which time it usually improves over a few days to several weeks.","The most common podagra flare symptoms result from inflammation localized in the metatarsophalangeal joint (big toe joint), including:[2][3]","
Severe pain
Swelling
Redness
Sensation of heat
Difficulty moving the joint
",Less common symptoms of a gout attack include:[2][3],"
Tophi: uric acid crystal deposits appearing as firm, yellowish nodules on the joint
Fever
Fatigue
","Without preventive measures, the average time between the first attack and a recurrence is about one year, though podagra may recur much sooner, or it may never happen again. Subsequent attacks of podagra may last longer than the initial one, and may lead to damage in the metatarsophalangeal joint, with difficulty walking becoming permanent in some cases. In cases of chronic gout, also known as chronic gouty arthritis, a person may experience symptoms of inflammation most or all of the time.","If you think you may be experiencing symptoms of podagra and gout, try the Ada app for a free symptom assessment.",Podagra causes,"Podagra is a manifestation of gout, in which uric acid crystallizes and settles in one or more joints. This is often caused either by excess amounts of uric acid being produced, or not enough being excreted from the urine on a chronic basis. Any abrupt increase in the level of uric acid in the blood may also trigger an attack of podagra or gout.","Most people with elevated blood levels of uric acid will never develop podagra and gout, and gout is not always associated with elevated uric acid blood levels; the condition can also occur despite there being normal levels of uric acid at the point in time when blood levels are measured.[4]",It is thought to develop due to an immune response. White blood cells and joint-lining cells may attempt to surround and digest urate crystal deposits. The chemical signals sent out by these cells contribute to the characteristic inflammation of podagra specifically and gout in general.,"Uric acid crystals tend to settle in the big toe, as in the case of podagra. This joint is where there tends to be increased impact from walking and supporting the weight of the body. Uric acid crystals are also less soluble under acid conditions and in cooler temperatures, as occur in the big toe and other extremities, such as the hands and feet.[1][5] Attacks tend to happen at night and are thought to be made more likely by a lower body temperature.",Podagra risk factors,"There are many medical conditions and lifestyle factors that may increase the risk of developing podagra, a special form of gout, including:[1][6]","
Diabetes
Obesity
Fasting or overeating protein rich foods
High blood pressure
Taking medications that alter urate blood levels, especially diuretics, such as for heart failure or high blood pressure
Kidney disease, especially chronic kidney disease
Being a man older than about 30
Being a woman who has experienced menopause
Regularly drinking excessive amounts of alcohol, especially rum, whisky, vodka, gin and beer
Eating large amounts of red meat or organ meats, such as liver or kidneys, or certain oily fish such as anchovies or trout
Consuming large amounts of fructose, such as in beverages containing high fructose corn syrup
","Some rare medical conditions may increase the risk of developing gout in general and podagra as a special form of gout, such as conditions which result in:[6]","High cell turnover: This may be caused by certain autoimmune conditions, such as psoriasis, a scaly skin condition, or as a side effect of certain medications, such as with tumor lysis syndrome, in which large amounts of tumor cells are killed off (lysed) by treatment, releasing their contents into the bloodstream.","Enzyme defects: This may be caused by certain genetic disorders which cause disordered processing of uric acid , such as Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, also known as juvenile gout.","In people who have had a gout flare-up, there are factors that may increase the risk of recurrence, including:[6]","
Injury to the foot
Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol.[7]
Fasting or overeating protein rich foods
Taking medications that alter urate blood levels. These medicines are necessary for the management of other conditions, and should not be stopped or adjusted without a doctor’s supervision.
",Diagnosis,There are many conditions that may cause joint inflammation. Podagra is suspected if risk factors are present and a person has an acute attack of pain in the joint of the big toe.,"The most definitive way for a doctor to make a diagnosis of gout and podagra is by taking a sample of fluid from a swollen joint and to look for evidence of gout crystals in the joint, using a needle and syringe to withdraw a small amount of joint fluid. Tophaceous gout – chronic gout in which hard lumps made of uric acid crystals (tophi) form around a joint – may be diagnosed by sampling the tophi, located right beneath the skin.","If joint fluid analysis is not possible, tentative diagnosis may be made based on the person's medical history, symptoms, a physical examination, and urine and blood tests to assess uric acid levels. The Ada app can also offer a free assessment of your symptoms.","Good to know: Hyperuricemia - high levels of uric acid in the blood - is not necessarily diagnostic of gout. Uric acid  levels in the blood may fluctuate over the day, and gout may also be triggered  by an abrupt drop in uric acid levels, so gout could be present despite uric acid levels being normal at the point in time when blood is drawn.[8] Blood tests may also be analyzed for other indicators of gout or factors which may increase its likelihood, such as levels of white blood cells, triglycerides, high-density lipoproteins, glucose, as well as renal and liver function.",Ultrasound scans or X-rays of the affected joint may be helpful to look for signs of damage as a result of persistent gout.[9][10],Treating a podagra attack,"In the case of a first attack, or if a person experiences attacks less than twice a year without tophi and/or very high uric acid levels, treatment is usually limited to the duration of an attack by using medication to relieve pain and inflammation. A doctor may prescribe medication to keep on hand for use in the event of a future attack. Which medication and dose to use is determined based on a number of factors, includings kidney health, ulcer history and the person’s risk of bleeding. Possible medications include:[11]","
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): NSAIDs such as e.g. ibuprofen are effective when used as early as possible in a podagra attack and when taken in higher doses to achieve anti-inflammatory, not just pain-relieving properties. A doctor will be able to recommend the appropriate type and dose. Aspirin should be avoided for podagra and gout, as it can raise or lower uric acid levels, potentially making the condition worse.
Colchicine: This may be prescribed in pill form for those who cannot tolerate NSAIDs. Colchicine seems to be most effective when started within the first 24 hours of an attack.
Glucocorticoids: These may be given orally, by intra-articular (into the joint) injection, or occasionally by intravenous (IV) or intramuscular injection.
","Good to know: It is recommended to rest the affected foot as much as possible by avoiding walking, or using a cane or splint to avoid putting weight on the foot. The swelling may also be brought down by elevating the foot and keeping it cool with an ice pack for 20 minutes at a time.",Chronic podagra treatment and uric acid-lowering medication,"Podagra may become chronic, in which there are repeated episodes of pain and inflammation, which may also spread to multiple joints and lead to joint damage and disability. In cases of chronic podagra and gout, a uric acid-lowering regimen may be recommended to prevent or reverse the crystal deposits that lead to and worsen chronic gout.","Those with more than two gouty attacks per year, joint damage as seen on a radiograph, or tophi (uric acid crystals) may be given uric acid-lowering medication, such as allopurinol.","Good to know: Allopurinol should not be taken until the end of an acute attack, as acute drops in uric acid could prolong the attack.[8]","During the first six months of uric acid-lowering medication, medication to reduce inflammation may be provided. This is because uric acid-lowering medications change serum and tissue uric acid levels, and so may trigger acute attacks of podagra and gout. Medication to treat swelling and pain, as well as to lessen any damage caused by podagra attacks may include:[2]","NSAIDs are sometimes given for daily use, and have an advantage for people who also have osteoarthritis. This decreases swelling and potential joint damage.",Colchicine may be given at a low dose to prevent gastrointestinal side effects which may occur at higher doses of NSAID use. Colchicine works by decreasing swelling and lessening the buildup of uric acid crystals.,Lifestyle changes may also be helpful in the management of gout and podagra. These include:[4][12],"
Losing weight, if overweight: Can greatly reduce urate levels. Should be combined with regular exercise. Rapid weight loss should be avoided, as this can raise urate levels.
Drinking plenty of water: Can reduce the risk of uric acid crystals forming in the joints. Sugary drinks should be avoided, as high levels of fructose are likely to increase blood urate levels.
Avoiding excessive alcohol consumption: Beer and spirits are especially likely to increase urate levels.
Close management of blood pressure and diabetes management if appropriate
Maintaining a healthy diet: Foods rich in purines, chemical compounds made naturally by the body, but also found in high levels in certain foods, may worsen podagra and gout. Foods to be avoided include red meat, organ meats and certain oily fish, such as anchovies or mackerel. Plenty of vitamin C-rich fruit and vegetables should be eaten, as they help the kidneys to remove urate.
",Podagra FAQs,"Q: Why does gout target the big toe?
A: Podagra is the first joint manifestation in about half of all cases of gout, and is eventually seen in about 90 percent of cases. Uric acid crystals tend to settle in the big toe, where there is normally increased stress from walking and supporting the weight of the body. Furthermore these crystals are also less soluble under acid conditions and at the cooler joints in the extremities, such as the big toe.","Q: What does a podagra attack feel like?
A: Podagra typically comes on suddenly, often with a few hours and often at night, thought to be because this is when the body temperature lowers. The toe or foot becomes swollen, red, hot and can be very painful. Sometimes a person will also experience fever and fatigue. The attack usually gets better within three days, but may not completely resolve for several weeks.",Other names for podagra,"

This virus infects the nervous system and may lead to muscle weakness or paralysis (inability to move muscles at all). This condition is very uncommon as immunization has caused the virus to be eradicated from many countries. People who are not immunized against polio and who travel to areas where the poliovirus is still active have a risk of getting a polio infection. Children under 5 years of age are most commonly affected. Symptoms may include fever, sore throat, headaches and aching muscles. Some, but not all, people go on to develop muscle weakness. Poliovirus infection cannot be cured and the treatment usually only controls the symptoms. The outlook after a poliovirus infection depends on the severity of the symptoms, but it can cause permanent disability and death.",Risks,"Polio is caused by the polio virus. The virus is transmitted through direct contact with an infected person or through infected mucus and feces. Although this virus has been removed from most countries in the world, episodes or outbreak of polio still occur. Outbreaks tend to occur more commonly in the summer months. Although people of any age group can become infected, children under the age of 5 years are most commonly affected. The people who are not vaccinated against polio and who travel to areas where poliovirus is still active are at risk of getting infected.",Symptoms,"Early symptoms of a poliovirus infection resemble the flu and include fever, headache, vomiting, feeling ill and sore throat. These symptoms will often get better within a few days, and most people will have no further symptoms. If the virus spreads to the nervous system, it can cause muscle weakness in the legs, arms, back or neck. This can cause problems walking and completing tasks, and even difficulty breathing. Over time, this causes tight joints, shrinking of the muscles (atrophy) or even paralysis. Symptoms may come back years after the original infection, causing the post-polio syndrome.",Diagnosis,The diagnosis can be made based on the symptoms and physical examination when it is known that a person is not immunized and has been to an area where they may have been exposed to the virus. Blood tests for immune proteins which fight the poliovirus (antibodies) and a lumbar puncture (taking a sample of fluid from around the spinal cord) are often done to confirm the diagnosis and to investigate for the virus in the nervous system.,Treatment,"There is no specific cure for poliovirus infection. Treatment aims to relieve symptoms. This may mean simple pain relief for headaches and muscle aches. People with ongoing muscle weakness may need physical therapy to help improve muscle strength.

,,,,,,,,,,What is polycystic ovary syndrome?
,,,,,,,,,,What is polycystic ovary syndrome?,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a condition that affects the normal functioning of a woman’s ovaries. The ovaries usually produce ova (eggs) and the hormones estrogen and progesterone. These hormones influence the menstrual cycle and the production and release of eggs from the ovaries. In healthy women, ovulation occurs every month. At this point, the eggs are released into the fallopian tubes. Before this, these eggs develop tiny cysts within, known as follicles.",Polycystic ovary syndrome is diagnosed if at least two of the following occur:[1],"
A minimum of 12 small cysts (follicles) form in the ovaries. These cysts are not big enough to trigger ovulation.
The balance of the hormones produced in the ovaries is altered, particularly if the amount of testosterone produced increases.
The individual does not ovulate each month or does not ovulate at all. In this case, the affected woman may not have a period.
","In many cases, affected women will experience all three of these effects.","Although PCOS is a relatively common condition, occurring in approximately 5 to 10 percent of women, the exact cause is not known.[2] It is usually diagnosed during adolescence or in young adulthood, and symptoms include irregular or absent periods, excessive hair growth and difficulty falling pregnant.","PCOS is a chronic condition with no cure. After menopause, once ovarian function has declined, the symptoms of the condition will typically improve. Before this, treatment is aimed at managing the signs and symptoms and preventing complications.","Certain lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, are the most typical treatment methods for adolescent girls and women experiencing the condition. Medication is typically reserved for the occurrence of complaints, such as anovulation, hirsutism and menstrual irregularities.",Symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome,Symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome include:[2][3],"
Menstrual irregularity: If ovulation does not occur, women will experience irregular or missed periods.
Weight gain: Approximately half of all women with PCOS will experience weight gain that is difficult to manage.
Unwanted hair growth: Also called hirsutism, affected areas may include the face, arms, chest and back.
Hair loss or thinning: Primarily experienced on the head, normally in middle aged women.
Difficulty becoming pregnant: Some women may find it difficult to fall pregnant and may require fertility treatments.
Acne: Unwanted acne may develop, as well as other skin disorders such as skin tags, darkened patches of skin, oily skin and excessive sweating.
Changeable mood: Some women may experience mood swings, anxiety and/or depression.
Pelvic pain
Headaches
Difficulty sleeping
High blood pressure (hypertension)
Acanthosis nigricans: Brown or grey, velvety and sometimes verrucous patches of hyperpigmented skin. Usually found over the nape of the neck, the vulva, armpit, groin, navel, submammary areas, elbows and knuckles.
","Symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome usually begin to occur around the time of puberty, though some women may only develop symptoms in late adolescence or early adulthood. The symptoms experienced and the severity of these symptoms may also vary from woman to woman.","People experiencing possible symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome should talk to their doctor. In addition, the free Ada app can be used to carry out a symptom assessment.",Causes of polycystic ovary syndrome,"The exact causes of polycystic ovary syndrome are not clear. There are, however, a number of factors which are thought to play a role. These factors include:[1][4]","
Insulin production: Produced in the pancreas, insulin is a hormone with the key function of controlling blood sugar levels. In the ovaries, it also helps to produce the male sex hormone testosterone. Women with PCOS have an insulin resistance, meaning that their bodies are not affected by normal levels of insulin in the usual way. This causes their bodies to produce increased amounts of insulin, resulting in unusually elevated levels of testosterone being present in the ovaries. This testosterone interferes with the ability of the follicles in the ovaries to fully develop.
Luteinising hormone (LH): Produced in the pituitary gland, luteinising hormone works to help the ovaries to ovulate and assists insulin in the production of testosterone. High levels of the hormone are found in roughly half of all women with PCOS.
Weight: Although not a cause of PCOS in itself, being overweight can make insulin resistance worse by causing the the body to produce increased levels of insulin.
Genetic factors: It is thought that there may be a hereditary element to PCOS, but the links between genetics and the development of the condition are not yet fully understood.
",Diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome,"Women experiencing symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome should consult a doctor. A doctor will begin a diagnosis by asking questions about the symptoms and checking blood pressure. Following this, a number of tests can be used to confirm a diagnosis. These include:[1][5]","
Blood tests: Used to measure hormone levels. In women with PCOS, levels of testosterone and luteinising hormone (LH) will typically be elevated.
Ultrasound: Used to scan the ovaries for the small cysts typical of PCOS.
","Before confirming a diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome, doctors will also need to rule out other conditions that may be responsible for the symptoms, such as premature ovarian failure and Cushing’s syndrome.","If a diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome is confirmed, individuals may be referred to a specialist: either a gynecologist – a specialist in the female reproductive system – or an endocrinologist – a specialist in conditions relating to hormones.","Women who display only minor symptoms of PCOS should be carefully monitored by medical professionals. This is because, characteristically, the condition is known to develop and become more serious over time.[2]",Treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome,"There is currently no cure for polycystic ovary syndrome. The aim of treatment, therefore, is to manage the symptoms and reduce the risk of complications developing. Treatment typically involves one or more of the following options, depending on the symptoms experienced and the health of the affected woman:","
Lifestyle changes, particularly weight loss, but also including exercise and the maintenance of a healthy diet
Medications
",Lifestyle changes,Weight loss is considered to be the most effective method of promoting regular periods and lowering the risk of long-term complications as a result of PCOS. Research suggests that losing as little as five percent of body weight can be enough to achieve this.[2][6] Weight loss is best achieved through regular exercise and healthy dietary choices. Women who wish to lose weight should discuss the best ways of achieving this with their doctor.,Medications,"Metformin, though not designed specifically for the treatment of PCOS, may be prescribed by doctors to help treat the condition. Metformin helps the body to become more sensitive to insulin, helping to equalize the balance of hormones in women with a hormone imbalance.[7] Metformin should only be used in cases where lifestyle changes fail to help manage the condition and then should be used in combination with lifestyle changes.","The first line of treatment for women who are infertile but wish to become pregnant is clomifene, a non-steroidal anti-oestrogen medication that helps to increase FSH secretion, which in turn may lead to follicular menstruation and ovulation. Letrozole, a medication not specifically designed to help with ovulation but which, as some research suggests, can be more effective than clomifene, may also be prescribed in some cases.[2]","In women who do not desire to become pregnant, oral contraceptives (OCs, with combined estrogen and progesterone) are commonly prescribed. OCs help to promote regular menstrual periods and can help to reduce excess hair growth and acne.[2]","A hormonal substrate named progestin may also be prescribed to help promote regular periods, though this method does not help with acne or hair growth and does not prevent pregnancy.[2]",Complications of polycystic ovary syndrome,"Women with polycystic ovary syndrome are more likely to develop other conditions, including:[1]","

,,,,,,,,,,What is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)?,"Post-traumatic stress disorder, also known as PTSD and sometimes written as post traumatic stress disorder or posttraumatic stress disorder, is a condition that sometimes develops after a person experiences or witnesses a life-threatening, terrifying or otherwise deeply traumatic event.[1] Examples include:[2][3][4]","
Combat
Natural disasters like floods, fires or earthquakes
Terrorist attacks
Car accidents
Physical or sexual assault
","Experiencing a heart attack[5] or the sudden, unexpected death of a loved one can also lead to PTSD in susceptible people.[1]","After a trauma, it is normal to experience flashbacks, nightmares or intrusive memories. Many people may feel tense, scared or helpless, have difficulty sleeping and struggle to go about their daily activities.","Within a few weeks, however, most people will start to feel better. If symptoms of a stress reaction persist, a person may be diagnosed with PTSD.[2][3][4][1]","While post-traumatic stress disorder can affect people of any age and gender, it seems to be more prevalent among some groups. These include female victims of rape, refugees, firefighters, and teenagers who have experienced car accidents.[6][7]","Generally, the outlook for PTSD is good, and most people will get better even without treatment. However, recovery without treatment may take months or even years. Treatment, which typically involves psychotherapy, sometimes with medication, may help to alleviate the symptoms and shorten the duration of PTSD. In a minority of people, PTSD may become a chronic condition.[2][1][6][7][8]",Acute stress disorder (acute stress reaction),"Most people will experience some of the symptoms present in PTSD soon, days or weeks after a traumatic event. If the symptoms dissipate within a month, the condition is called acute stress disorder (ASD) or acute stress reaction.[1] Treatment, if deemed necessary, may include psychotherapy and a short-term course of beta-blockers, to alleviate some of the physical symptoms, or other appropriate anti-anxiety medication.[9]","Good to know: If symptoms persist for more than 30 days, a diagnosis of PTSD may be considered.[5]",Read more about Acute Stress Disorder »,PTSD symptoms,"Symptoms of PTSD typically present soon after a traumatic event. Sometimes, however, a number of months may pass before symptoms appear.[2][1] Rarely, symptoms of PTSD may first be experienced more than a year after the event.[7]",PTSD symptoms can be divided into four categories. Most people with PTSD will experience symptoms from each of the following categories for longer than one month:[2][1][6][7],"
Re-experiencing (reliving) symptoms. Recurring thoughts, bad memories, nightmares or flashbacks of the trauma. These are distressing.
Avoidance symptoms. Avoiding situations or people that serve as reminders of the trauma or avoiding talking or thinking about it. Some people may spend unusual amounts of time on hobbies or work.[10] Conversely, others may ruminate excessively on the trauma.[7]
Arousal symptoms. Feeling anxious or hyper alert, difficulty concentrating or sleeping, irritability and outbursts of anger, startling easily.
Mood and cognition symptoms. Guilt, shame, negative thoughts, loss of interest in enjoyable activities, feeling that the world is dangerous, feeling numb or detached, difficulty remembering the trauma, derealization (feeling like one’s perceptions are not real),[11] an inability to feel optimistic, happy or loving.
",Physical symptoms of PTSD may also be present. These can include:,"
Muscle pain
Diarrhea
An irregular heartbeat
Headaches
",Some people experiencing PTSD may also act recklessly or impulsively[12] or abuse alcohol or drugs.[10],"Good to know: If any symptoms have been present for longer than four weeks, are causing serious distress or are interfering with daily life, it is advisable to see a healthcare practitioner without delay.[2]","If you think that you might have signs of PTSD, try using the Ada app to find out more about your symptoms.",PTSD causes,Post-traumatic stress disorder can develop after a person of any age experiences or witnesses a deeply traumatic event – often one that is life-threatening or perceived as life-threatening. Examples include:[6][7][11],"
Natural disasters
Serious accidents
Sexual assault and other severe types of assault
Combat
Mass conflict
Torture
Terrorist attacks
Seeing someone being killed
","Domestic violence, heart attacks, strokes, severe injury, sudden severe illness, hospitalization in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and the sudden, unexpected death of a loved one may also lead to PTSD.[1][7][5] Less severe, but still serious traumatic events may also cause PTSD-like symptoms in certain people.[6]",Good to know: Seeing a traumatic event on television or in other media is not typically considered a trigger for PTSD.[5][12],PTSD Risk factors,Not everyone who experiences trauma will go on to experience PTSD. A number of factors may increase the risk of a person developing the condition. These include:[6][5][11],"
Being female
Being in a racial or ethnic minority[6][13]
Low levels of education
Low socioeconomic status
Being separated, divorced or widowed
Childhood abuse or adversity
Previous exposure to trauma
Personal or family history of mental health conditions
Severe additional stress after the trauma[1]
Lack of social support
Severity of initial reaction to the trauma
","In addition, certain types of trauma are thought to be more likely to lead to PTSD than others. These include traumatic events that are:[10]","
Sudden and unexpected
Continue for a long time
Allow no means of escape
Are man-made
Cause mutilation or multiple deaths
Involve children
",Certain people are considered to be at higher risk than the general population of developing PTSD. These include:[6][7],"
Female victims of rape
Refugees
Asylum seekers
Emergency response workers such as the police, firefighters and paramedics
",Military service,Soldiers and other members of the military may also have an increased risk of PTSD. The following factors are thought to contribute to the development of PTSD in military personnel:[7][5],"
Having a combat role in war
Severe injury during combat, especially traumatic brain injury
Serious accidents
Low rank
Low morale
Low education
Leaving the service
Lack of social support
Being unmarried
Childhood adversity
",Diagnosis of PTSD,"After taking a person’s history and performing a physical examination, a healthcare practitioner will typically diagnose post-traumatic stress disorder using the following criteria:[1][5][12]","
Exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury or sexual violence. This may involve direct experience of a traumatic event, witnessing an event, a close relative or friend directly experiencing an event, or exposure to traumatic events as part of one’s job.
One or more intrusive, re-experiencing symptoms. This may involve recurrent distressing memories, nightmares, flashbacks or distress, when reminded of the trauma.
One or more avoidance symptoms. This may involve avoiding people, places and other external triggers that may remind one of the trauma or trying to avoid thinking about it.
Two or more arousal symptoms. These may include irritability and angry outbursts, reckless behavior, feeling hyper alert, startling easily, difficulty concentrating or sleep disturbances.
Two or more mood and cognition symptoms. These may include inability to remember the trauma or aspects thereof, negative thoughts about oneself or the world, guilt, shame or other negative emotions, loss of interest in enjoyable activities, detachment or an inability to feel positive emotions like happiness or love.
","For a diagnosis of PTSD to be made, the symptoms should first appear after a traumatic event, persist for longer than a month, cause significant distress or marked difficulty in social and job situations and not be caused by substance abuse or another health condition.[5]",The above criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD apply to anyone older than six. Diagnosis of PTSD in children younger than six may be based on different criteria (see the section titled PTSD in children below).,PTSD treatment,"A number of effective treatments are available for post-traumatic stress disorder. The primary treatment is psychotherapy, which is sometimes combined with medication.[3]","If symptoms of PTSD are mild and less than a month has passed since the traumatic event, a diagnosis of ASD may be made and the condition managed accordingly. However, where symptoms are moderate or severe and persist, one or more of the types of treatment below will typically be recommended.[6][7]",Psychotherapy,"While various types of psychotherapy exist, the following are considered to be most effective and are often recommended for the treatment of PTSD:","
Exposure therapy. This type of therapy allows people to confront their trauma in a safe, guided manner so that it can be processed emotionally, thereby lessening distress.[14]
Trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TFCBT). This type of therapy helps people to identify and change unhelpful thought patterns and behaviors related to the trauma, thereby aiding recovery. Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) is a type of TFCBT that is widely used in the treatment of PTSD.[6][7][14]
Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR). A form of CBT that uses specific eye movements to help ease distress from trauma.[6][7][14]
","Depending on the individual, group therapy, mindfulness-based stress reduction and other types of therapeutic intervention may also be considered.[6][10][14]",Medication,"If psychotherapy alone does not seem to be adequate for a person affected by PTSD, medication may be prescribed. PTSD medication may include:","
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). These antidepressants may reduce the symptoms of PTSD by acting on chemicals in the brain. SSRIs typically require 2-4 weeks to start working and are taken for a number of months. Examples of SSRIs prescribed for PTSD include fluoxetine, paroxetine and sertraline.[6][7][10][15]
Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Similar to SSRIs, these antidepressants may reduce the symptoms of PTSD by altering chemicals in the brain. Venlafaxine is the SNRI typically prescribed for PTSD.[6][7][15]
Other antidepressants. There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and other types of antidepressants in the treatment of PTSD.[15] However, these may be prescribed at the discretion of a doctor in certain situations.
Anti-anxiety medication. Benzodiazepines like diazepam are sometimes prescribed to reduce the symptoms of anxiety, over-alertness and sleep disturbances in PTSD. However, because they are highly addictive, they should not be used for longer than a week or two.[6][10][15]
","Where treatment with an SSRI or SNRI is not effective or sufficient, other medications may occasionally be recommended. These include antipsychotics like quetiapine and risperidone, as well as other medications like clonidine and prazosin, which are sometimes used in the management of anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and PTSD (though their efficacy in the treatment of PTSD require more research).[7][15]",Other remedies,"Though evidence of effectiveness is lacking, some people may find the following to be helpful as part of their treatment of PTSD:[10][11][16]","
Mindfulness and meditation practices
Yoga
Acupuncture
Massage
Service animals such as dogs
Support groups[6]
",Prevention of PTSD,"While it may not be possible to prevent the development of PTSD, the following interventions may be helpful:","
Support from family and friends. This may help a person to recover after a traumatic event.[3]
Minimizing stress. Trying to avoid other sources of stress as much as possible may also aid recovery after a traumatic event.[3]
Psychotherapy. Multiple (4-12) sessions of trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TFCBT) or certain other types of therapy may help people affected by PTSD to manage the condition. Single counseling sessions may do more harm than good.[13]
Medication. Early studies suggest that prompt treatment with hydrocortisone after exposure to a traumatic event may reduce the likelihood of developing PTSD. However, more research is needed.[13] Clonidine is another possible medication with this effect that requires more research.[6]
","In addition, post-deployment support may be useful for members of the military who have been involved in combat situations.","Screening may be helpful for people who have experienced natural disasters, as well as for asylum seekers and refugees, as they are considered to have a relatively high risk of developing PTSD. Treatment can then be recommended where necessary.[6][7]",Related health complications of PTSD,PTSD is associated with a number of possible physical and mental health complications.,Physical complications,"People with post-traumatic stress disorder seem to have a higher risk of developing a range of physical health conditions. These include muscle, joint and nerve pain; stomach and intestinal issues and problems with the heart and lungs.[7]",Mental health complications,PTSD often seems to occur with other mental health conditions like depression or anxiety. There also appears to be a high rate of substance abuse among people with PTSD.[1][6][7][12],"People affected by PTSD may have an increased risk of suicide.[17] If someone shows signs of crisis, it is essential to contact a suicide prevention lifeline or emergency services without delay.",Other complications,"PTSD may also cause difficulties in relationships with partners, friends and family. A person with PTSD may experience challenges with trust, intimacy, communication and problem-solving.[4] Therapy may be recommended to help with this.","In some cases, PTSD may become a chronic condition that lasts years. However, research suggests that Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) may be effective in treating even complicated cases of long duration.[7][12]",Complex PTSD,"Complex PTSD has been proposed as a separate diagnosis for the symptoms that result from long-term, chronic, trauma such as ongoing domestic abuse. People who have been exposed to trauma of an extended duration may experience additional symptoms to those commonly reported in PTSD – one example being changes in identity.[12][18]","While complex PTSD is not medically accepted as a separate diagnosis to PTSD, there seems to be an understanding that cases of prolonged trauma may require specialized treatment approaches.[12][18]",PTSD in children,"While people of any age can develop PTSD after a traumatic event, the symptoms may be different in children – particularly those who are very young.[19]",Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder in children,"PTSD symptoms vary from child to child. While some of the symptoms may be the same as those experienced by adults, in children the following may also be present:[19][20]","
Repeated re-enactment of the traumatic event while playing
Mixing up the order of the traumatic event
False identification of signs predicting the trauma and belief that future trauma can be prevented by monitoring for similar signs
Nightmares that are not obviously about the trauma
Fear of sleeping alone

",Diagnosis,"The criteria outlined above are used to diagnose PTSD in anyone over the age of six. In younger children, the following criteria are typically used:[19]","
Exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury or sexual violence. This may involve direct experience of a traumatic event, witnessing an event or a caregiver directly experiencing an event.
One or more intrusive (re-experiencing) symptom. This may involve recurrent, distressing memories of the event, these may be expressed as repeated re-enactment of the trauma through play, or sometimes drawing, which does not always seem upsetting to the child,[22] nightmares not necessarily specific to the trauma, flashbacks or visible distress when reminded of the trauma.
One or more avoidance or mood and cognition symptom. This may involve attempting to avoid people, places and other external triggers that may remind the child of the trauma, more frequent negative moods, e.g. noticeable guilt, shame, sadness or similar emotions, loss of interest in enjoyable activities such as playing, being withdrawn or reduced expression of positive emotions like happiness or love.
Two or more arousal symptoms. These may include irritability and angry outbursts (including tantrums), being hypervigilant, startling easily or being difficult to calm,[23] difficulty concentrating or sleep disturbances.
","Additional indications of PTSD in young children may include a sudden regression in developmental skills, e.g. bedwetting, thumb-sucking, making baby-talk,[24][25] the appearance of new or old fears, unexplained accidents, behaving recklessly, separation anxiety, e.g. clinging to a caregiver, and the reporting of physical ailments like stomachaches and headaches. Children may also become hyperactive and seem easily distracted.[26]","For a diagnosis of PTSD to be made, the symptoms should first appear after a traumatic event, persist for longer than a month, cause significant distress or marked difficulty at school or in relationships with caregivers, siblings or peers, and not be caused by a substance or another health condition.[19]","Caregivers are advised to monitor for significant changes in a child’s behavior, play and sleep patterns and consult with a child healthcare specialist, should anything seem amiss.",Treatment,"Children and teenagers affected by PTSD are typically treated in the same way as adults. Trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TFCBT), sometimes in combination with medication, may be recommended.[21][20]",Prevention,"While it may not be possible to prevent PTSD in children, steps can be taken to minimize the risk of them developing the condition. These include:[21]","
Teaching children to say no to anyone who threatens them or makes them feel uncomfortable.
Ensuring that they have access to appropriate support in the event that they experience trauma.
",Post-traumatic stress disorder FAQs,"Q: Is it possible to develop PTSD from a relationship?

,,,,,,,,,,What is post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis?
,,,,,,,,,,What is post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis?,Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis is a disease of the kidneys which occurs after infection with a bacteria called Streptococcus. Streptococcal bacteria most commonly cause infections of the tonsils and skin.,"This condition tends to affect children between the ages of 5 and 12 and adults older than 60. The symptoms are swelling of the legs, hands and face and blood in the urine. Most people also develop high blood pressure. Often there is no specific treatment for this condition, but the infection should be treated and measures may be needed to support the kidneys while they recover. Children usually recover very well from this condition within 6 to 8 weeks. Adults are more likely to develop complications, including high blood pressure and kidney damage.",Symptoms,"The symptoms of this condition may vary in severity from person to person. The most common symptoms are red or brown urine and swelling of the feet and legs. People with this condition also develop high blood pressure, but this usually has no symptoms.",Read more about Signs of High Blood Pressure »,"These symptoms may be accompanied by other complaints such as flank (side) pain, a feeling of weakness, and passing only small amounts of urine. Some people may become short of breath or develop a cough. Symptoms start within 3 weeks after a bacterial infection.","If you are experiencing possible symptoms of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, try using the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.",Causes,"The kidneys are two organs that sit underneath the ribs in the back and which are responsible for filtering toxins from the blood and maintaining the balance of fluid and electrolytes. If the small filtration units of the kidney (the glomeruli) become inflamed and swollen, this is called glomerulonephritis. There are several possible causes, including autoimmune conditions (when the immune system begins to mistakenly attack the healthy body tissues), following an infection, and some medical conditions, including diabetes and some cancers.","Glomerulonephritis following an infection with the Streptococcus bacteria is one of the most common causes of kidney disease in children worldwide, although it is uncommon in countries with good access to health care. The Streptococcus most commonly causes tonsillitis and skin infections. It is thought that this causes glomerulonephritis because the immune system mistakes the kidney cells for the Streptococcal bacteria. This condition is most common in children between the ages of 5 and 12 years and adults older than 60. It tends to affects males and females equally.",Diagnosis,"The diagnosis may be suspected based on the symptoms and physical examination in a person who has recently been unwell with a bacterial infection. Blood and urine tests help to confirm the diagnosis, and are necessary for monitoring the kidney function and recovery. An ultrasound of the kidneys is often performed as well. If the diagnosis is uncertain, a small sample of the kidney may need to be taken (a biopsy) and investigated for the cause of the kidney problems.",Treatment,"Treatment of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis usually involves treating the bacterial infection (if necessary), monitoring and supporting kidney function and treating the symptoms. There is no specific treatment for this condition. Management may involve using diuretic medications to reduce the amount of fluid in the body, and medications to reduce blood pressure.

,,,,,,,,,,What is preeclampsia
,,,,,,,,,,What is preeclampsia,"Preeclampsia, also spelled pre-eclampsia and formerly sometimes called toxemia, is a potentially serious condition that affects only pregnant women after the 20th week of pregnancy or shortly after delivery.[1] Its characteristic symptoms are sudden-onset proteinuria (protein in the urine) and hypertension (high blood pressure). It is not yet known for certain what causes preeclampsia, but it may have something to do with abnormalities of the placental blood supply. Preeclampsia may also occur alongside HELLP syndrome, which is very serious and may progress to eclampsia, which is also very serious and may be fatal.","Preeclampsia affects only between about two and eight of every 100 pregnant women.[2] Severe preeclampsia affects only about one in every 200 pregnancies. HELLP Syndrome has a similar incidence, but around half of women with severe preeclampsia will develop HELLP Syndrome. Rates of eclampsia are low in most developed countries, with an incidence of around one in every 2000 pregnancies. However, the rate is considerably higher in developing countries.[3]",Signs and symptoms of preeclampsia,Preeclampsia is often diagnosed during a routine visit to the doctor. The early signs of preeclampsia include:[1][4],"
Hypertension (high blood pressure). A blood pressure of 140 over 90 is considered a sign in women who do not have pre-existing hypertension.
Proteinuria (protein in the urine). This is defined as 300mg or more of protein passed in the urine over 24 hours.
","Foamy urine is a sign of proteinuria. If a pregnant woman finds that her urine is foamy, she should consult a physician as soon as possible. Other symptoms which may appear as the disorder worsens include:[1][2][4][5][6]","
Headache that cannot be alleviated with painkillers
Edema (swelling) of hands, arms, face and/or feet
Blurred vision or blind spots
Confusion or disorientation
Nausea and vomiting
Pain in the upper right abdomen, just below the ribs or behind the breastbone
A pain feeling like heartburn that cannot be alleviated by antacids
Feeling of great unwellness
Oliguria (low urine output) of 500ml or less over 24 hours
Being unable to feel the baby move as much as previously
Shortness of breath, possibly due to pulmonary edema (excess fluid in the lungs)
Stroke. This is very rare
","Good to know: If a pregnant person suddenly discovers that their watch, bracelets or rings no longer fit their arm or hand, or that their sleeves are suddenly tight, they should seek medical help immediately.",Good to knowA sensation that feels like heartburn is also quite a common symptom among pregnant women who do not have preeclampsia. The feeling of heartburn resulting from preeclampsia can be distinguished from real heartburn by its resistance to antacid treatment.[2][7],"Good to know: It should be noted that not all painkillers are safe for use in pregnancy. Pregnant women should consult with their doctor about what pain-relieving measures might work for them. If a pregnant woman has a headache that does not resolve on its own within a reasonable time, they should contact their care provider.","If any of these symptoms appear, the affected person should receive medical help as soon as possible. Without treatment, preeclampsia may become eclampsia, which is very serious and may be in rarer cases even be fatal. This is very rarely the case in developed countries, however, and adequate prenatal care may make it even less likely.  [8]  If you are unsure about whether or not you or a loved one may have preeclampsia, you can check your symptoms for free with Ada app.",Hypertension and proteinuria in preeclampsia,"Many women have hypertension during pregnancy, without having preeclampsia. Hypertension that results from preeclampsia is normally distinguishable from pre-existing or chronic hypertension by its sudden onset.[4] Hypertension during pregnancy is also believed to be influenced by low magnesium intake, as well as other factors, and low calcium intake leading to low levels of calcium in the body.[9] Diets with a high calorie intake may also play a role.",It is possible for preeclampsia-related hypertension to happen at the same time as  chronic hypertension. It may be quite difficult to diagnose preeclampsia in women with chronic hypertension.[10],It may be hard to diagnose preeclampsia-related proteinuria accurately in women with pre-existing proteinuria or renal diseases. One indication that preeclampsia-related proteinuria is present may be a sudden upward spike in the levels of protein being excreted.,"In all of these cases, if proteinuria is present, preeclampsia is also likely to be present.",Preeclampsia headache: what does a preeclampsia headache feel like?,"The headache that accompanies preeclampsia is often described as dull and throbbing and has also been described as migraine-like.[7] Importantly, it does not respond to commonly used over-the-counter painkillers.","Good to know: It is believed that there is a link between headaches in general and migraine headaches in particular and the risk of experiencing preeclampsia.[11] Some studies have found that women with a pre-pregnancy history of migraine headaches may have a higher risk of developing preeclampsia.[11][12]
If you are concerned that your headache might be related to preeclampsia, or if you are experiencing other symptoms, start a symptom assessment.",Blurred vision and visual disturbances in preeclampsia,"About a quarter of women with severe preeclampsia and up to half of all women with eclampsia (see below) report visual problems, especially blurred vision.[13] Preeclampsia can cause eye problems such as:[13][14]","
Hypertensive retinopathy, caused by high blood pressure damaging the retina or the eye
Exudative retinal detachment, caused by inflammation causing fluid to build up under the retina
Cortical blindness, caused by problems with the brain’s occipital cortex, which controls vision
",Types of visual disturbances caused by preeclampsia include:[13][14],"
Blurred vision
Flashes of light
Difficulty focusing or sudden/rapidly-developing inability to focus
Blind spots
Double vision
Loss of vision in one or both eyes
",Good to know: Visual symptoms resulting from preeclampsia are usually not permanent but transitory. Permanent vision problems as a result of preeclampsia are rare.,Abdominal pain in preeclampsia,"Abdominal pain is a common symptom of preeclampsia. It is classically felt in the upper-right abdomen, below the ribs – roughly where the liver is located, but can often also be felt below the breastbone, a region known as the epigastrium, and may at times also radiate towards the right hand side of the back.[15]","There is some evidence that severe upper-right abdominal pain in  pregnant women indicates that the the liver has been affected,[16] which increases the risk of HELLP Syndrome developing.[17] Severe upper-right abdominal pain is an important sign that HELLP Syndrome may be developing.  If a pregnant person develops upper-right abdominal pain, they should contact their physicians as soon as possible.",Concerned about the abdominal pain that you or a loved one are experiencing? Check your symptoms with Ada.,Signs and symptoms of severe preeclampsia,Most women with preeclampsia will not go on to develop severe preeclampsia if they are promptly treated. Signs and symptoms which can indicate severe preeclampsia include:[4],"
Worsening physical symptoms, as listed above
Renal insufficiency due to kidney damage from high blood pressure
Moderate to severe thrombocytopenia,  i.e.low platelet count of 100 000 or lower
Twice the normal serum levels of aspartate transaminase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (enzymes found in the liver)
","In mothers with severe preeclampsia, the unborn baby usually suffers from reduced oxygen and nutrient supply, which can retard fetal growth. Babies can be measured by medical practitioners to determine whether they are small for gestational age.",Causes of preeclampsia and subsequent eclampsia,"The cause of preeclampsia is not yet completely understood by doctors. It appears to involve inflammation of maternal blood vessels, particularly those in the kidneys. This may be due to abnormalities in the way that the placental blood supply develops, which can impact the effectiveness of the attachment of the placenta to the uterine wall.[3] An imperfect attachment may cause inflammatory substances to be released into the mother’s bloodstream. It is not yet known whether preeclampsia is caused by these abnormalities or whether these abnormalities and preeclampsia share a cause.","There is some evidence that preeclampsia and heart disease share some risk factors, namely:[18]","
Endothelial dysfunction (dysfunction of the lining of the blood vessels and lymph glands)
Obesity
Hypertension
Hyperglycemia
Insulin resistance
Dyslipidemia (high levels of lipids in the blood).
","There also appears to be a genetic component that determines a person’s risk of developing preeclampsia. If a pregnant person’s mother and/or sisters have a history of preeclampsia, their risk of preeclampsia is higher than that of a person without such a family history. Having had a previous pregnancy with preeclampsia also increases risk.[19] In such high-risk pregnancies, there is some evidence that a daily low dose (81mg/day) of aspirin may have a protective effect.[20]","While the cause is uncertain, the risk factors for preeclampsia are well-known. Risk of preeclampsia is higher in women who:[1][2][4]","
Have diabetes (type 1, type 2 or gestational diabetes)
Are pregnant for the first time
Are pregnant for the first time in 10 years
Are having a multiple pregnancy of twins, triplets, etc.
Have a BMI of 35 or greater, or body weight of 90kg or greater
Are older than 40 or younger than 17 years old
Have existing high blood pressure
Have existing kidney disease
Have existing vascular disorders
Have existing clotting disorders
Have a history of preeclampsia
Have a family history of preeclampsia
","If you are worried you may have preeclampsia, start a symptom assessment.",Preeclampsia and diet,"Preeclampsia is slightly more common among pregnant women from poorer communities, which may suggest that there is a connection between nutrition and preeclampsia. However, this theory has not been properly tested. A related theory is that overnutrition, especially obesity before and during pregnancy, as well as undernutrition, can both cause the risk of preeclampsia to rise. It has been suggested that low-protein diets, low-fat diets and low-energy diets may affect preeclampsia. Again, however, these hypotheses have not been proven.[21]","There is some evidence that preeclampsia and atherosclerosis share risk factors, including:[21]","
Obesity
Insulin resistance, a condition associated with type 2 diabetes, where the body does not respond to the hormone insulin, leading to high blood glucose levels
Thrombophilia, a condition causing blood clots to form
Hyperhomocysteinemia, abnormally high levels of the amino acid homocysteine in the blood
African heritage
","The link appears to be that both conditions increase the number of oxidants in the body. Some studies have therefore suggested that antioxidants such as Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, or a Vitamin E-related compound such as tocopherol may be helpful in reducing the risk of preeclampsia. However, trials to test the efficacy of supplementing the diet of pregnant women with antioxidants like Vitamins E and C to help reduce the risk of preeclampsia have been inconclusive.[22] It is also possible that taking antioxidants as supplements might have a different effect to absorbing antioxidants through food. This theory is yet to be fully proven.[21]",Diets for preeclampsia,"The only things that are proven to have a positive effect on reducing the risk of preeclampsia are calcium supplements and low-dose aspirin.. A diet high in fruit and vegetables is also known to have a beneficial effect on overall health among pregnant women, therefore reducing the risk of conditions that increase the risk of preeclampsia. Lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking and cutting out alcohol can also help.","It is important to note that calcium supplementation to prevent preeclampsia is only effective in women who have low calcium intake in their diets: it does not make a difference if the pregnant person’s diet already had adequate calcium.[21] If a pregnant person is concerned that they may have low calcium, they can ask their doctor to run a test.","Omega-3 supplementation may have a protective effect against preeclampsia, but this is not known for sure. It was also formerly thought that sodium (salt) intake should be restricted to prevent preeclampsia, and, while a low-salt diet will reduce the risk of hypertension, it should not be done if it affects adequate intake of protein, calcium and energy.[21]",Good to know: It is not safe for a pregnant person to begin to take unprescribed supplements or to make any significant modifications to their diets without consulting with their pregnancy care team first.,Good to know: Nobody is as yet certain whether diet can increase someone’s risk of developing preeclampsia or whether there is a way to reduce the risk of preeclampsia  significantly by following a particular diet.[21] A diet however that may lead to substantial weight gain or obesity may increase risk and should therefore not be followed.,Pregnant women should not modify their diets or begin dietary supplementation without consulting their OB-GYN team or primary physician.,Complications of preeclampsia,"Most cases of preeclampsia are relatively mild and can be treated without much danger to the mother or the unborn baby. However, in some cases the situation can become more severe. HELLP Syndrome and eclampsia are two serious complications of eclampsia.",HELLP syndrome,"HELLP syndrome may be considered a very severe form of preeclampsia, or a separate but overlapping disorder. The acronym HELLP stands for “hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count”, which refer to the main features of the condition.[2] HELLP tends to have sudden onset with similar symptoms to preeclampsia.","Good to know: HELLP Syndrome is very rare, affecting only between 4% and 12% of all women with preeclampsia.[23]",Signs and symptoms that may be immediately apparent include:[2][3],"
Nausea and vomiting
Pain in the upper abdominal (stomach) region
Headache
Vision problems
Bruising easily or purple spots on the skin
Tender or swollen liver
High blood pressure
","If you are concerned that you or a loved one may have HELLP Syndrome or preeclampsia, you can start a free Ada symptom assessment now.",Signs that can be determined only by testing include:[2],"
Proteinuria
Hemolysis (disintegrating blood cells)
Raised enzyme levels
Thrombocytopenia (low blood platelet count)
","HELLP Syndrome can occur at any point after 20 weeks of pregnancy, but is most common between 27 and 37 weeks. However, between 15 % to 30 % of  of cases of HELLP Syndrome occur only after delivery. Long-term complications can include:[3]","
Retarded fetal growth
Placental abruption, i.e. separation of placenta from uterine wall before labor
Blood clotting problems
Eclampsia, i.e. seizures in pregnant women with high blood pressure
Liver failure
","Placental abruption can reduce the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the unborn baby, increasing the risk of retarded fetal growth. In severe cases, the unborn child may not survive.[24]",Eclampsia,"Eclampsia is a very serious complication of pregnancy and must be treated rapidly.[25] Despite advances in medical care, eclampsia is still a leading cause of maternal mortality.[26]","Eclampsia is diagnosed when a pregnant person with preeclampsia begins to have seizures.[27]. In most cases, the person with eclampsia will have shown symptoms of severe preeclampsia, but in some cases no prior symptoms of preeclampsia appear. If eclampsia is not treated rapidly, it can lead to maternal coma, brain damage, and death.[28] Worried about these or other symptoms? Get your personal Ada health assessment now.",Treatment and care,"Deciding which treatment option for preeclampsia is best involves balancing the severity of the preeclampsia with the risks facing the baby. The only total cure for preeclampsia is to deliver the baby and placenta.  If it is safe to do so for both the mother and the baby, the pregnancy will be maintained until the natural end of gestation, around 37 weeks. Only if the life of the mother or the baby is in danger will labor be induced early. However, if the baby is still too young to survive outside the womb, the medical care team will take steps to maintain the pregnancy until it is safe to deliver, if it is safe for the mother to do so.","In cases of mild preeclampsia, a short period of initial hospitalization may be followed by home care as an outpatient, often extending until the baby is delivered. Home care includes:[4]","
Bed rest
Regular blood pressure tests
Regular fetal nonstress tests (NSTs) to check on the baby’s health
Visits to a physician two or three times a week
","It can also be helpful to increase the amount of protein eaten, minimize salt intake and ensure that enough water is consumed to stay well-hydrated.[29]",Hospitalization for preeclampsia,"When home care is not advisable due to the severity of the symptoms, women with preeclampsia will usually be hospitalized. The treatment concentrates on managing hypertension and monitoring for complications. Treatment includes:[2][30][10]","
Medication to lower blood pressure, such as hydralazine, labetalol and nifedipine
Blood pressure tests at intervals of four hours, or, in severe cases, every 15 to 30 minutes
Urine tests for protein
Monitoring of hydration
Blood tests to monitor platelet count, clotting factors, and kidney and liver function
","If preeclampsia occurs in late pregnancy, labor may be induced if the baby or the mother have blood pressure levels that cannot be controlled until the baby comes to full term.  In such cases, the baby may be delivered, vaginally or by cesarean section.In cases where the baby is only a few weeks premature, the risks to the baby’s health are low. However, if the baby is less than 34 weeks along, it is the severity of the mother’s preeclampsia that will determine whether the medical team opts to deliver the baby.[2] Outcomes for the baby may improve if the pregnancy is maintained, but treatment should not be at the expense of maternal wellbeing.","In some cases, corticosteroids may be administered to boost the baby’s lung development in order to allow it to be safely delivered earlier.[28] If corticosteroid treatment is undertaken, the baby’s heart rate should be monitored very closely.[31] If they are not thriving in the womb and have a better chance of survival if delivered, labor should be induced.","If HELLP syndrome is present, delivery will be induced regardless.[30]","In cases of eclampsia, also, delivery should not be postponed unless the mother is in an unstable condition, in which case the mother should be stabilized before delivery is attempted. This should be done regardless of whether or not the baby is distressed.[10]","In cases of eclampsia, the mother’s oxygen intake and seizures should be brought under control before delivery. Both baby and mother will need to be in a high-dependency unit for at least 24 hours after birth.[10] Seizures can be prevented with an intravenous dose of magnesium sulfate, and may be broken using lorazepam or diazepam.[32] Magnesium sulfate can have serious side effects and should only be administered by a skilled practitioner.",Preeclampsia after delivery,"Most instances of preeclampsia happen before the baby is born, and subside soon after delivery. However, in a minority of cases, preeclampsia occurs only after delivery. If this happens, the affected person will be placed in a hospital high-dependency unit and monitored for signs of eclampsia. Once the medical team has established that they are not at risk of eclampsia, they will remain in hospital to be monitored for hypertension and further complications.[2]","Good to know: In cases of postpartum preeclampsia, the baby is likely to be unaffected.",FAQs,"Q:What are the long-term complications for women who have had preeclampsia?
A: There is some evidence that women who had preeclampsia, eclampsia or HELLP syndrome may be at increased risk of hypertension and heart disease in later life.[10] It may also increase the risk of stroke.","Q: Will my preeclampsia have long-term effects on my child once they are born?
A: Children born to mothers with preeclampsia may be at increased risk of endocrine and nutritional diseases,[33] which can affect height and weight gain.[34]","Q: Does low-dose aspirin help prevent preeclampsia?
A: There is some evidence that aspirin in low doses can have a protective effect against preeclampsia in women who are at high risk of the condition, especially those who have had preeclampsia in a previous pregnancy. The dosage range is between 75mg and 150mg a day. It’s not clear whether it’s safe to take higher doses during pregnancy. Do not begin taking aspirin without consulting a doctor."
,,,,,,,,,,What is pregnancy?
,,,,,,,,,,What is pregnancy?,"Pregnancy is the term used to describe the fertilization of a human egg and the carrying of a baby in the womb. To get pregnant it is necessary that semen gets in contact with a human egg. This may happen during sexual intercourse or through other methods, such as in vitro fertilization (IVF). Early symptoms of pregnancy include missing a period, tiredness, nausea with vomiting and breast tenderness. Pregnant women should visit their doctor regularly to check-up on the health of both the mother and growing child.",Risks,"For pregnancy to occur, a human egg and sperm need to meet under conditions that are favorable for pregnancy. The chances of pregnancy are higher when contraception is not used and when sexual intercourse occurs around the time of ovulation.",Symptoms,"Typical early symptoms of pregnancy include missing a period, tiredness, nausea with vomiting and breast tenderness. Later symptoms of pregnancy include a brown rash on the face, swollen feet and ankles, urinating more frequently and, eventually, weight gain and widening around the belly. Symptoms in pregnancy are the result of the hormonal and physical changes that occur in a woman's body which help to support the child as it grows.",Diagnosis,Diagnosis usually is made by a pregnancy test. Pregnancy tests test for a hormone called beta-hCG in urine or blood. Beta-hCG is produced by the embryo (the baby in the first days and weeks of life). Beta-hCG can be detected 8 to 11 days after conception.,Treatment,"Pregnant women should visit their doctor regularly to check-up on the health of both the mother and foetus. Complications which occur during pregnancy, such as high blood pressure or diabetes, may need medical treatment.",Prevention,"Prevention can be achieved by contraception (birth control). There are many different types of conception, and it is helpful to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different methods with a family doctor or gynecologist. Popular options are condoms, the oral contraceptive pill (the pill), depo-provera (injections) and intrauterine coils (a copper coil which sits inside the womb). It is also possible to tie or cut the fallopian tubes (in women) or the ductus deferens (the sperm duct in men) to prevent any future pregnancy. These are minor surgical procedures and are permanent.",Other names for pregnancy,"

,,,,,,,,,,What are pregnancy complications?
,,,,,,,,,,What are pregnancy complications?,"Pregnancy complications are health problems that occur during pregnancy, and which affect the mother, the baby or both. The majority of pregnancies proceed normally without any health issues, but it is important, even for very healthy women, to be aware of possible complications. Familiarity with possible kinds of pregnancy complications and their symptoms will contribute to the likelihood of a healthy pregnancy by enabling the expectant parent to:","
Ensure that any necessary preventive measures are taken
Identify potential complications  early enough to treat them successfully
Receive appropriate healthcare support should it be needed
","This will increase the possibility of preventing pregnancy complications that do occur resulting in adverse outcomes, such as miscarriage.","The following overview of possible pregnancy complications includes some of the most common pregnancy complications, including:","
Infections that may develop during pregnancy
Non-infectious conditions, possibly pre-existing, which can present complications during pregnancy
Complications that are specific to pregnancy
",Infections during pregnancy,"During pregnancy, women are more susceptible to certain infections and the complications of certain infections. Some infections may also affect the healthy development of the baby.",Chickenpox during pregnancy,"The likelihood of developing chickenpox during pregnancy is relatively low, and women who do contract chickenpox are unlikely to experience serious complications. However, in some cases, chickenpox during pregnancy can cause complications for the mother and baby and be potentially life threatening.[1]",Contact a doctor or midwife in the following situations:,"
Chickenpox is contracted, or there is a suspicion of the condition
The mother has never had chickenpox and never been near anyone with chickenpox, even if there are no symptoms present
",Food poisoning during pregnancy,"Pregnant women are more likely to develop food poisoning. In most cases, a bout of food poisoning will be unpleasant for the mother, but will not affect the health of the baby. However, food poisoning can affect the baby, especially if the infection is a result of types of bacteria called listeria, which causes listeriosis, or the toxoplasma gondii parasite, which causes toxoplasmosis.","Listeriosis is a bacterial infection, often found in unpasteurised dairy products, such as milk and soft cheeses, as well as raw and cured (deli) meats. It is important to avoid these foods during pregnancy and to contact one’s doctor or midwife at the first sign of infection, which may include nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea and/or aches and pains. Diagnosis will be made with a blood test, after which a course of antibiotic treatment will usually be prescribed to prevent possible pregnancy complications. Pregnant women are particularly susceptible to Listeria infection in their third trimester.[2]","Toxoplasmosis is a parasite infection, often found in raw or undercooked meat, cat feces and contaminated soil. If a pregnant woman develops toxoplasmosis, this can pose serious health risks for the baby, including miscarriage and stillbirth.[3] The likelihood of contracting toxoplasmosis during pregnancy is thought to be very small, but pregnant women should nonetheless take care to wash their hands thoroughly with antibacterial soap and water after touching soil, for example, after gardening, and avoid undercooked meat, raw shellfish, unfiltered water and possibly contaminated fruits and vegetables. It would also be prudent to ask another person to change the cat litter box, should this be necessary. Preventive measures are the most appropriate in combating toxoplasmosis.[4] A pregnant woman may develop no symptoms at all as a result of toxoplasmosis or may feel generally unwell and develop swollen glands.[5] If there is any concern that a pregnant woman may have contracted the infection, even when no symptoms are present, urgent medical attention should be sought.","Contact a doctor or midwife in the following situations, which may relate to food poisoning:[3]","
The mother feels very unwell, particularly if there is severe stomach pain
There is a fever
Diarrhea lasts for longer than three days
Vomiting is continuous
The mother cannot keep fluids down
There is blood in the mother’s stool
There is bleeding from the vagina
","For more information about avoiding food poisoning, consult these resources on foods to eat during pregnancy and foods to avoid during pregnancy.",Flu during pregnancy,"The chances of complications are higher for women who contract the flu during pregnancy, but for most, these will not be serious. In some cases, these complications can affect the baby’s health. If you are concerned that you may be developing the flu during pregnancy, get a personal health assessment from the Ada app.  A doctor should be consulted if flu-like symptoms are present.",Pregnant women are advised to have the flu vaccine to lower the chances of contracting the viral infection. Other preventive measures – such as avoiding contact with people with the flu and washing the hands regularly – should also be taken throughout the course of the pregnancy.,The flu typically begins with the following symptoms:,"
Achiness and fatigue
Fever
Cold symptoms (coughing, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, sneezing, etc)
",A doctor should be contacted as a matter of urgency if the following symptoms present themselves:[6],"
Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
There is blood in the mucus
Chest (abdomen) pain
Dizziness or confusion
Persistent vomiting
The mother cannot feel the baby moving as often as previously. This may be a symptom of miscarriage; see this resource on signs of miscarriage for more information).
",Erythema infectiosum during pregnancy Parvovirus B19,"Erythema infectiosum, also known as fifth disease or slapped cheek syndrome, is a common, non-serious condition caused by parvovirus B19. It is most common in children. Most women are already immune to the virus, making the chances of infection during pregnancy relatively low. However, if contracted during pregnancy, there is a chance that the virus could be passed on to the baby and cause complications, including miscarriage, especially if it develops during the first half of pregnancy.[3]","Pregnant women should seek medical attention urgently if they develop a rash or a high temperature, or if they suspect they have been in contact with others affected by parvovirus B19, even if no symptoms are present. A doctor will be able to screen for the virus, using a blood test, and advise on treatment options thereafter.[7]",Rubella during pregnancy,"Rubella is typically a mild, self-limiting condition. If contracted during pregnancy, especially during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, however, rubella can cause potentially serious harm to the baby. All pregnant women are advised to have the rubella vaccine if they have not received it previously. If a person is unsure whether they have had the vaccine or not, they should contact a doctor who will be able to check via a blood test.[8] Women who have contracted rubella during pregnancy should be counseled on maternal-fetal transmission and offered a pregnancy termination, especially when the infection is diagnosed prior to 16 weeks’ gestation.[9]",Sexually transmitted diseases and infections during pregnancy,"Pregnant women can get the same sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and infections (STIs) as non-pregnant women. STDs and STIs experienced during pregnancy can result in potentially harmful consequences for both the mother and the baby, making it important for pregnant women to be regularly tested throughout their pregnancy.[10] Following a diagnosis, a doctor will be able to prescribe an appropriate treatment method.",Urinary tract infection (UTI) during pregnancy,"Pregnant women are at an increased risk of developing a urinary tract infection (UTI), particularly from week 6 to week 24. If left untreated, a UTI can pose risks to the baby, including premature labor and low birth weight. If you are concerned that you may be developing a urinary tract infection during pregnancy, get a personal health assessment from the Ada app.  A doctor should be consulted if any symptoms of a urinary tract infection are present.",A doctor should be contacted should any of the following symptoms occur:[11],"
Pain or discomfort when urinating
Blood or mucus in the urine
Stomach cramps
Urine leakage
Fever
",Non-infectious conditions during pregnancy,"The following conditions may be pre-existing or develop for the first time during pregnancy. In either case, they may need to be specially managed during pregnancy to prevent complications for the mother or baby.",Anemia during pregnancy,"Anemia involves having a low number of healthy red blood cells. Pregnant women face an increased risk of developing anemia because of the large amount of blood their bodies produce to support the growth of the baby. If detected early, anemia poses little risk to the mother or baby but it can pose health risks if left untreated.","If any of the following symptoms appear, medical attention should be sought:[12]","
Weakness or fatigue
Dizziness
Shortness of breath
Irregular or rapid heartbeat
Pain in the chest
",See this resource for more information about anemia.,Diabetes and gestational diabetes during pregnancy,"Pregnant women who have type 1 or 2 diabetes before becoming pregnant are at risk of various complications affecting both themselves and their babies. These complications include the baby developing health problems after birth, including an increased risk of also developing diabetes. Proper management of the condition is the best way to reduce the risk of complications. Pregnant women, or women planning a pregnancy, should consult their doctor or diabetes specialist for advice on how to do this.[13]","Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that can occur as a result of high blood sugar levels during pregnancy. If gestational diabetes is not properly managed, it can cause complications such as high birth weight, premature birth and, in rare cases, stillbirth. Gestational diabetes is normally screened for as standard, and especially so if the pregnant woman is part of one of the groups most at risk of the condition, women who are overweight, for example. If detected, the condition can be managed through lifestyle changes and medication.[14]",High blood pressure (hypertension) during pregnancy,"Pregnant women will be regularly screened for high blood pressure. If high blood pressure is detected, it will be mild and easily treated with medication in most cases. If a pregnant woman is already taking medication for high blood pressure, they should be sure to inform their doctor or midwife of this, as pregnancy-appropriate medication may be called for.","In severe cases, untreated high blood pressure can develop into a condition called preeclampsia, which can serious cause harm to the mother and baby.[3] See this resource for more information on the diagnosis and treatment of preeclampsia.",Diseases of the thyroid during pregnancy,"Thyroid dysfunction causes the production of too much or too little thyroid hormone, affecting the body’s processes. This can negatively impact the health of pregnant people and their babies, potentially leading to a number of complications if the condition is not effectively managed. These include congenital defects, stillbirth, preterm birth and miscarriage.",See this resource on thyroid and pregnancy for more information.,Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) during pregnancy,"Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), a condition involving the median nerve in the wrist becoming compressed inside the carpal tunnel, can cause pain, tingling and numbness in the hands during pregnancy. The condition is most typical in pregnant women who gain a large amount of weight. Eating a healthy, balanced diet is often an effective way of helping to prevent CTS during pregnancy, as well as a good way of promoting general health. If CTS does occur, the affected person should ask their midwife about ways in which to manage the symptoms. This may involve splints worn at night, gentle hand exercises and massages.[15]",Read more about carpal tunnel syndrome »,Obesity during pregnancy,"Obesity, defined as having a BMI over 30, during pregnancy, can result in a number of health risks for both mother and baby. Risks associated with obesity include gestational diabetes, preeclampsia and stillbirth, as well as an increased risk of diabetes and obesity in later life for the infant. Obesity can be tackled through weight management – a doctor will be able to offer advice on how to do this in a way that is safe to undertake during pregnancy.[16]",Mental health problems during pregnancy,"It is common for pregnant women, including women who have no previous history of mental health problems, to experience mental health problems during pregnancy. These problems can include anxiety and depression and may range from mild to severe. For those experiencing mental health problems, it is important to talk to their doctor or psychiatrist about what they are going through. These professionals will also be able to explain and prescribe treatment options, which may include being referred to a specialist in prenatal mental health or medication, with the treatment choice depending on the severity of symptoms and the person’s history of mental health.[17]",Complications specific to pregnancy,The following complications are specific to the course of pregnancy.,Placenta praevia,"The placenta develops alongside the baby in the womb, connecting the baby to the mother’s blood system and providing it with oxygen and nourishment. Placenta praevia, or low-lying placenta, occurs when the placenta sits low in the uterus and covers part or all of the cervix, the entrance to the womb. In most cases, the placenta will move upwards as the uterus grows larger, though in some women the placenta will remain low-lying in the final stages of pregnancy. The condition will typically be identified through routine scans and monitored throughout the pregnancy. Placenta praevia can lead to bleeding in the second half of pregnancy, which will typically not be accompanied by pain. This bleeding can be heavy and, in severe cases, pose a risk to the baby’s life. The condition, however, is rarely life-threatening, though may require the mother to undergo a cesarean section at birth.[14]",Placental abruption,"Placental abruption occurs when the placenta prematurely separates from the inner wall of the womb (uterus) prior to the baby being born. This separation may be partial or total and may cause bleeding from the vagina or concealed bleeding inside the womb, in which case the bleeding will not be obvious to the mother. In these cases, placental abruption will typically be identified through other symptoms, such as stomach pains.[18] In severe cases, the condition can be life-threatening.","If any of the following symptoms appear, a doctor or midwife should be contacted urgently:[19]","
Bleeding from the vagina
Pain in the stomach
Back pain
Frequent contractions
The baby ceases to move as often as previously
",Antepartum haemorrhage,"Antepartum haemorrhage is bleeding from the birth canal (vagina) after the 24th week of pregnancy. Bleeding before this time results in miscarriage and bleeding, which occurs after the baby has been born, is termed postpartum haemorrhage. In around half of all cases no definite cause of antepartum haemorrhage can be identified. The most important causes of antepartum haemorrhage are placenta praevia and placental abruption, yet they are not the most common. The condition can be life-threatening for the baby, so a doctor should be contacted urgently if any vaginal bleeding occurs.[20]",Ectopic pregnancy,"Ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized egg implants itself outside of the womb, typically in one of the fallopian tubes. If this happens, the embryo is unable to develop properly and will usually need to be removed, using medication or a surgical procedure. Ectopic pregnancy can sometimes be symptomless – in these cases, it will only be detected during a routine scan. The following symptoms can, however, present themselves:[21]","
Stomach pain
Bleeding from the vagina
Pain in the tip of the shoulder
Discomfort when using the bathroom
","If any of these symptoms appear, a doctor or midwife should be contacted as a matter of urgency. Note that these symptoms may also be a sign of another condition. See this resource on ectopic pregnancy for more information.",Molar pregnancy,"A molar pregnancy, sometimes called a hydatidiform mole, is a rare chromosomally abnormal pregnancy resulting from a problem related to the genetic makeup of the fused egg and sperm, which occurs during conception. This causes a fluid-filled mass of tissue to grow inside the womb instead of a healthy pregnancy. A molar pregnancy will not develop into a baby.","A molar pregnancy will often have the same symptoms as a normal pregnancy in its early stages, and may go undetected until the first routine ultrasound scan, if it is not miscarried before this time. However, symptoms which could indicate a molar pregnancy, include vaginal bleeding, severe nausea and vomiting and tummy growth which is faster than normal.",Hyperemesis gravidarum,"Sickness and vomiting is common during pregnancy, affecting roughly 75 percent of pregnant women.[22] For most women, this will disappear at around week 14. Hyperemesis gravidarum is defined as severe vomiting during pregnancy, which may occur several times per day and impair the ability to keep down food and liquids. The condition poses little risk to the baby if managed properly, though a doctor or midwife should be contacted as soon as the condition is suspected.[23]",Low amniotic fluid (oligohydramnios),"Amniotic fluid helps the baby to develop in the womb, making it a vital part of the baby’s life-support system. If the level of amniotic fluid in the womb is low, this is a condition known as oligohydramnios. The condition can develop at any point during pregnancy, but is most common during the final trimester.","If it occurs in the first half of pregnancy, oligohydramnios can cause birth defects and an increased risk of miscarriage. If it occurs in the second half of pregnancy, complications include premature birth and problems during labor, such as cord compression. Amniotic fluid levels are monitored closely throughout pregnancy, and if oligohydramnios is detected, doctors will be able to suggest treatment methods, which, if the mother is in the final stages of pregnancy, may include inducing labor.[24]",Miscarriage,"Miscarriage occurs when an embryo or fetus dies during the first 23 weeks of pregnancy, with most miscarriages happening within the first three months. It is often difficult to identify exactly what causes miscarriage, though some known causes include gene defects, pre-existing condition, (such as diabetes, and severe infection. See this resource on miscarriage for more information.","In some cases, there will be no apparent signs of a miscarriage, and it will only become apparent during a scan.[25] In other cases, symptoms may include vaginal bleeding, stomach pain and cramping, though these symptoms may be a sign of another condition and not miscarriage. If any of these symptoms occur, it is important to seek medical attention as soon as possible to enable a doctor to identify the problem.[26] See this resource on signs of miscarriage for more information about spotting its various potential indicators.",Stillbirth,"A stillbirth is when a baby is born dead after 24 weeks of pregnancy. The cause of stillbirth cannot always be identified, though in some cases it is linked to problems with the placenta or the health of the mother. If the baby is moving less frequently than usual or not moving at all, a doctor or midwife should be contacted urgently. They will be able to run tests and identify any problems that may be occuring.[27]",Obstetric cholestasis,"Obstetric cholestasis is a relatively rare liver condition occurring when the normal level of bile exiting the liver is reduced. The main symptom of obstetric cholestasis is pruritus, itching, sparing the face, which can range in severity from mild to severe. This symptom alone is typically enough for a presumptive diagnosis. Although this itching can occur at any point during pregnancy, it is most common in the final three months. Generally, the itching will cease soon after birth and cause no long-term health problems, though skin tissue damage (excoriation) is possible. The condition has, however, been linked to premature birth and stillbirth in some cases, meaning it will be closely monitored by doctors and midwives. Birth may be induced early (after 37 or 38 weeks) to reduce the risk of stillbirth if the condition is considered to be severe.[28]",Preterm (premature) labor and birth,"Preterm labor is defined as contractions beginning and the cervix shortening before week 37 of pregnancy, with most occurrences taking place between week 34 and week 37. Preterm labor is relatively common, and only roughly one in five cases of preterm labor result in premature birth. Although it is difficult for doctors to foresee which women will experience preterm labor, certain factors – such as carrying twins or triplets, having experienced preterm labor in the past and some medical conditions (high blood pressure, for example) – make it more likely.","If preterm labor begins in a pregnancy of 34 weeks or over, doctors will typically allow the birth to continue naturally, as the baby will often be sufficiently mature to survive outside of the womb. This, however, depends on the specific circumstances. If preterm labor begins in a pregnancy of under 34 weeks, doctors may use methods to delay the birth, until the baby can be given steroids to prepare it for birth, and the mother can be transferred to a specialist care unit. In some cases, labor may be halted completely, though this is generally not advised.[29]","If a baby is born before week 37 of pregnancy, they are at risk of being underdeveloped and suffering potentially lifelong health issues and disabilities, such as cerebral palsy and learning disabilities. The earlier the birth, the higher the chances of health issues, with babies born before week 34 being most vulnerable.[30]",Preeclampsia,"Preeclampsia is a condition involving pregnant women developing high blood pressure and protein in the urine (proteinuria), usually after week 20 of pregnancy. These symptoms will typically only be detected during a routine check-up, though other symptoms, such as headaches, vision problems and swelling of the feet, ankles, face and hands may also occur.[31]","Should such symptoms present, pregnant women should visit their doctor to identify what is causing them. In the majority of cases, preeclampsia will result in no serious health problems for mother or baby and will disappear soon after birth. However, in rare instances, preeclampsia can result in serious health issues such as fits and blood clotting problems. Gestational hypertension can also occur without the appearance of protein in the urine (proteinuria). The condition may also result in gestational hypertension. Proper monitoring of the condition by healthcare professionals can help reduce the chances of such complications occurring.[32]",Rhesus problems,"Each person’s blood falls into one of four blood groups (A, B, AB, O) and is either rhesus (Rh) positive or negative. If a pregnant woman has rhesus negative blood and her baby has rhesus positive blood, the body’s immune system may detect these foreign blood cells and produce antibodies to attack them.","If this happens, the baby can develop rhesus disease which can cause anemia and jaundice in newborns. This, however, is rare. Newly pregnant women routinely undergo blood tests to identify whether they are rhesus positive or negative. If they are found to be rhesus negative they will be prescribed anti-D immunoglobulin injections at 28 to 32 weeks’ gestation and again within 72 hours of birth to prevent the immune system from producing antibodies to attack the baby’s blood cells.[3]","Pregnancy complications in multiple pregnancy - twins, triplets, etc.","The majority of women who are pregnant with multiple babies, whether twins, triplets or more, will experience no serious complications. However, the higher the number of babies in one pregnancy, the higher the risk of problems. Due to this, women pregnant with more than one baby will be monitored even more closely than usual.[33]",The most common complications associated with a multiple birth include:[33][34],"
Premature labor and birth
Low birth weight
Gestational diabetes
Gestational hypertension
Anemia
Miscarriage
Congenital deformity, including anencephaly, facial clefts and malformations of the spine
","If it becomes apparent that a woman is pregnant with two or more babies, doctors and midwives will advise on the necessary steps to help avoid complications.",Pregnancy complications FAQs,"Q: What are the possible complications of early pregnancy?
A: In early pregnancy, generally defined as the first trimester, complications are commonly due to the pregnancy not forming properly and consequently becoming unviable. This will typically occur before the mother becomes aware she is pregnant, or very soon afterwards, and cause miscarriage. Abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding are common signs of early pregnancy miscarriage; if this occurs, women are advised to contact a doctor urgently. Vaginal bleeding and abdominal cramping can also occur in otherwise healthy pregnancies, so are not necessarily signs of miscarriage.[35]","Q: Can a vegan or vegetarian diet cause complications during pregnancy?
A: Research suggests that people who follow a vegan or vegetarian diet may be at higher risk of having a baby with birth defects. This is thought to be due to a deficiency of vitamin B12, which is commonly found in animal products. Vegan or vegetarian women who are trying to become pregnant should talk to a doctor, who will be able to advise on ways in which to mitigate this risk. This will usually be through supplementation.[35]","Q: Can an IUD cause pregnancy complications?
A: An intrauterine device, otherwise known as an IUD or coil, is a device fitted in the uterus to prevent pregnancy. Although IUDs are one of the most effective methods of contraception, in rare instance, a woman can become pregnant despite use of the device. If this occurs, the IUD will be immediately removed. Research suggests that if a pregnancy occurs in this way, there is no significant risk of the pregnancy being miscarried or of the baby being born with defects.[36]"
,,,,,,,,,,What is premature labor?
,,,,,,,,,,What is premature labor?,"Premature labor, or preterm labor, is labor that begins after the 20th week and before the 37th week of pregnancy. Labor is defined as the the beginning of regular contractions and the shortening of the cervix (opening of the womb). Most cases of premature labor occur between the 34th week and the 37th week.","Premature labor is relatively common, taking place in roughly 7 in 100 single baby births. In pregnancies of twins or triplets, premature labor is even more common – the average delivery date for twins is the 37th week and for triplets, the 33rd week.[1] A variety of other factors, including smoking and drinking alcohol during pregnancy, can also make premature labor more likely.","Roughly 1 in 10 cases of premature labour will result in a premature birth.[2] In cases where the baby is sufficiently developed to survive after birth (usually babies older than 34 weeks), labor will generally be allowed to progress naturally. If the baby is less developed (pre-34 weeks), a variety of methods can be used to delay labor until the baby is sufficiently mature.",Causes of premature labor,"In many cases, the cause of premature labor cannot be clearly identified. However, several factors are known to make premature labor more likely.",Factors that make premature pregnancy more likely include:[1][3],"
Womb or cervical abnormalities
Carrying twins or triplets
Excess fluid in the womb (polyhydramnios)
Placenta praevia (when the placenta attaches near or over the cervical opening)
Cervical insufficiency (when the cervix begins to open prematurely)
Fertility treatment (for the current pregnancy)
Less than six months between two pregnancies
Premature birth in previous pregnancy
Premature rupture of membranes (waters breaking before labor has begun) in a previous pregnancy
Late miscarriage in a previous pregnancy
",Factors concerning the pregnant woman’s health can also make premature labor more likely. These include:,"
Having a urinary tract infection
High blood pressure
Preeclampsia, eclampsia or HELLP syndrome
Problems with blood clotting
Smoking
Drinking alcohol during pregnancy
Use of illegal drugs during pregnancy
Stress
Being under 18 or over 35 years old
",Vaginal infections may also make premature labour more likely. These include:,"
Gonorrhea
Chlamydia
Syphilis
Trichomoniasis
Bacterial vaginosis
Infections caused by Group B streptococci.
",Symptoms and warning signs of premature labor,The symptoms and warning signs of premature labor include:[1],"
The waters breaking (rupture of the membranes). The pregnant woman may feel a soft popping sensation, followed by a slow trickle or gush of clear or pinkish liquid from the vagina. In some cases, there may only be an increase in vaginal discharge.
If the waters break, contractions may begin. These may be regular and are often painless.
",Other symptoms of premature labor include:,"
An aching back
Strong cramps (which may be painful)
A need to urinate often
Pressure in the pelvis
Nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhoea
The mucus plug in the cervix comes away
","These symptoms may also occur if an individual is not in premature labor. However, a pregnant woman experiencing any of these symptoms should contact their doctor or midwife urgently.",Premature labor diagnosis,Diagnosis is usually made based on the symptoms and a physical examination. This will involve a gynecological exam to see if the cervix (the opening to the womb) has opened as well as general checks on the health of the mother and baby. This may include:[1],"
Temperature, pulse and blood pressure checks
A check of the baby’s heartbeat (to look for irregularities)
A blood test and vaginal swab (to check for infection)
An ultrasound
",Premature labor treatment,Treatment generally depends on how far along the pregnancy is and the general health of the mother and/or baby. Options available to doctors include:[1][4],"
Allowing labor to continue naturally. This is generally advised in pregnancies of 34 weeks or more, when the baby will be sufficiently mature to survive outside of the womb. Nevertheless, the birth should still take place in a hospital where specialist care can be administered should it be necessary.
Artificially delaying birth to allow time for doctors to prepare the baby for birth (usually steroids will be used to mature the baby’s lungs) and transfer the mother to a specialist care unit. This option will generally be advised in pregnancies of under 34 weeks. Birth will normally be delayed for at least 48 hours, and ideally for longer if needed. Due to the possible complications, this option is usually avoided if possible.
Accelerating delivery using medication or caesarean section. This option will typically be chosen if the mother and/or baby are unwell.
",Premature labor prevention,"As the causes of premature labor are not always clear, prevention can be difficult. However, there are several steps a pregnant woman can take to help reduce the risk of premature labor.","Being tested for and treating infections can help to prevent some cases of premature birth. Receiving treatment for STIs is important during pregnancy, as is avoiding food poisoning by not eating certain foods (such as raw or undercooked meat, unpasteurized milk and pâté) and maintaining high general hygiene standards (washing the hands regularly, for example).","Certain lifestyle choices can also help reduce the risk of premature labor. Staying active through regular light exercise is generally advised for pregnant women – this will also boost overall wellbeing and help reduce the chances of conditions such as diabetes and preeclampsia, which can contribute to the onset of premature labor.[5]",Premature labor complications,"The earlier a premature baby is born, the greater the risk of complications. Possible complications include:[6]","
Immature lungs are the main concern for babies born early. In most cases, a baby’s lungs are mature by roughly week 36 of pregnancy. Babies born earlier than this may be given steroids to help accelerate the maturation process.
",Immature lungs can increase the risk of further complications. These include:,"
Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS): A condition involving irregular breathing and a lack of surfactant – a substance that helps prevent the lungs from collapsing – in the lungs.
Transient tachypnea: A condition characterized by rapid shallow breathing.
Pneumonia: An infection of the lungs that can cause breathing problems.
",Other possible complications include:,"
Infection: Premature babies are at high risk of infection. For this reason, premature babies will be kept in an incubator to protect against bacteria.
Jaundice: A yellowing of the skin caused by a lack of the substance bilirubin. See this resource on neonatal jaundice for further information.
Anemia: A condition involving low levels of red blood cells in the blood.
",Premature labor FAQs,"Q: What happens if my waters break but I am not in labor?
A: It is possible for the waters to break but for a woman to not be in labor, this is called preterm prelabor rupture of the membranes (P-PROM). If this happens, in most cases antibiotics will be administered to prevent infection (made more likely by the breaking of the waters) and steroids given to help mature the baby’s lungs. Doctors will generally aim to delay the birth until at least 34 weeks and after this induce labor artificially.[1]",Other names for premature labor,"

,,,,,,,,,,What is premenstrual syndrome?
,,,,,,,,,,What is premenstrual syndrome?,"The term premenstrual syndrome (PMS) describes a variety of physical and emotional changes that may occur in a woman in the days before her menstrual period begins. This condition is very common, and affects the majority of menstruating women in one way or another. These changes include a low mood, increased appetite, tender breasts, mood changes, irritability and acne. The severity of symptoms varies from person to person. These symptoms tend to repeat in a predictable pattern before a period. Treatment involves lifestyle changes and medications which help to manage the menstrual cycle. Although PMS cannot be cured, the symptoms can usually be well managed.",Risks,"The normal menstrual cycle is controlled by rising and falling levels of the hormones estrogen and progesterone. These hormones are responsible for developing and releasing the ova (eggs) and preparing the body for pregnancy, in the case that the egg becomes fertilized. If no fertilization occurs, menstrual bleeding occurs. Although the exact cause of premenstrual syndrome is not well understood, it’s likely that these changing hormone levels are responsible for the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome. This condition is very common, and affects the majority of menstruating women in one way or another.",Symptoms,"Typical symptoms of PMS include emotional and physical symptoms. These vary widely from person to person, and may range from mild to causing problems with one's work or home life. Emotional symptoms include mood swings, irritability, sleeping difficulties, food cravings and poor concentration. Physical symptoms include bloating, breast tenderness, decreased energy, weight gain, nausea, swelling of the feet, impaired concentration and headaches.",Diagnosis,The diagnosis usually is made based on the symptoms and their relation to the menstrual period. Usually no tests are needed to confirm the diagnosis. A diary of symptoms can be helpful to make the diagnosis.,Treatment,"The treatment involves managing the symptoms. This may be achieved by making lifestyle changes or with medications. Regular exercise, having a good support network and learning relaxation techniques may be helpful in reducing symptoms. Some medications are helpful, including the (oral contraceptive) pill, and low dose anti-depressant medications. In severe cases, surgical removal of the ovaries may be an option. This causes infertility, so it is most appropriate for women who are not planning to become pregnant.",Prevention,"Keeping a symptom diary may help to recognize days in the cycle which are associated with worse symptoms, and being able to anticipate these may help to manage these better."
,,,,,,,,,,What is prenatal diagnosis?
,,,,,,,,,,What is prenatal diagnosis?,"Prenatal diagnosis uses a variety of testing methods to determine whether a fetus has certain genetic or physical abnormalities before birth. At different stages during pregnancy, these methods are used to detect issues such as Down syndrome (trisomy 21), hemophilia, thalassemia, Turner syndrome, spina bifida and Huntington’s disease.","The International Society for Prenatal Diagnosis (ISPD) was founded in 1996 to advance the “science and practice of genetics and fetal care worldwide [and] promote the health of children, their mothers and their families.“[1]",What is prenatal screening?,"Prenatal screening tests can determine the likelihood of a fetus having an abnormality. Parents at particular risk of certain problems may choose to use a variety of prenatal diagnostic tests. This decision is based on factors including their level of risk, the prenatal (before birth) or postnatal (after birth) care required to address a particular issue, and the parents’ comfort with their risk level.","Prenatal screening consists of non-invasive tests, including:","
Ultrasound
Maternal serum tests
Prenatal cell-free DNA (cfDNA) screening (to determine the likelihood that a fetus will have a genetic disorder)
","These screenings are considered together to determine a statistical probability of an issue occurring, but they cannot diagnose the existence of these issues with certainty. If a fetus is determined to have a high likelihood of a genetic abnormality, parents are encouraged to undergo diagnostic testing such as amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS), which directly test the fetal cells. The amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS) tests are more definitive than non-invasive screenings, but do carry risks to the fetus, such as miscarriage or congenital abnormalities.**",Purposes of prenatal diagnosis,"In testing for these potential issues, prenatal diagnosis provides information to parents and doctors as early as possible, so that they can determine the best course of care for the fetus, both before and after birth. It can also detect issues that, if left unaddressed, could result in negative outcomes (including death) for the fetus or mother. This knowledge can lessen the risk for conditions requiring prenatal care or that may result in more difficult births.","Additionally, this can tell the doctors whether they should prepare to administer special care to the infant right after birth. It can also allow parents to prepare physically, emotionally and/or financially for the chance that their child will have specific medical needs. Some parents may choose to terminate the pregnancy if the information discovered during prenatal testing suggests that the fetus will not develop into a healthy baby, would not survive long outside the womb or would have an extremely poor quality of life.[2]",Prenatal diagnostic tests,Amniocentesis,"Amniocentesis is an invasive prenatal diagnostic test in which a long, thin needle is passed through the mother’s abdomen (belly) and uterus into the amniotic sac to extract amniotic fluid. The fetal cells in the amniotic fluid are analyzed for irregularities in chromosomes and biochemicals. This test is usually performed in the second trimester at between 14-20 weeks of pregnancy, or as early as amniotic fluid levels will permit testing.",Amniocentesis can also be used to test for:,"
Rhesus factor: This is a very important blood factor which can cause problems when the baby’s Rh factor is different to that of the pregnant person. This can cause Rh sensitization if blood passes between the developing fetus and the mother.
Fetal lung development (by the third trimester)
","Women may experience discomfort and cramping during this test, and should rest for the remainder of the day after it is administered. In rarer cases they may also be advised to rest for 24 or even up to 48 hours after the procedure.","Amniocentesis can detect chromosomal disorders such as Down syndrome; genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis; and neural tube defects such as spina bifida.[3] It is not used to detect structural birth defects. Due to its ability to also determine a baby’s gender, amniocentesis is subject to legal restrictions in some countries.","The fetus is not injured during amniocentesis, though the procedure does slightly increase the risk of miscarriage.",Chorionic villus sampling (CVS),"Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) is typically carried out by passing a catheter, guided by ultrasound, from the vagina through the cervix and into the uterus, accessing the chorionic villi cells of the placenta. These cells share genetic material with the fetus. Depending on the placement of the placenta in the mother’s body, it may also be administered transabdominally (through the belly), using a long thin needle, in a procedure similar to amniocentesis.","These cells are then analyzed using a variety of methods, with the most common being chromosomal analysis. CVS detects almost all chromosomal disorders, such as Down syndrome, as well as hundreds of genetic disorders, such as sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs disease. It does not detect neural tube defects. Unclear results showing a discrepancy between the chromosomes of the cells in the placenta and the cells in the baby, called placental mosaicism, occur between 1-2% of the time with CVS. Amniocentesis (another test to check for chromosomal conditions) may be necessary to gain definitive results.[4]","CVS can be administered as early as 10 weeks into the pregnancy, in the first trimester. Mothers do not typically experience pronounced discomfort during the test, but some may have light bleeding (spotting) afterwards.","CVS is considered an invasive test, and carries a slightly higher risk of miscarriage than does amniocentesis, as well as other possible risks, including infection or Rh sensitization (in which the Rh positive blood cells from the baby enter the pregnant person’s bloodstream, potentially causing pregnancy complications). In rare cases, it is linked to fetal deformities of the fingers and toes, but current research suggests that this risk is smaller if the test is done after the 11th week of pregnancy.",Preimplantation genetic diagnosis,"When an embryo is created for use in in-vitro fertilization (IVF), cells removed from the embryo can be used to diagnose chromosomal abnormalities and genetic disorders prior to implantation. The fetus produced by a screened embryo is extremely unlikely to have the tested disorder. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis may also be called preimplantation genetic profiling.",Prenatal screening,Ultrasound,"Ultrasound is a common and non-invasive procedure that uses sound waves passing through the womb and the fetus to create an image of the fetus’s body and development. It is typically used to screen for structural birth defects at between 16-20 weeks of pregnancy. Ultrasound testing is useful for physical issues such as heart malformations or cleft palates, and to detect the fetus’s position in the womb, but it is not as effective as the invasive means mentioned above to detect genetic issues.","An ultrasound test for fetal nuchal translucency (NT) monitors the back of the fetus’s neck for signs of thickening or increased fluid, an early sign of problems such as Down syndrome, trisomy 18 or heart issues.",Prenatal cell-free DNA (cfDNA) screening,"Prenatal cell-free DNA (cfDNA) screening is a relatively new, non-invasive test for the likelihood that a fetus will have  some chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome, trisomy 13 or trisomy 18. In some cases, it can screen for increased risk of trisomy 16, trisomy 22, triploidy, sex chromosome aneuploidy (abnormal number of sex chromosomes), Prader-Willi syndrome and other microdeletion syndromes, as well as some single-gene disorders affecting the fetus’s skeleton and bones. It can also determine the sex and rhesus blood type (Rh) of the developing fetus. As this test screens maternal blood to locate fetal DNA entering the mother’s body through the placenta, its samples are too small for some common testing procedures, so it is only useful for certain conditions, like the ones mentioned above.","CfDNA screening can be carried out after the 10th week of pregnancy, and does not increase risk of miscarriage. However, women who are obese, carrying more than one fetus or pregnant with a donor egg or as a gestational carrier (also known as a surrogate mother) may not receive accurate results from this test. It is often recommended for women with increased risk of having a baby with chromosomal abnormalities – such as older mothers or mothers who have previously given birth to a baby with these conditions – and for women with Rh negative blood types.",Screening for Rh status,"A very small proportion of the population has Rh negative blood types, and if a mother with Rh negative blood is carrying a baby with Rh positive blood, meaning they are Rh incompatible, it can cause complications. If fetal blood enters the mother’s circulatory system, it triggers the production of antibodies in the mother’s system that can subsequently, most likely when the mother will be pregnant with her second Rh positive baby, attack the Rh factor in the fetus’s blood.","This will damage the babies’  red blood cells and cause anemia in the baby. This condition, which is unlikely to develop under effective prenatal care, is called Rh disease and can lead to complications including jaundice, brain damage, miscarriage or stillbirth.","The administration of a Rh immune globulin shot to the mother following any chance of exposure to fetal blood prevents these antibodies from forming. Typically, fetal blood only enters the mother’s system during birth, so these antibodies would attack the next fetus with Rh positive blood that the mother carries. In some cases, though, fetal blood can enter the mother’s body during routine testing such as amniocentesis or CVS – due to vaginal bleeding, an ectopic pregnancy or an abdominal injury – so a Rh negative mother will receive the Rh immune globulin shot within 72 hours to prevent antibody formation.","This screening is important, as once the antibodies are in the mother’s system, they cannot be removed. They increase, along with the potential for damage to the fetus, with each Rh positive fetus that the mother carries or gives birth to. There are effective treatments for Rh disease after the fetus’s birth, including blood transfusions.",Maternal serum tests and quad screen test,"Numerous blood tests are a part of prenatal screening, and may be administered at various times throughout the pregnancy. These are non-invasive tests.",Pregnancy associated plasma protein screening (PAPP-A),"Usually measured in the first trimester, this test monitors the level of a protein produced by the placenta. High levels may be associated with chromosomal abnormalities such as trisomy 13, 18 and 21, while low levels can indicate that the fetus may be underweight or stillborn. High levels may also indicate an unusually large fetus.",Alpha-fetoprotein screening (AFP),"Alpha-fetoprotein screening (AFP) tests the levels of alpha-fetoprotein, a fetal liver protein that can cross into the mother’s blood. It is one of the second trimester tests referred to as quad screen test, and it is usually performed along with three other tests, for HCG, estriol and inhibin.","High levels of this protein can suggest neural tube defects such as spina bifida or anencephaly, but not with certainty, as AFP levels can be elevated for several reasons – such as if the fetus’s conception time (the moment the father’s sperm impregnates the mother’s egg) is not accurately known. Abnormal levels of AFP can also indicate chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome, defects in the fetus’s abdominal wall, or the carriage of multiple fetuses.",Beta-HCG screening,"High levels of this placental protein may indicate chromosomal abnormalities. Combined with maternal serum AFP (MSAFP) results, it can suggest Down syndrome.[5] This is one of the quad screen test markers.",Estriol screening,"Another one of the quad screen tests, the test for estriol levels indicates whether the mother is healthy, the fetus is viable and the placenta is functioning. Low levels of estriol in the third trimester may indicate Down syndrome, adrenal hypoplasia with anencephaly or that an emergency delivery is necessary.",Inhibin-A,"High levels of inhibin-A can be associated with trisomy 21, while lower levels might indicate that the baby is at risk of an early delivery. It is one of the four markers in the quad screen test.",Risks of prenatal diagnosis,"Although every pregnancy carries the risk of miscarriage, non-invasive screenings like ultrasound, prenatal cell-free DNA (cfDNA) screening or maternal serum tests do not increase this risk. They are not linked to any risks for the developing fetus or pregnant person, other than the usual risks involved with drawing a blood sample from the mother’s veins, including bruising of the site and slight pain where the needle enters the vein.",Both CVS and amniocentesis carry an additional risk of miscarriage compared to other tests.[6]  This is due to the nature of the procedure (an injection which passes through the wall of the womb).,"
For amniocentesis, the increased risk of miscarriage is approximately 1 percent, meaning that 1 in 100 people who undergo this test will miscarry as a result.
For CVS, the increased risk of miscarriage is 1-2 percent, meaning that 1-2 in 100 people who undergo the CVS test will miscarry as a result.
",Although these tests are performed safely and do not result in miscarriage in the majority of cases. Doctors will recommend these tests only in cases where they feel that the information gained about possible problems which can then be treated will significantly outweigh the risk of miscarriage.,"Continuous guidance by ultrasound during the procedure can minimize this risk, as it helps ensure that only one attempt will be necessary. In rare cases, CVS has been linked to fetal deformities of the fingers and toes, but current research suggests that this risk is lowered if the test is done after the 11th week of pregnancy.","Preimplantation genetic diagnosis can have major risks, including death of the embryo due to the procedure or due to thawing from cryopreservation. It can also be linked to the potential for an unsuccessful birth of the fetus.",FAQ,"Q:Who should use prenatal diagnosis?
A: Prenatal diagnosis may be suggested to women older than 35 years old or who have issues such as high blood pressure, diabetes, epilepsy or lupus, as they are at higher risk to carry a fetus with certain problems. It is also recommended for women whose partners have genetic disorders, women who have previously had children with these issues or women who are pregnant with more than one fetus.","Due to the risks to the fetus associated with invasive testing, many women start with non-invasive genetic risk screenings, which can reveal their fetus’s likelihood of risk, but cannot provide a true diagnosis. Women who receive a high-risk score may then choose to undergo prenatal diagnostic testing. Women have different levels of comfort with risk, and may choose to undergo prenatal diagnostic testing at higher or lower risk levels.","Preconception genetic screening (screening the individual partners for conditions before the egg and sperm have fused and produced the embryo) is also available, which can tell parents whether they are likely to pass on certain genetic conditions but – as there is no fetus in the mother’s uterus at the time – it does not reveal a particular fetus’s risk of abnormality.","Depending on the health system, some doctors make testing for some birth defects available to all mothers regardless of their risk screenings, and allow the mother to decide.","Q: What is prenatal diagnosis for Down syndrome?
A: Two major types of prenatal testing for Down syndrome exist: prenatal screening and diagnostic testing. Prenatal screening is typically a combination of maternal serum tests, an ultrasound and statistical information about the mother’s age. These tests cannot definitively diagnose Down syndrome, but can give the likelihood that the fetus will have Down syndrome, with an accuracy of about 80%. Prenatal cell-free DNA (cfDNA) screening has recently emerged as another screening method, with higher accuracy. These screenings are offered to pregnant people in most medical contexts,  regardless of age, and are often completed by 14 weeks, within the first trimester.","Amniocentesis and CVS are diagnostic tests that can diagnose Down syndrome with nearly 100% accuracy, however, they also may lead to a higher risk of miscarriage, as high as 1 or 2% higher than the general risk for miscarriage any mother has.[7] For this reason, they are often recommended only to women who have undergone a prenatal screening and found to be carrying a fetus likely to have Down syndrome.","Q: What is prenatal diagnosis for autism?
A: Right now, there is no definitive prenatal diagnosis for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the fetus. There is some evidence that a fetus with ASD undergoes faster growth of the brain and body during the second trimester, and these changes can be made visible by ultrasound. Some evidence also suggests abnormal development of some parts of the brain.[8] Not all babies that will develop ASD have chromosomal abnormalities, so many prenatal diagnostic tests have little to no effectiveness in that regard."
,,,,,,,,,,What is a colonoscopy?
,,,,,,,,,,What is a colonoscopy?,"A colonoscopy involves inserting a thin, flexible tube called a colonoscope into the body through the anus to examine the colon (large intestine) and rectum. The main purpose of a colonoscopy is to investigate symptoms which may be coming from the colon and colorectal area, such as:","
Abdominal pain
Constipation
Passing blood with bowel movements.
Persistent diarrhoea
",During a colonoscopy it is possible to identify growths and other intestinal problems; including:,"
Non-cancerous polyps
Colon cancers
Bleeding
Areas of inflammation
","It is necessary for the whole colon to be visible to the video camera on the end of the colonoscope, otherwise it is impossible to carry out this screening process effectively. If you are concerned about the health of yourself or a loved one, download the Ada app for a free assessment.","People are recommended to follow particular instructions in preparation for a colonoscopy, including following a specialized colonoscopy prep diet and activity plan. The purpose of this is to induce a kind of diarrhea, emptying the area to be screened of stool and other waste to ensure full visibility. This process is known as colonoscopy prep.",How to prepare for a colonoscopy: what to expect,The aim of colonoscopy prep is to ensure that the colon is empty and clean before the screening. This normally involves:,"
Following a colonoscopy prep diet. This is made up of low fiber food; this stage lasts for three to four days, with a liquid-only food intake on the final day before the colonoscopy.
Drinking bowel-cleaning liquids. These are medications called laxatives, which may take the form of pills or drinks, and which are taken to induce diarrhea. They will most commonly be taken the night before the screening, often with another dose on the morning of the screening. This is called a split-dose-regimen.[1][2]
An enema before the colonoscopy. This may be given in cases where the large intestine is difficult to empty, for example due to constipation.
","Good to know: People preparing for a colonoscopy experience frequent bowel movements as the preparatory medications take effect, and will need ready access to a bathroom at all times. It is for this reason that clearing one’s schedule of appointments for at least one day before the screening and staying at home are both highly recommended.",Colonoscopy prep tips: creating the optimum setup,"Before starting colonoscopy prep, most people find it helpful to shop for all the supplies that they will need. In addition to the foods and liquids that will be eaten as part of the food intake plan, people preparing for a colonoscopy may wish to purchase products to soothe the skin around the anus, specifically diaper cream (to soothe the skin) and alcohol-free cleansing wipes containing aloe-vera or vitamin E.",Food planning for colonoscopy prep: what to eat and what to avoid,"During colonoscopy prep, one should aim to eat a diet which is nutritious, but which does not cause large amounts of feces to form in the intestine. Three days in advance, it is important to stop taking fiber supplement products, as these help the body to produce fecal matter and would work against the colonoscopy preparations.","At this point, it is important to stop taking all other supplements and vitamins, as well as any medicines that contain iron.[3] Physicians or hospital staff will advise on whether and when to stop taking any prescription medicines that are normally used regularly, and on the use of over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications, such as ibuprofen.",Low fiber food,"Eating low-fiber food for three or four days before the procedure will help to empty the colon, because low-fiber foods are easy to digest and leave one’s system quickly.",Foods to avoid during colonoscopy prep include:,"
Fatty foods
Fruit with seeds or peel such as apples, berries or figs
High-fibre cereals such as bran flakes or granola
High-fibre vegetables such as corn, broccoli, cabbage, beans or peas
Legumes such as dried peas, lentils or split peas
Seeds, nuts or popcorn
Tough meat with gristle
Raw vegetables
Whole grains
",Low-fibre food options which are suitable for colonoscopy prep include:,"
Cooked vegetables without skin or peel
Eggs
Fish
Fruit without skin or seeds
Lean meat such as chicken, turkey or veal
Well-cooked vegetables without skin
Breads and cakes made with refined white flour such as bagels, muffins or rolls
Pasta and rice
Potatoes without skin
Smooth peanut butter or almond butter
",Avoid solids,"The day before before the colonoscopy, it is recommended to avoid solid food completely. Consuming liquids only for this time period helps prevent new fecal matter from forming, entering the colon and being present during the screening, and will ensure that the colon remains empty and clean.",It is important to avoid red and purple food dyes[4] as they can discolor the lining of the colon and make it harder to see the area being examined during the colonoscopy.,Drinks and liquid foods which are suitable to eat the day before the screening include:,"
Clear broth, including chicken, beef, or vegetable
Clear, light-colored juices such as apple, white grape, lemonade without pulp, and white cranberry
Flavored water
Jell-O or other gelatin without fruit (taking care to avoid red and purple food colouring)
Popsicles without fruit or cream
Water
Soda
Sports drinks such as Gatorade and Propel (light colors only)
Tea and black coffee without any cream, milk or sweetener
",Cleansing the bowel,"The aim of colonoscopy prep is to pass all the fecal matter from the area to be examined during the screening, so that there is nothing left to obstruct the view of the colonoscope. To aid the process of emptying the bowel, one will be prescribed a laxative product to take as part of the colonoscopy prep. In some cases, enemas may also be prescribed.","Good to know: Many people pass clear, yellow liquid once they have finished passing waste. This yellow liquid which a person may pass is made up of digestive juices and does not indicate that the prep has been ineffective. However, if the person preparing for the colonoscopy is still passing liquid containing fecal matter, or brown, cloudy liquid, they should seek medical advice as they will need to take additional steps to clean their colorectal region before the screening can be performed.",Colonoscopy prep medications,Laxative medications help the stool to pass smoothly through the colon.,"Before a colonoscopy, osmotic laxatives are most commonly prescribed. These work to empty the bowel by drawing the water from the large intestine into the stool in order to soften it, making it easier to pass. These are usually drunk dissolved in large amounts of water. Specific instructions for preparing the solution vary from brand to brand, and will found be on the packet of the product that has been prescribed.","Seek medical advice if there is any confusion about how to prepare the solution and when to take it. Because these medications work by keeping water in the bowel, it is important to drink enough liquid to stay hydrated. Drink water, or one of the recommended liquids, regularly throughout the colonoscopy prep plan.","Good to know: It is important, and not harmful, for a person preparing for a colonoscopy to drink the prep solution as planned, even if they already have diarrhea before starting to to take it. The prep solution is designed to ensure that any solid stool which may have formed higher up in the colon is passed before the scan.",How long should colonoscopy prep take to start working?,"Most colonoscopy prep products start working two to three hours after they are taken, although the exact time-frame varies between medications. In some cases, if bowel movements do not begin to occur when expected, an extra dose may be needed. However, it is always advisable to follow the specific instructions that come with the product in relation to taking an extra dose and to consult with one’s medical provider in case of any doubts.",How to drink colonoscopy prep medications without throwing up,It is possible for drinking the solution to make one feel nauseous. Tips which may help a person to avoid nausea include:,"
Sipping the solution slowly
Taking breaks between sips
Using a straw
Cooling the liquid instead of drinking it at room temperature
","If nausea is known to be a problem for the affected person in general, or has been experienced in a previous screening, anti-nausea medications may be recommended.[5]","To avoid vomiting, it can also be helpful to leave longer intervals between drinks. If someone does vomit after consuming a dose of the solution during their colonoscopy prep, it is important to repeat the dose.",How to tell if colonoscopy prep has been effective: what to expect,"Prep is complete when bowel movements become watery and clear. This means that the colon is empty of fecal matter and is ready to be viewed by the colonoscopy camera without obstructions. The length of time that it takes to reach this point will vary between people and will depend on factors, such as their overall gastrointestinal health, and how well the prep diet plan was followed.","Good to know: When bowel movements become clear enough to see the bottom of the toilet bowl, colonoscopy prep can be considered complete.","Seek medical attention if significant amounts of blood, or blood clots, are passed during colonoscopy prep. Colonoscopy prep may cause any hemorrhoids that are present to bleed slightly, as they might normally during a bowel movement. In all cases where bleeding appears to come from a source other than existing hemorrhoids, or is excessive, a medical opinion should be sought as soon as possible, and the bleeding should be mentioned before the procedure.[6]",What to do if colonoscopy prep is not working,"The purpose of colonoscopy prep is to remove all fecal matter from the bowel. If a person usually suffers from constipation or chronic constipation, they may need an extended prep period before their colonoscopy. It is helpful to discuss constipation issues with the doctor when planning a colonoscopy, so that the preparation time can be adjusted if needed.","An extended preparation period typically involves the use of enemas and doubling the colonoscopy prep time-frame. Prep will then involve a period of over three or four days of eating low-fiber food, followed by two days of consuming nutritious liquids and colonoscopy prep solution.",Enemas,"In some cases, following the specialized food intake plan and using laxatives are sufficient to empty the bowel. However, other people, particularly those who are suffering from constipation, may need additional assistance to empty the bowel before their colonoscopy. If the bowel is not fully empty following colonoscopy prep, an enema will be prescribed.","The type of enema which is incorporated into colonoscopy prep is called a cleansing enema. It involves injecting liquid into the bowel via the rectum. This helps the body to push out any remaining waste. The liquid which will be used is usually a water-based solution with a small concentration of stool softener. The volume of water stimulates the movement of the large intestine, which in turn stimulates the bowels to expel both the solution and any remaining fecal matter.","If the bowel is not completely cleansed following an enema, the process can be repeated one or two more times. It is possible to undergo an enema in hospital, or to purchase an enema kit to carry out this process at home. The doctor will identify the most suitable option for the individual undergoing the colonoscopy.",Preparing for a colonoscopy: travel plans,"A person can undergo a colonoscopy as an outpatient in most cases, arriving at the clinic and returning home the same day.","However, people undergoing a colonoscopy are usually given sedatives to help them relax and to ensure that they are comfortable during the colonoscopy. In all cases where sedatives are used, it is advisable to arrange for a friend or family member to accompany the person having the colonoscopy to and from the hospital. This is because, in general, avoiding activities such as driving is recommended for a time after the use of sedatives. The timeframe of this period depends on the specific sedative used.",Colonoscopy preparation FAQs,"Q: Can I take routine medications whilst I am following my colonoscopy prep plan?
A: In the run up to a colonoscopy, a person should take their routine medication as normal. On the day of the procedure, if it is scheduled for the morning, avoid taking any medication unless specified by medical personnel, with the exception of blood pressure, heart and seizure medication. If a colonoscopy is scheduled for the afternoon, a person may take their routine medication, other than medications that they were instructed to avoid.","Good to know: Pain medication that is part of the NSAID group, like ibuprofen or aspirin, has historically not been recommended for use for several days or even more than a week before screenings where an additional procedure that causes bleeding is scheduled, such as a biopsy or polypectomy. This is due to the perceived increased risk of postoperative bleeding.[7]","However, some recent research suggests that there may not be a need to avoid all NSAIDs. The increased risk of bleeding needs to be examined by differentiating between the different types of NSAID medicine, as not all of them will increase the risk in all cases. NSAIDs should only be used on a doctor’s recommendation. They will recommend NSAIDs based on criteria including:[8]","
Whether continuing or stopping medications that may already be in use will be better for the affected person
The overall risk of bleeding complications during the procedure
Whether the risk of bleeding complications will be increased by the particular painkiller used
The risk of encountering a problem due to stopping the use of the painkiller, if used continuously.
","Always follow a doctor’s recommendations closely before taking any medications, including NSAIDs, before a colonoscopy.","Q: What can I do to reduce feelings of hunger during my colonoscopy prep?
A: It is normal to feel hungry whilst preparing for a colonoscopy, particularly in the liquid-only stage. It is important to follow the food intake plan in order to ensure that the prep is effective. Drinking sodas with a high sugar content can help to keep feelings of hunger at a minimum during this stage. Feelings of hunger are expected during this stage of prep and should not be a cause for concern; if hunger is excessively bothersome or results in feelings of pain, please consult the doctor.","Q: What do I do if colonoscopy prep medication makes me vomit?
A: If the laxative solution makes you feel nauseous, the best thing to do is to take a break from your intended dose schedule and leave a longer interval before taking the next dose. Missing a dose should be avoided, and it is therefore important to drink a replacement dose if vomiting occurs after drinking the solution. Other tips that may help reduce the likelihood of nausea and the risk of vomiting, and which are alternatives to drinking the solution straight, include:","
Drinking the prep solution in small sips
Sucking hard candy or a chilled lemon slice in between sips
Using a straw
Chilling the prep solution and/or drinking cold water alongside it
Discussing the use of a suitable anti-nausea medication with your healthcare provider, if nausea is expected
","Q: Can a colonoscopy detect colon cancer?**
A: Yes. A colonoscopy may be used as part of the screening process to detect colon cancer; a screening will be ordered for anybody at high risk of colon cancer or if it is suspected. When somebody is undergoing treatment for colon cancer, a colonoscopy may be scheduled periodically in order to monitor whether the treatment is effective.[9] Feeling unwell? If you are concerned about the health of you or a loved one, get a free symptom assessment with the Ada app.","Q: Are polyps removed during a colonoscopy?
A: During the colonoscopy procedure, it is possible to remove most polyps that are detected, in their entirety. This process is called polypectomy and can be performed using a range of different techniques, including removing the polyps with the help of an electrical current or cutting them off with a wire. In most cases, a person can undergo polypectomy during their colonoscopy as an outpatient.[10]","Q: How long do you poop after colonoscopy prep solution is taken?
A: Most colonoscopy prep solutions begin working two to three hours after they are consumed, although this varies between products. Another dose may be needed if bowel movements do not occur when expected. If bowel movements do not occur after an additional dose, consult your medical care team. An extended prep time may be needed, and the scan may need to be rescheduled if it is not possible to cleanse the colon in time.","Q: What are the colonoscopy prep guidelines for people with diabetes?
A: A person who is affected by diabetes and is due to undergo a colonoscopy will need to agree to a personalized colonoscopy prep plan with their doctor. In some cases, a person’s food intake plan and their normal dosing plan for taking insulin and other medications may need to be altered to accommodate colonoscopy prep. Their medical care team will work closely with them to ensure that their treatment regimen for diabetes is not disrupted in a way which could be harmful. People with diabetes who also have reduced kidney function will be prescribed a specialized laxative, rather than using generic colonoscopy prep products.[11]","Q: How long does diarrhea last after colonoscopy prep?
A: For some people, diarrhea continues for a short amount of time after the procedure. A small amount of leakage may occur in the hours after the scan, and people may therefore be recommended to wear protective clothing and/or use fluid absorbing pads in their underwear during this time. A person’s food choices in the immediate period after their colonoscopy are believed to influence the likelihood of experiencing diarrhea; it is recommended to avoid fried food, and to opt for a healthy, solid meal.[3]","Q: Is there such a thing as a colonoscopy bag?
A: Colonoscopy and colostomy sound similar, but they are different procedures, and there is no such thing as a colonoscopy bag.","A colonoscopy is a scan of the colorectal area, and does not involve a bag. In contrast, a colostomy, or bowel diversion, is a surgical procedure used to divert one end or a loop of the large intestine out through the wall of the abdomen or belly. An incision is made in the skin and through the abdominal wall to create an opening called a stoma, sometimes also known as an ostomy. Over this, a small pouch – known as a colostomy bag – is placed in order to collect excreted stool and other human waste."
,,,,,,,,,,What is a pressure ulcer?
,,,,,,,,,,What is a pressure ulcer?,"A pressure ulcer, also known as pressure sore or bed sore, is a wound caused by prolonged pressure on the skin. Typical locations for pressure sores are are the heels, ankles, hips and over the tailbone. Elderly people and bed- or wheelchair-bound are at risk of developing this condition. Symptoms may include pain in the area, red or purple skin, a break in the skin and, eventually, a wide-based sore which may get bigger over time. The diagnosis is usually easily based on the symptoms and appearance of the area of skin. Treatment involves taking steps to avoid pressure on the area, to keep the wound healthy and, if needed, to close the ulcer. If the wound is small, it may heal well, but large, complicated ulcers can take weeks to months to heal.",Risks,"Pressure on the skin is the main cause of pressure sores. A common cause is lying on a certain part of the body for a longer time, although some people develop this condition due to something (such as a device or rough surface) rubbing repeatedly on the the skin. This persistent pressure on one area causes breakdown of the upper layers of skin. If the pressure continues, it can also cause damage to the fat and muscle layers underneath. Normally, the pressure causes discomfort long before the skin becomes damaged, and people turn or move to relieve the discomfort. This condition occurs most commonly in people who are either unaware of pressure causing discomfort, or who are unable to turn themselves to relieve the pressure. Elderly people and those people who are bed-bound are most at risk of this condition. People who have had a spinal cord injury or another neurological condition which affects movement and sensation are also at increased risk. People with conditions which affect blood circulation, such as diabetes or chronic venous insufficiency may also develop pressure sores more easily.",Symptoms,"Typical symptoms include red or purple skin in the affected area, skin that is softer and thinner than the surrounding skin, a break in the skin, and an open sore with a wide base. These tend to occur in bony areas, such as over the tailbone, hips ankles and heels, although they can occur in other areas. There may be pain in the affected area, if the affected person does not have a loss of feeling which has contributed to the formation of the sore. If there is an infection, there may be pus in the sore, or it may have an unpleasant smell.",Diagnosis,"The diagnosis is usually easily made in a person at risk based on the location and appearance of the wound. If there is any sign of infection occurring in the sore, a swab may be taken in order to identify the bacteria causing the infection.",Treatment,"The treatment of pressure ulcer depends on the amount of damage to the skin and underlying tissues. Pressure damage with no broken skin and small ulcers can be healed by taking steps to avoid further pressure on the skin and allowing healing to occur. This involves frequent repositioning to spread pressure evenly over the body and using supportive surfaces, such as special mattresses or cushions. Pain relief may be required. If the wound is severe, surgical cleaning or a skin graft might be needed to repair the wound.",Prevention,People who are bed-bound should take care to turn or be turned frequently.

,,,,,,,,,,What is prostate cancer?
,,,,,,,,,,What is prostate cancer?,"Prostate cancer is a cancer of the prostate gland, a walnut-shaped gland which sits just below the bladder in males. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men. It tends to affect men over the age of 50, and becomes more common with age. Many people have no symptoms in the early stages, but when they occur, symptoms include difficulties with urination, weight loss and tiredness. As prostate cancer only causes symptoms as it progresses, screening (testing people without symptoms) can help to identify the cancer in the early stages. Treatment depends on the size of the cancer and whether it has spread at the time of diagnosis. This condition most often progresses slowly, and many people recover well with treatment.",Risks,"Cancer occurs when abnormal cells grow uncontrollably. These cells destroy the normal cells around them and can spread to other parts of the body. The prostate is a walnut-shaped gland that sits snugly underneath the bladder. It forms the first part of the urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the bladder) and produces secretions that make up semen. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men. It tends to affect men after the age of 50, and becomes more common with age. Men with a family member who has had prostate cancer have a slightly increased risk of this condition. Men who have African heritage also have a slightly higher risk than men from other backgrounds.",Symptoms,"There may be no symptoms in the early stages of prostate cancer. Urinary symptoms are common as the cancer progresses, and include difficulty beginning urination, a weak stream of urine and dribbling at the end of urination. As the cancer further progresses, some people may experience unintended weight loss, tiredness and general signs of illness may be present.",Diagnosis,"The diagnosis may be suspected based on the symptoms and a physical examination where a hard, knobbly prostate is felt. Blood tests and scans (ultrasound or CT scan) are also done. The diagnosis is confirmed when a small sample of the prostate (a biopsy) is taken and shows signs of prostate cancer.",Treatment,"There are multiple options for treating prostate cancer, depending on the size of the cancer and whether it has spread. The general health of the affected person also influences the choice of treatment. As prostate cancer often develops very slowly, a doctor may recommend regular check-ups with no other treatment for people with a small cancer, especially in older men or men in poor health. Prostate cancer which requires treatment often involves removing the prostate, along with hormonal therapy, radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or a combination of these. The treating doctor can give the best advice in individual cases. If the cancer is not curable, people with prostate cancer are offered treatments which aim to improve their symptoms and quality of life.",Prevention,Early detection is important. Regular check-ups and screening (testing people without symptoms) is helpful in preventing advanced cases of prostate cancer.
,,,,,,,,,,What is a prostatectomy?
,,,,,,,,,,What is a prostatectomy?,"A prostatectomy is a major procedure, carried out by a urological surgeon (urologist), in which all or part of the prostate gland is removed. A prostatectomy can be ordered by your doctor to treat prostate cancer and as part of treating some of the other types of cancer that can affect the pelvis.","A prostatectomy can often cure prostate cancer if it has not spread outside the prostate gland. Prostatectomies are also performed in the treatment of non-cancerous conditions affecting the prostate, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), when the prostate becomes enlarged and causes urinary problems,  and in rarer cases e.g. for prostatitis, an inflammation of the prostate.","There are several different methods of performing a prostatectomy. The method used depends on the reason the procedure is being performed. For example, a radical prostatectomy will be carried out as a treatment for malignant cancer. This type of prostatectomy involves the removal of the entire prostate gland as well as the vas deferens, the duct which conveys sperm from the testicals to the urethra, and the seminal vesicles, the glands which hold the liquid which mixes with sperm to make semen. However, a more benign condition, such as a prostate hyperplasia, would require a simple prostatectomy, in which only part of the prostate is removed.","Prostatectomies generally require general anesthesia, i.e. a kind of anesthesia where the person is asleep during the procedure and does not wake up till the surgery is entirely finished, and a hospital stay of two to three days on average, with a total recovery time of around one to two months. With appropriate aftercare, most people are able to resume physical activities as normal after around six weeks.",When and why is a prostatectomy performed?,"A prostatectomy is performed in order to treat a variety of conditions which can affect the prostate gland. The prostate gland is the size of a walnut and is located inside the male body, beneath the bladder and between the bladder and the penis. Women also have a gland which is equivalent to the prostate gland, commonly referred to in medicine as the paraurethral gland or Skene’s gland,  but they are much less likely to be affected by problems in this area than men.","In healthy males, the prostate gland produces prostate fluid, one of the main components of semen. The prostate gland also contains muscle fibres. During ejaculation, the prostate functions to push the semen into the urethra, the duct in the penis which conveys urine and semen out of the body.","Prostate problems most commonly develop in later life, predominantly affecting men of over 50 years of age. Problems, which affect the prostate and may be addressed by a prostatectomy, include prostate cancer, prostate enlargement and prostate inflammation (prostatitis).",Prostate cancer,"Prostate cancer is the second most common type of cancer in American males, after skin cancer, affecting around 1 in 7 men in the U.S. at some point during their lifetime.[1] Early-stage prostate cancer is typically asymptomatic and is usually detected during screening tests. When present, symptoms of more advanced prostate cancer may include:[2]","
Fatigue
Loss of appetite and weight loss
Inability to completely empty the bladder, i.e. urinary retention
Hematuria: blood in urine, which is visible to the eye or microscopically visible
Incontinence and erectile dysfunction
","Signs of late-stage prostate cancer may include pain in the lower back and/or bones, and lymphedema (localized swelling related to excess lymph-fluid-accumulation, due to blocked lymph drainage paths).","The survival chances for prostate cancer are more favourable than for many other types of cancer. This is because prostate cancer progresses comparatively slowly, so it is often possible to identify and treat the condition before it reaches a critical stage of advancement. In addition to prostate cancer, a prostatectomy may also be carried out to treat or manage other cancers that affect the pelvis, such as bladder cancer and rectal cancer.",Benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH),Benign prostate hyperplasia is also referred to as prostate enlargement.[3],"Prostate enlargement is unrelated to cancer, and the likelihood of developing prostate cancer is not increased by having this condition. The enlargement of the prostate occurs as men age, and the prostate can grow to the extent that it begins to exert pressure on the urethra. This can cause discomfort and precipitate problems within the urinary system, including:[4]","
Urinary urgency: A strong urge or perceived need to urinate, which may be accompanied by pain and/or fear of urine leakage.
Urinary frequency: The need to urinate frequently, usually in small quantities, during the night (nocturia) and day.
Hematuria: Blood may be present in urine. This is due to the fact that the enlargement of the prostate gland, that occurs during BPH, can increase the frequency of breakages in the blood vessels, particularly after physical activity. This often results in recurrent (repeating) episodes of hematuria, until BPH is treated.
","Problems associated with BPH can sometimes be managed by taking medication which reduces the size of the prostate and helps to relax the muscles in and around the bladder. In some cases, however, a prostatectomy is necessary in order to relieve the symptoms.",Prostatitis,"This is a condition in which the prostate gland becomes swollen and inflamed. Prostatitis often occurs as the result of a bacterial infection, caused by bacteria which enter via the bladder or urethra and then infect the prostate. The symptoms of prostatitis include difficulties urinating or starting to urinate, pain which occurs specifically when ejaculating and/or in the perineum (the area between the scrotum and the anus) and generalized pain in the genitals, buttocks and pelvis.","Prostatitis can often be managed or treated using medication to shrink the prostate gland, painkillers and anti-inflammatory medication called alpha-blockers. In chronic cases of prostatitis, where the symptoms cannot be managed or treated by medication, the prostate may be removed by a special type of prostatectomy called a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).",Types of prostatectomy,"There are several different methods for performing a prostatectomy and several different types of prostatectomy, each appropriate to the treatment or management of different prostate-related conditions.",The main types of prostatectomy are:,"
Radical prostatectomy
Nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy
Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP)
","Before an individual undergoes the procedure, their urologist will discuss the intended route of surgery, and they will decide together on the best method. It is always important to find out whether or not the prostatectomy is intended to be nerve-sparing, an approach which ideally preserves erections and sexual function.",Radical prostatectomy,"This type of operation is generally performed on people who are affected by prostate cancer. It involves removing the prostate gland in its entirety. The surgeon may also remove the surrounding tissues, lymph nodes (small pieces of tissue which should filter and clear liquid waste called lymph) and the seminal vesicles.",Nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy,"Prostatectomies can compromise a man’s ability to produce or sustain an erection. A nerve-sparing prostatectomy is an innovation on the usual surgical procedure for a radical prostatectomy, in which the surgeon takes special care to spare the two cavernous nerve sheaths. These are clusters of nerves which lie to the sides of the prostate gland. Their function in healthy males is to produce erections.[5]","In nerve-sparing radical prostatectomies, the surgeon will stimulate the nerves electrically and measure erectile functionality using a machine called a penile plethysmograph[5] which measures the blood flow to the penis. This helps the surgeon to perform the surgery without cutting the nerves responsible for erectile function.",It is not always possible to carry out a nerve-sparing prostatectomy successfully. The surgeon’s technical skills and experience will greatly impact the chances of preserving erectile function. Also crucial to the success of this procedure are the age and previous erectile abilities of the male undergoing the procedure.,Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP),"TURP is predominantly carried out on people who are affected by benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), a non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate. By removing parts of the prostate that press on the urethra, TURP may reduce problems related to urination.","This operation is specifically designed to remove the inner part of the prostate which surrounds the urethra. Rather than cutting the skin to perform the operation, the urologist will insert an instrument called a resectoscope into the penis through the tip and extract the relevant tissue by burning it off with an electrical current or vaporizing it.","Unlike BPH, it is not possible to cure prostate cancer using the TURP procedure. However, the operation is sometimes recommended for men who are experiencing the advanced stages of prostate cancer.",Surgical methods for performing a prostatectomy,"Traditionally, prostatectomies are carried out by open surgery, in which the surgeon makes a single, long incision in the skin and then removes the prostate and any other required surrounding tissues. However, due to technological advancements, it has become possible to carry out a prostatectomy using less invasive methods such as laparoscopic surgery (keyhole surgery).","An advantage of using the newer, less invasive surgical techniques is that they can often result in shorter postoperative (after surgery) recovery times. In cases, where only part of the prostate is to be removed, it is possible to perform the procedure without cutting into the surrounding skin at all. For example, a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) can be performed by inserting a thin tube called a resectoscope into the bladder through the urethra to remove the prostate tissue.",Open surgery,A radical prostatectomy can be performed using open surgery. This involves the surgeon making an incision into the lower belly in order to reach the prostate. This is called a retropublic approach. A retropubic radical prostatectomy is the most commonly performed type of prostatectomy.,It is also possible to perform a prostatectomy through an incision made into the perineum (area between the scrotum and the anus). This is called a perineal approach and is associated with a shorter recovery time than the retropubic approach.[6],Laparoscopic prostatectomy (keyhole surgery),"This surgical technique is also called bandaid surgery or minimally invasive surgery (MIS). It is a modern method of performing operations through small incisions in the body, near the surgery site. One of the instruments will feature a video camera, which facilitates the surgeon seeing inside the body. Laparoscopic prostatectomies can usually be performed through incisions no bigger than 0.5 to 1.5 cm, and surgeons can perform this type of surgery by hand.",Robotic prostatectomy,"Robotic prostatectomies are a type of laparoscopic prostatectomy. Rather than performing the operation by hand, a robotic arm is used to hold the surgical tools. This kind of prostatectomy ideally offers several advantages over the traditional laparoscopic prostatectomies, including:","
Clinically superior results
Fewer complications
Faster recovery
Minimal scarring
",Preparing for a prostatectomy,"The time between a prostate condition being diagnosed and a prostatectomy being scheduled varies depending on the individual and the advancement of their specific condition. In cases where a prostatectomy is being carried out because of prostate cancer, there is often an interval of six or more weeks between the diagnosis – which involves taking a biopsy – and the scheduling of the operation. This is to allow any inflammation, that has occurred as a result of the biopsy, to heal.",These actions and forward-planning measures are helpful in preparing to undergo a prostatectomy:,"Kegel exercises: Schedule an appointment to learn Kegel exercises before the operation. These strengthen the muscles around the bladder (pelvic floor muscles) and will assist the process of regaining normal urinary function after the catheter, which is regularly administered after surgery, is removed. They should be practiced before and after prostate surgery.","Hospital stay: A prostatectomy is an inpatient procedure that will require a hospital stay of two to three days, in general, after which it is possible to return home. Preparing for this, logistically and emotionally, will make this period run as smoothly as possible.","Time off work: Recovery time after a prostatectomy is variable, but it will usually be necessary to book up to several weeks off work. Some people return to non-physical work such as a desk job after only a few days. However, it can take up to six weeks or, in rare cases, even longer to recover sufficiently to return to work after open prostate surgery. The recovery time for returning to work after a laparoscopic prostatectomy is usually shorter, often between two and three weeks.","Avoid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Certain painkillers, such as aspirin and ibuprofen, may affect blood clotting. Using them before surgery can result in excessive bleeding. If needed, acetaminophen (Tylenol or Paracetamol) may be suitable to prevent minor aches and pains. However, no painkiller products should be used in the period before surgery, without first consulting a doctor to check that they are suitable.",These medicines and dietary modifications are helpful preparations for the day before the surgery is due to take place:,"Bowel preparation: In order for the surgery to be performed properly, it is vital that the bowel is empty and clean. The doctor will prescribe a bowel preparation to be taken the day before the surgery in order to help remove waste from the area.","Avoid solid food: To prevent the body from creating more feces and compromising the cleanliness of the bowel, it is important to avoid solid food for the day before the surgery and ingest only clear liquids.","Avoid eating or drinking on the day of the surgery: Because general anaesthetic will be used, it is important to avoid ingesting anything before the surgery takes place. People are usually recommended to avoid eating after midnight the night before the surgery takes place, but, in each case, always follow the specific guidelines given by the surgeon or anesthesiologist.",During the procedure,"Prostatectomies, depending on the type itself, usually take about one or two, and, in rarer cases, for more complicated open radical prostatectomies, three hours for the urologist to perform, with the whole surgical procedure, including sedation and waking up, usually lasting two to four hours in total.","Immediately after the surgery, a temporary subrapubic catheter (a thin tube) is inserted through the penis or, alternatively, through an incision in the abdomen, in order to streamline the process of urination during recovery. The catheter serves to prevent urine coming into contact with the healing area and often stays in place for about 7 days, but this may also vary greatly, depending on the procedure performed or the patient’s specific recovery progress.",Postoperative care and recovery,"The duration of time people stay in hospital after their prostatectomy varies, though it will usually be between two and three days. It is possible, particularly if the procedure was a laparoscopic prostatectomy, to recover sufficiently to return to work after a period of two to three weeks. Nearly everybody who undergoes a prostatectomy recovers sufficiently to return to work after six weeks.","As soon as the operation is complete, and while the person undergoing the procedure is still in the operating room, a temporary suprapubic catheter will be inserted to assist them in urinating during the immediate recovery process. A suprapubic catheter is a hollow, flexible tube which is inserted into the bladder through an incision in the stomach above the navel (tummy button). The catheter is left in place for one or two weeks and helps drain the urine from the bladder whilst the area, which has undergone surgery, is healing. In some cases, instead of the suprapubic catheter, a transurethral catheter leading from the exit of the urethra at the tip of the penis to the bladder may be inserted.","People who have undergone a prostatectomy should expect to see a small amount of postoperative bleeding from the tip of the penis after the catheter has been removed; this is during urination in the days after the surgery and lasts for up to a maximum of 6 weeks after surgery. While the catheter is still in place, some blood and/or blood-like debris are likely to be visible in the urine collection system; this is normal, especially during the first few days after surgery.","In addition to the catheter, a range of devices and techniques are recommended to promote healing during the immediate recovery period:","Donut cushion: Postoperative pain when sitting can be avoided by using a circular cushion with a hole in the middle, and which is called a donut cushion; this allows the wearer to sit down without putting pressure on the surgery site.","Drinking plenty of water: This will help ensure that the urinary system functions as healthily as possible while it is recovering from surgery and will also keep the body hydrated. Staying hydrated is also necessary, because the affected person will be using stool softener in the postoperative period to avoid constipation.","Kegel exercises: These should be practiced before and after the operation to keep the pelvic floor muscles, which control the bladder and urine flow, operational as directed by a doctor. The three areas which are strengthened by Kegel exercises are the bladder which holds the urine, the pubococcygeus muscle which supports the bladder and rectum, and the sphincter urethrae, which helps open and close the urethra. Kegel exercises can help a person to recover from the incontinence caused by undergoing a prostatectomy, which is temporary in most cases.","Limiting other physical activity: Other than the Kegel exercises, it is advisable to limit other physical exercise and heavy lifting during the recovery period. Walking around gently at intervals during the day is recommended, however, to prevent blood clots forming in the groin and legs.","Sexual activity: Urologists advise people who have undergone a prostatectomy to explore the resumption of sexual activity as soon as they feel ready. Even if it is not immediately possible to produce an erection sufficient for performing full sexual intercourse, stimulating the area will help the nerves and muscles involved in producing an erection become used to doing so. Men who have had a successful nerve-sparing prostatectomy tend to recover their erectile abilities quickly. For men who have had a non-nerve-sparing or unsuccessful nerve-sparing prostatectomy, the process of regaining erectile function can take longer. Medications and/or devices can be prescribed in these cases. In the rare event of a prostatectomy resulting in chronic impotence, surgical procedures such as the insertion of penile implants can help.","Pain medication: Most people will experience some pain in and around the area which has undergone surgery, as well as some pain related to wearing the catheter. The doctor will prescribe suitable painkillers and give advice on how frequently to redose.",Stool softeners: It is normal to be affected by constipation after undergoing surgery. The doctor will prescribe a suitable stool softener to help maintain healthy bowel function.,Urination and incontinence in the postoperative period,"People who have undergone a prostatectomy will be taught how to operate the catheter before they leave hospital after the operation. The operation of most catheters is relatively similar and involves collecting the urine in a drainage bag, which can then be emptied into the lavatory. The drainage bag must be changed at appropriate intervals.","All men normally experience some level of incontinence (leakage of urine) after the catheter has been removed, particularly after involuntary bodily actions such as sneezing or laughing. It is also common to experience sudden impulses to urinate while the catheter is in place. This is called a bladder spasm. Bladder spasms should ideally not be particularly painful or occur very often. Therefore, it is wise to consult the doctor if they occur frequently enough to be bothersome or are accompanied by acute pain.","For most men, urinary problems are temporary and are effectively resolved by practicing pelvic floor and Kegel exercises regularly, as recommended by the doctor. Pads should be worn whilst urinary leakage is occurring and changed throughout the day as needed.","Very rarely, men who have undergone a prostatectomy develop a permanent kind of urinary incontinence called chronic urinary incontinence. If urinary incontinence remains a problem after the catheter has been removed, further surgical procedures will be considered to treat the incontinence. For example, the insertion of an artificial urinary sphincter, a device which regulates the release of urine from the bladder, may need to be considered as an option.",Penile rehabilitation (regaining erectile function),"All prostate surgery procedures disrupt the nerves and blood vessels that control the way erections form. For this reason, all prostatectomies will compromise erectile function, at least initially. Up to 50 percent of men who have had a successful nerve-sparing procedure, i.e. the nerves were left untouched as planned during the procedure, regain their pre-prostatectomy (before surgery) erectile functionality within one year. For men, who have not had nerve-sparing procedures, it is still possible to recover most or the entire extent of their pre-treatment erectile capability.","Prostate surgery can alter the sensation of the male orgasm. In some men, the orgasm ceases to be as intensely pleasurable or ceases to be pleasurable at all. This change in sensation is principally caused by the fact that, in radical prostatectomies, both the glands which make seminal fluid and the vas deferens (the sperm ducts) are no longer operational, so the male orgasm must occur without the ejaculation of semen. Sometimes, especially common after TURP surgery, the semen may still be ejected,  will not, however, leave the body, but be transported into the bladder; this is called retrograde ejaculation.","Occasionally, men who have undergone a prostatectomy report experiencing pain when orgasming after they have recovered. It is possible for the pain – which usually affects the perineum and pelvis – to occur either occasionally, at regular intervals or every time the affected person engages in sexual intercourse. The incomplete removal of the seminal vesicles during the prostatectomy procedure is thought to be a principal cause of postoperative pain on orgasming.[7]","Factors, which affect the chances of regaining one’s erectile functionality after the procedure, include:","
The skill of the urologist: The greater their experience and success rate at preserving sexual function, the more likely a given procedure is to conclude with this outcome.
Age: Younger men are more likely than older men to keep or regain their erectile abilities.
Previous sexual profile: The greater a man’s virility and ability to produce erections before the procedure, the more likely he is to keep or regain it after the procedure.
","Doctors will usually encourage postoperative patients to resume sexual activity as soon as the catheter is removed in order to preserve their penile function. The sooner after surgery a man begins exploring his erectile abilities, the more likely he is to regain most or all of his normal sexual functionality. This process is called penile rehabilitation.[8]",The success of penile rehabilitation depends foremost on whether or not a man has undergone a nerve-sparing prostatectomy. Non nerve-sparing prostatectomies and unsuccessful nerve-sparing prostatectomies damage the two bundles of nerves associated with producing erections.,"If both bundles of nerves are sufficiently damaged, it may no longer be possible for a man to have spontaneous erections without the aid of devices or medications that assist the bodily process in cases when it can no longer happen naturally. However, in cases where spontaneous erections are no longer possible, there are several possible treatment options which may help with overcoming erectile dysfunction after a prostatectomy.",Treatment options for  erectile dysfunction after prostatectomy include:,Topical medication,"The best medication for assisting erectile function is Alprostadil, a man-made version of prostaglandin E1, a substance naturally made in the body to help produce erections. Five to ten minutes before sexual activity takes place, this medication can be applied by injection (brand name Caverject) into a certain part of the penis, as a suppository into the tip of the penis (brand name MUSE), or applied as a cream.","Alprostadil has significantly fewer and less severe side effects than most oral medications which can be used to treat erectile dysfunction. It works by widening the blood vessels and increasing the blood flow to the penis, causing an erection. If side effects occur, these are usually non-serious and are limited to prolonged erections, pain and dizziness. Another advantage of Alprostadil is that the dosage can be adjusted to to determine the duration of an erection.","The cream version of alprostadil ‒ marketed as Vitaros ‒ is the newest form of this medication.[9] It comes in a single-use container with a plunger, barrel and protective cap, containing either 200 or 300 micrograms of alprostadil in 100 mg of cream.[10] The appropriate dose strength for each person is decided in consultation with their doctor.",Storage and application guidelines for Vitaros include:[11],"
Vitaros should be stored in the fridge, but can be taken out before use in order to reach room temperature, for ease of application. If it is taken directly out of the fridge, it may need to be warmed up for use by massaging the tube in one’s hands.
It is best to urinate before applying Vitaros. Urination after application will result in cream being expelled from the urethra, lessening its erectile effects.
Each tube of Vitaros contains the right amount of medication for a single dose, which should be applied, with clean hands and in full to the penis, by injecting it into the urethra, using the single-use applicator pump provided. The penis should then be kept upright for 30 seconds so that the cream can be absorbed. Any leftover cream can be rubbed in around the tip of the penis. Hands should be washed after application.
Vitaros will usually take effect in 5-30 minutes after application. It is not an aphrodisiac, and sexual stimulation will therefore be necessary to achieve an erection. For most people, the effects last between one and two hours. A full, warm sensation in the penis is not a cause for concern, and may remain for several hours after use.
",Vitaros should not be used more than once within any 24 hour period. A person should not exceed three doses in a week.[11],Oral medication,"If only one set of the nerve bundles that control erections has been damaged, it is possible to stimulate erections using pharmaceuticals such as sildenafil, commonly known as Viagra, vardenafil and tadalafil. These medications are taken orally, and they work by counteracting Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5), a chemical naturally occurring in the body, thereby increasing blood flow to the penis during sexual stimulation.","PDE5 inhibitors are associated with several side effects including headaches, a runny nose, hot flushes, an upset stomach and light sensitivity. In some cases, they can cause more severe and permanent vision problems, such as blindness.","These medications are known to react with nitrate-containing drugs used to treat heart disease, so it is important to discuss possible interactions with the doctor in cases where PDE5 inhibitors may be taken in combination with other medications, especially heart medications.",Vacuum devices,"These are mechanical pumps which cause an erection by drawing blood into the penis when the air is sucked out of the pump, after it has been placed over the penis. Erections created with the use of a vacuum device require a band to be applied to the base of the penis to trap the blood for the duration of the intercouse. The band can then be removed afterwards.",Implants,"For people for whom no other treatments for post-prostatectomy erectile dysfunction are effective, implants may help. These can be surgically inserted into the penis, which requires an operation.",Risks and side-effects,"As with any major surgical procedure, a prostatectomy carries certain risks and possible side effects. These include problems that can occur immediately after the surgery, such as an allergic reaction to substances in the anaesthetic medication, as well as problems which can occur later on. For instance, the formation of blood clots or infections developing near the surgery site.",Complications which can arise from the procedure can include:,Incontinence,"All prostatectomies disrupt the normal flow of urine from the bladder and out of the penis through the urethra. For this reason, everybody who undergoes a prostatectomy will experience a period when they have difficulties controlling the speed and flow of their urination in the immediate aftermath of the procedure.","Most men regain their bladder control after several weeks or months after the catheter is removed, particularly in cases when there are no other complications and Kegel exercises are practiced as recommended. Some people do not recover their bladder control, this is called continuous incontinence, which may be treated with further surgery and/or by using devices to regulate the flow of urine and control the bladder, such as an artificial sphincter.",Bleeding after the surgery,"Because all prostatectomies involve cutting internal tissue, and, in most cases, also external tissue, there is the potential for problematic bleeding to occur after the procedure has been performed. It is important to consult the doctor as soon as possible if  bleeding, especially fresh blood occurs beyond the initial recovery period (see passage above) or if the bleeding is very strong in the initial period. Either circumstance may indicate a hemorrhage, and should therefore should be investigated.[12]","If bleeding does continue after the catheter is removed, then it might be a sign of internal bleeding after surgery, and medical attention should be sought immediately.",Blood clots,"Blood clots that develop after prostate surgery tend to form in the legs or less commonly the groin area. Loose blood clots can then cause pulmonary embolism, a life-threatening condition in which the blood clot travels to the lungs and causes a blockage in the pulmonary artery, the blood vessel which carries the blood from the heart to the lungs. Walking around and consistently practicing pelvic floor exercises in the initial recovery period is an effective way to prevent clots from forming.",Damage to nearby organs,"This can occur in the event of a surgical error. Urologists are careful to perform the procedure as precisely as possible so as to minimise the risk of causing damage to the surrounding area. However, in rare cases, injury to the surrounding tissue and organs can still be sustained.",Adverse reactions to the anesthesia,"If a person has a history of swelling of the face or generalised itching, it is important to inform the anaesthetist before the procedure because,  although allergic reactions to anaesthesia can be mild, involving only wheezing or some skin irritation, it is also possible to experience an anaphylactic response which can be life-threatening.","Somebody suffering from an allergic reaction to an anaesthetic may display signs like breathing difficulties, low blood pressure, rashes, hives and swollen skin around the eyes or mouth and throat. It is possible to perform tests prior to the surgery to identify which chemicals trigger an allergic reaction and if necessary an appropriate alternative anaesthetic solution can then be chosen.[13]","Other adverse reactions, such a muscle soreness, a sore throat from the breathing tube or nausea and vomiting after the surgery are a lot more common than allergic reactions. Around 10 percent of people will experience some kind of adverse reaction to anaesthetic drugs[14], and anaesthetists are trained to recognise and treat reactions as and when they occur during or after surgery.",Infections at the surgery site,"The parts of the body which are most likely to be infected after surgery are located in the abdomen (the belly). Infections after prostate surgery are usually due to the intestine being injured during surgery, which is more common in cases where the prostatectomy has been carried out by keyhole surgery than when an open approach has been used.",Lower-body lymphedema,"This is a rare complication of removing the lymph nodes around the prostate during prostate surgery. Removing any of the body’s lymph nodes can affect the lymphatic system. Functioning normally, the lymph nodes act as a drain for lymph fluid which circulates around the body. When this protein-rich fluid cannot drain out through the lymph nodes, it can build up and stagnate in the area of the body where the lymph nodes were removed, and infection-causing bacteria can develop.[15]",Common symptoms of lymphedema after prostatectomy include:[15][16],"
Heaviness and achiness in the genital area or legs
Reddening of the skin in the genital area or legs
Changes in the size and shape of the legs
Swollen skin
Reduced flexibility
","Always consult a doctor if lymphedema is suspected. If lymphedema is left untreated, the growing pool of undrained lymph can spread to surrounding areas of the body, such as the back and legs.[17] Treatment for lymphedema focuses on redistributing this buildup of lymph within the body, so that it can be drained by other, functioning, lymph nodes. This may involve:[18]","
Applying a compression system, such as a special bandage, to the affected area
Manual lymph drainage, a specific type of massage performed by a doctor or occupational therapist
Stretching exercises
Deep breathing exercises
A manual pump to use at home
",Pelvic lymphocele,"Pelvic lymphocele is a possible complication of prostate surgery, most commonly associated with undergoing a radical prostatectomy. A lymphocele occurs when the local lymphatic system is compromised due to surgery as a result of which, a buildup of lymph drains into a nearby cavity, rather than being drained from the area where the lymph nodes were removed.[19]","When lymphocele occurs after prostate surgery, the buildup of lymph is usually found in the retroperitoneal space, i.e. behind the membrane that lines the abdominal cavity and covers the abdominal organs. Lymphocele can be symptomless, and can resolve spontaneously, without the need for treatment.","When symptoms of lymphocele do occur, they may include:","
Abdominal pain
A sensation of fullness
Reddened or swollen skin
Constipation
Urinary urgency or the need to urinate frequently
Edema (swelling) of the genitals and/or legs
","Seek prompt medical attention if symptoms of lymphocele are present. The presence of symptoms indicates that the lymphocele has grown to a size, at which treatment will be required in order to remove it. Left untreated, lymphocele can cause other problems to develop, including obstruction of the urinary tract, obstruction of the blood flow to the surgery site and/or compression of nearby blood vessels, which will slow down the post-surgical healing process.","In addition to a physical examination, an ultrasound or CT scan may be carried out in order to diagnose lymphocele. Treatment for symptomatic lymphocele may involve:[20]","Marsupialization: This is a surgical technique which involves cutting a slit into the area occupied by the lymphocele and suturing it into an open position, creating a pouch shape and thereby allowing the buildup of lymph to drain freely out of the previously enclosed space. It is usually carried out as an outpatient procedure. Laparoscopic marsupialization has recently become the first line treatment for pelvic lymphocele, although it is also possible to perform marsupialization via open surgery. In laparoscopic marsupialization, a very small incision is made in the skin near the lymphocele; marsupialization can then be carried out robotically, using image guidance.[21]","Percutaneous drainage: This procedure is carried out under local anesthetic and takes around one hour to perform. A small incision will be made in the skin near the site of the lymphocele. Doctors will use image guidance to insert a needle attached to a catheter into the lymphocele, and the fluid will then be drained out of the body, via the catheter, into a drainage bag.[22]",Inguinal hernia,"Performing surgery other than TURP on the prostate weakens the layers of pelvic tissue and muscle tissue of the lower belly where the incision was made. This can cause internal parts of the body, such as parts of the intestine, to gravitate from their normal location, causing pain and a distinctive bulge to form in the groin area. Men are ten times more likely to experience an inguinal hernia than women[23], and their chances of developing the condition later on are significantly increased by having undergone an open surgery prostatectomy.",Other complications,"Good to know: An additional, less common, complication of prostate surgery is Peyronie's disease. This condition causes a shortening and curvature of the penis and primarily affects men in their fifth or sixth decade of life. Peyronie’s disease shares this characteristic with most prostate-related conditions that require a prostatectomy, but there is little evidence to support or refute the idea that they are necessarily linked.[24]","However, the shortening of the urethra, that can occur as a result of a prostatectomy, can cause the penis to shorten and curve in a manner that is hard to distinguish or is even indistinguishable from the curvature caused by Peyronie’s disease.",Prostatectomy FAQs,"Q: Can a prostatectomy cause a change in penis length?
A: Yes. It is very common for the penis length to decrease after prostate surgery, due to the fact that a portion of the urethra is often removed with the prostate. Radical prostatectomies generally cause the greatest decrease in penis length. In most cases, the length of the penis is most diminished immediately after the procedure and the difference between its postoperative length and original length decreases as the person recovers.[25]","Q: Can a prostatectomy cause loss of fertility?
A: Radical prostatectomies are the type most commonly associated with a loss of fertility. This is because they involve cutting and/or removing the vas deferens, meaning that the sperm no longer have a conduit to travel from the testicles and out of the body in seminal fluid. A man, who has had a radical prostatectomy, can no longer father a child naturally, but can choose to save (bank) his sperm for future use before the operation.[26] It is important to talk to the doctor before the procedure is carried out and make arrangements if this is needed.","Q: Is it possible to drive a car during the recovery period from a prostatectomy?
A: One should avoid driving completely whilst the catheter is in place. After the catheter is removed, it is nevertheless advisable to avoid certain activities such as driving for two to four weeks after the operation and to confirm with one’s doctor that one is fit to resume them on a follow-up visit.","Q: What precautions should I take to keep clean and promote healing while the temporary catheter is in place and after its removal?
A: The subrapubic or transurethral cathether is a thin, flexible tube; a temporary device which is inserted after prostate surgery in order to streamline urination during recovery. It is usually worn for around one or two weeks, during which time a person should keep the surrounding area as clean and dry as possible. This can be achieved by washing the rest of the body with a sponge or flannel, rather than bathing or showering fully. Drinking plenty of water is advised in order to keep the urinary system functioning normally.","It is not unusual to experience some pain and/or irritation in the urethral area due to the presence of a transurethral catheter or some discomfort in the lower belly area if a suprapubic catheter is used. Suitable painkillers to take during the recovery process will be recommended by one’s doctor, and any irritation should clear up on its own once the catheter is removed. Some people may experience temporary urinary incontinence after the removal of the catheter. If this occurs, urinary pads should be worn until normal urinary function is restored."
,,,,,,,,,,What is a pulmonary embolism?
,,,,,,,,,,What is a pulmonary embolism?,"Pulmonary embolism is a medical condition in which the arteries (the large blood vessels) in the lungs are blocked by a blood clot, an air bubble or by fat. The most common cause is a blood clot traveling from the legs to the lungs, and there are multiple possible causes for this. The most common symptoms are shortness of breath and a chest pain which is gets worse when taking deep breaths. Treatment includes removing the blockage, which is often done with blood-thinning medications which dissolve the blood clot. If the person is diagnosed and treated quickly, the outcome after pulmonary embolism is good.",Risks,"A embolus is an object which is not dissolved in the blood and which travels through the blood vessels. These tend to travel until the blood vessels become too small for it to travel further. This blocks the blood vessel, which may cause the tissues at the end of the blood vessels to become starved of oxygen and nutrients. A pulmonary embolus the medical term for when this occurs in the lungs. It most commonly occurs as a result of a blood clot which starts in the legs and travels to the lungs, but there are several less common causes, such as a big air bubble in the blood, or fat entering the bloodstream. This condition is common, and tends to affect older adults more commonly than younger people. Things which encourage blood clots to form in the legs increase the risk of this condition. This includes smoking, prolonged periods of sitting or lying and certain medical conditions, especially cancer, vasculitis, and conditions which cause the blood to clot easily (antiphospholipid syndrome). People who have recently had a major surgery are also at increased risk of this condition. Pregnant women and women who take the birth control pill have a higher risk of developing a pulmonary embolism.",Symptoms,"The typical symptoms of a pulmonary embolus are shortness of breath and a chest pain which gets worse when taking deep breaths. Other symptoms may include a cough, dizziness, a blue tinge to the skin and a loss of consciousness. People who have a blood clot in the leg may also have redness and swelling of the leg with the clot.",Diagnosis,"A pulmonary embolus may be suspected based on the symptoms and physical examination, but further tests are usually needed to confirm the diagnosis. This may include blood tests and scans of the chest and lungs.",Treatment,"A pulmonary embolism is often medical emergency. Treatment involves making sure that the affected person is stable, removing the cause, and taking steps to prevent future clots. If the cause is a blood clot, this requires medications to thin the blood and dissolve the clot. Other causes may require emergency surgery, but this is rare. People who are at risk of future blood clots and pulmonary embolus may need to take long-term blood thinning medications. If this is not an option, placing a filter in the big blood vessel that goes from the legs to the heart and lungs helps to prevent future clots. This is called an inferior vena cave (the big blood vessel) filter.",Prevention,"Taking steps to prevent blood clots in the legs, especially in people who are known to be at risk, can help to avoid pulmonary embolism. This may involve wearing stockings that help blood flow, or avoiding long periods of lying or sitting."
,,,,,,,,,,What is reactive arthritis?
,,,,,,,,,,What is reactive arthritis?,"Reactive arthritis (ReA), formerly known as Reiter’s syndrome, Reiter’s disease or Reiter’s arthritis, is a relatively short-lived form of arthritis, more common in younger people than other forms of arthritis.","Reactive arthritis develops as a reaction to certain bacterial infections, most often genital tract or bowel infections. Generally following the initial bacterial infection after one to four weeks, and lasting up to about six months, ReA varies widely in severity and normally occurs as an isolated illness with no further problems. However, some people will experience repeated bouts in response to further infections, and a few will develop ongoing arthritis.[1]",Symptoms,"The symptoms of reactive arthritis (ReA) can range from mild to severe. They often appear suddenly and tend to last for several months, fluctuating in severity during that time. They normally stop within about six months and include:[1][2]","
Asymmetric oligoarthritis, inflammation of large, weight-bearing joints
Conjunctivitis, eye pain and redness
Urethritis, painful urination)
Genital discharge
Keratoderma blennorhagicum, scaly rash on the palms or soles of feet
Diarrhea
Mouth ulcers
Balanitis, sore rash on end of penis
Weight loss
Fever
",Want to know whether you experiencing symptoms of reactive arthritis? Try the Ada app for a free assessment.,Causes,"Reactive arthritis (ReA) is an inflammatory disease of the joints that occurs in reaction to an infection occurring in another part of the body. Typically, reactive arthritis is triggered by chlamydia, but can also be triggered by other infections, often from food poisoning. The triggering infection may have been so mild as to have gone unnoticed.","ReA is not an infection of the joints[3], and the severity of the initial infection is not related to the severity of the ensuing arthritis.","It is not known exactly why these symptoms develop outside areas of the body that are or were infected. Reactive arthritis is thought to be an autoimmune disorder, in which fragments of dead bacteria or viruses can remain in the body after infection, to be carried through the bloodstream and deposited in the joint linings. In some cases, this may trigger the immune system to react by attacking healthy tissue, causing inflammation.[4]",Risk factors,Reactive arthritis (ReA) is always brought on by an infection elsewhere in the body. The most common infections to trigger reactive arthritis are:[5],"Urethritis. This is an infection of the urethra, the tube which passes urine from the bladder. Often this is caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI), most commonly chlamydia.","Gastroenteritis. Infection of the gut, commonly from food poisoning, can trigger ReA, such as shigella, salmonella, campylobacter and yersinia.","Chlamydia pneumoniae. These bacteria, which can cause a cough or lung infection, are often a trigger.","Other infections, including viral infections, such as glandular fever or flu, can also trigger reactive arthritis.",It is not known exactly what predisposes a person to develop ReA in response to infection. Certain factors that are more common in people with the condition include being:,"
Aged roughly 20 to 40 years old
Male
White
A carrier of the HLA-B27 gene
HIV positive
",Diagnosis,"Diagnosis is generally done after referral to a rheumatologist, which is a type of doctor specializing in inflammation and pain in the joints, muscles, or fibrous tissue.","Unlike other types of arthritis, there is no specific test which can diagnose reactive arthritis. Instead, a rheumatologist must gather information to rule out other conditions and home in on the cause of a patient’s symptoms. Diagnosis may be gathered from a combination of reported medical history and symptoms, physical exam, laboratory tests and medical imaging. The Ada app can also help you find out if a reactive arthritis diagnosis is likely. Try a free symptom assessment.",Interview and physical exam,"It is important that a person let their doctor know about recent or ongoing infections. They should also describe joint pain and other symptoms, as well as how long they have been going on for.","A doctor will look for signs of reactive arthritis, such as swollen joints, swollen fingers and toes, tender areas, and skin and eye inflammation, and may check the genitals to note any symptoms of sexually transmitted infection, such as rashes, sores or abnormal discharge.",Laboratory tests,"If a doctor suspects reactive arthritis, one or more tests may be done to help with making a diagnosis by:[6][7][8]","Confirming infection. After infection, antibodies remain in the blood which may be picked up by a blood test. However, such tests may not always be accurate or easy to interpret. Ongoing infection can be detected with urine and stool samples, genital swabs and throat swabs.","Measuring inflammatory markers. Abnormally high levels of certain markers in the blood would support a diagnosis that symptoms are caused by an inflammatory condition, such as reactive arthritis. Inflammatory markers which may be detected by a blood test include:","
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR or sed rate)
C-reactive protein (CRP)
",Testing for the HLA-B27 gene. People who carry a gene called HLA-B27 are more likely to develop reactive arthritis. This gene can be detected with a blood test.,"Ruling out other conditions. Arthrocentesis, i.e. drawing fluid from an affected joint with a needle, can rule out certain other conditions as the cause of symptoms, such as gout. Reactive arthritis can be ruled out if a blood test finds the presence of antibodies linked with other conditions, such as rheumatoid factor, which indicates rheumatoid arthritis, and anti-nuclear antibodies (ANAs), which indicates lupus.[9]",Medical imaging,"A doctor may also recommend an x-ray or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the affected joint. This can help to rule out other conditions that present with similar symptoms, such as septic arthritis, Lyme disease or inflammatory bowel disease.[10]",Treatment,"While there is no reactive arthritis cure, the condition generally resolves within a few months, up to about a year. In some patients, the condition does not fully resolve, and some chronic symptoms may remain.[11]",Treatments for reactive arthritis can be divided into three groups:,"
Antibiotics to treat infection
Treatment of joint inflammation and pain
Treatment of other symptoms
",Infection treatment,"If the triggering infection is found to be still present, a short course of antibiotic tablets is advised.","Good to know: Antibiotics do not usually lessen or shorten symptoms of joint inflammation once it has developed. Once reactive arthritis has been triggered, it will normally run its course long after the initial infection has cleared.[12]",Treatment of joint inflammation and pain,Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can be used to treat mild to moderate symptoms of joint inflammation and pain.,"Physiotherapy may be advised to keep the affected joints moving, to help retain flexibility and strength until symptoms subside.","If the joint inflammation becomes severe or ongoing, there are several treatment options available to improve symptoms and help prevent long-term joint damage:[12]","
Arthrocentesis (drawing fluid with a needle) from the affected joints
A steroid injection close to the inflamed tendon or into a muscle, so as to aid spreading throughout the body
A short course of low-dose steroid tablets
","If the above treatments don’t work well enough, disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDS) or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, also called TNF blockers, may be prescribed.",Treating other symptoms,"Conjunctivitis – inflammation of the whites of the eyes – can be treated with eye drops, though it usually goes away without any treatment. If iritis – inflammation of the coloured parts of the eyes – has been diagnosed, steroid eye drops may be prescribed.","Balanitis – inflammation of the end of the penis – usually goes away on its own, but if not, it can be treated with a mild steroid cream.",Acetaminophen can be taken to reduce a fever. Other symptoms are rare and may need specialist care if they develop.[12],FAQs,"Q: Reactive arthritis vs septic arthritis - what is the difference?
A: Septic arthritis, also known as infectious arthritis, and reactive arthritis are both arthritic conditions that result from the immune system’s response to infection. However, septic arthritis is caused by an active infection directly within an arthritic joint. Reactive arthritis is a reaction to an infection elsewhere in the body - commonly of the bowel or genital tract - and may affect several joints. Septic arthritis is generally more serious than reactive arthritis, as it is much more likely to cause permanent and irreversible damage.[13]",Read more about Septic Arthritis »,"Q: Reactive arthritis vs rheumatoid arthritis - what is the difference?
A: Reactive arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis are both arthritic conditions. Both tend to report pain and stiffness in the morning, sometimes with fever and fatigue.","However, reactive arthritis normally starts with inflammation in the larger joints, such as the hips or knees, whereas rheumatoid arthritis usually starts in the smaller joints, such as the hands and feet, or occasionally the knees. Rheumatoid arthritis is also more common in women between 30 and 60 years old, whereas reactive arthritis occurs more often in men under 40 years old.[14]",Read more about Rheumatoid Arthritis »,"Q: Is viral-associated arthritis the same as viral reactive arthritis?
A: No. Though reactive arthritis may be triggered by a virus, viral-associated arthritis is a separate condition. While reactive arthritis lasts several months, viral-associated arthritis lasts only a few days or weeks. Viral-associated arthritis is commonly caused by parvovirus, which is easily spread through children at school, but tends only to cause arthritic symptoms in adults.","Q: Are there home remedies for reactive arthritis?
A:** Home remedies and self care can help to alleviate symptoms.","One of the most common is the use of ice packs and heat pads to soothe and reduce the swelling. Splints can be used on the wrists and heel, and shoe pads can be used for the ankles, so as to lessen any strain. Gentle exercise combined with rest can help keep joints moving and maintain muscle strength and flexibility.","While it has not been conclusively proven, there is some evidence that fish body oils have reduced the need for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) in some people.[15] This is distinguished from fish liver oils, which would be toxic in the large quantities needed to have enough of an effect.","Q: What is the reactive arthritis triad?
A: A reactive arthritis triad of symptoms, involving eye pain and redness, painful urination and arthritis is frequently described as a classic indicator of the condition, after it was first described as such. However, it is now known that this is only found in a minority of cases.[9]"

When bursitis affects the shoulder, it can also be referred to as a rotator cuff injury.[16]","A bursa is a small sac filled with fluid that cushions bone and muscles, tendons or skin. Bursitis occurs when a bursa becomes inflamed. The affected area can become swollen and painful.[17][18]",Prolonged and repeated movement and pressure on the joint can cause bursitis. These movements can include:,"
Kneeling
Using picks and shovels
Raising arms
Leaning on elbows
",Tennis elbow,"Tennis elbow, also known as lateral epicondylitis, is a form of repetitive strain injury that affects the tendons attached to the outside of the elbow. Overuse or trauma can result in degeneration of the tendon’s attachment, which causes pain.",Activities that can lead to overuse include:[19][20],"
Playing racket sports, such as tennis
Repetitive gripping, such as cutting meat, painting or using a screwdriver
",Cubital tunnel syndrome,"Cubital tunnel syndrome is a form of repetitive strain injury where the ulnar nerve, which travels from the neck to the hand, becomes compressed or irritated at the elbow. Numbness and tingling in the hand and fingers can result, particularly in the ring and little fingers.[7][21]","Repeatedly stretching or bending the elbow, or keeping the elbow bent for long periods of time, can cause the ulnar nerve to become compressed.",Ulnar tunnel syndrome,"Ulnar tunnel syndrome, also known as Guyon’s canal syndrome, is a form of repetitive strain injury where the ulnar nerve becomes compressed at the wrist. The ulnar tunnel, or Guyon’s canal, is a canal in the wrist which the ulnar nerve passes through. If the ulnar nerve is compressed at the wrist, numbness and tingling in the  ring and little fingers can result.[22][23]","Ulnar tunnel syndrome is less common than cubital tunnel syndrome. It is most often caused by a benign cyst, but can also be caused by repetitive movement or pressure to the hand. Activities that can cause such pressure include:","
Gripping a bicycle handlebar

Typing
",Diagnosing repetitive strain injury,"There is no specific test to diagnose repetitive strain injury as the condition takes many forms. A complicating factor is that some conditions, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, can have several causes.","Repetitive strain injuries are diagnosed by taking a medical history and performing a physical examination. Symptoms may be the result of other conditions, and diagnostic tests may be ordered, such as:[2][7][11]","
Blood tests, to check for diabetes or inflammatory joint disease
X-rays, to check for arthritis or fractures
","Other tests can investigate damaged tissues, and include:[2][24][25]","
Nerve conduction studies (NCS). This test checks the function of nerves by applying small electrical currents and recording how well the nerve conducts electricity. The test causes a mild tingling and is not painful.
Electromyography, also known as Needle EMG. This test checks the function of muscles by inserting small needles to measure electrical signals. There may be a small amount of pain or discomfort during this test.
Scans. Medical imaging can reveal whether a condition is suitable for surgical treatment.

A: Repetitive strain injury can be cured with appropriate treatment, which may range from rest to surgery. Some severe cases may not be entirely cured. Effective treatment should be complemented by changing the activity that caused the injury. See Treatment for repetitive strain injury above."
,,,,,,,,,,What is restless legs syndrome
,,,,,,,,,,What is restless legs syndrome,"Restless legs syndrome (RLS), also known as Willis-Ekbom disease, is a chronic condition that causes strong, unpleasant feelings in the legs, resulting in an overwhelming need to move them. Moving the legs relieves the unpleasant sensations.[1][2][3]","Restless legs syndrome is considered a condition of the nervous system, sometimes referred to as a neurological disorder. Because RLS can seriously affect some people’s sleep patterns, it can also be classed as a sleep disorder.[4][5]","Around 8 percent of the population of the United States[6] and up to 10 percent of the population of the U.K.[7], is thought to be affected by restless legs syndrome. RLS symptoms often begin at around 40 to 45 years of age, more often affecting women than men.","Other conditions, such as pregnancy, iron deficiency anemia[1] or Parkinson’s disease[8] may cause restless legs syndrome.","Restless legs syndrome cannot be cured. However, there are various treatments, including home remedies, lifestyle changes and natural treatments, that can lessen the severity of symptoms. If RLS is triggered by a specific condition or medication, treating that condition can eliminate RLS.[2]",Symptoms of restless legs syndrome,The main symptom of restless legs syndrome is an overwhelming urge to move the legs because of uncomfortable and unpleasant feelings in one or both legs.,"The sensations in the legs and, in severe cases, the arms are variously described as:[1][9][10]","
Crawling
Itching
Aching
Throbbing
Pulling
Burning
Painful
Fizzing
Tickling
Tingling
Feeling the urge to move
Cramping
Restlessness
Creeping
Causing discomfort
Tense
Having an electric current
","Some people may experience the feelings as painful, but most people feel the sensations as an ache rather than something sharp and causing immediate pain.[2]","Symptoms occur when the person is at rest or inactive, such as:[6][9]","
Lying down
Sitting
In bed
In a restricted space, like on a plane or at the movies
","Symptoms improve in the mornings, and when the person starts to move or walk around.[1] Moving around as a remedy can be difficult when the person is trying to go to sleep.","Symptoms can vary in severity, from mild discomfort to being so disruptive and painful they affect day-to-day life. Sleep can be so disturbed that people have difficulty functioning during the day and can commonly lead to depression and anxiety.[1][7][10]",Periodic limb movement in sleep (PLMS),"Periodic limb movement in sleep (PLMS), also known as periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD)[3], is experienced by 80 percent of people with restless legs syndrome.[11]","Periodic limb movement in sleep causes limbs, commonly the legs but also sometimes the arms, to jerk or twitch involuntarily during sleep. It can be so severe as to wake the sleeper and disturb anyone sharing the bed. Limb movements may also occur during waking hours.[11]","Most people with restless legs syndrome have PLMS, but many people with PLMS do not also have restless legs syndrome.[12]",Causes of restless legs syndrome,"In most cases, it is not known what causes restless legs syndrome . This is called primary, or idiopathic, RLS.",Sometimes restless legs syndrome is caused by another health condition. This is known as secondary RLS.,Primary restless legs syndrome,"Primary restless legs syndrome tends to begin slowly, around the age of 40. This is earlier than most secondary RLS cases. RLS also runs in families, suggesting a genetic link.[7][13]","There is research that suggests restless legs syndrome is connected to problems with a part of the brain called the basal ganglia, which uses dopamine to control muscle movement. If this part of the brain becomes damaged, it can result in muscle spasms and jerky movements.[1]",Secondary restless legs syndrome,There are a number of other conditions that appear to be linked to causing restless legs syndrome. These may include:,Iron deficiency anemia,"A lack of iron in the body, leading to iron deficiency anemia[14], appears to be linked to restless legs syndrome.[15] Iron helps dopamine to function in the brain. Iron levels in the body also dip towards the end of the day, which corresponds with RLS symptoms becoming worse.",See the resource on iron deficiency for more information.,Restless legs syndrome and pregnancy,"Pregnant women may develop restless legs syndrome, with symptoms more common in the final trimester. Between 10 percent and 25 percent of pregnant women are thought to experience symptoms.[16]",Nobody is quite sure why pregnancy can trigger restless legs syndrome. There are suggestions it is connected to:[16],"
Low iron levels
Low folate levels
Circulation problems
Increase in estrogen
",Restless legs syndrome that develops during pregnancy generally goes away within a month after birth.[1],Other health conditions,"There are several conditions that can cause restless legs syndrome as a complication, such as:[2][13][10]","
End-stage kidney disease, particularly when needing dialysis
Nerve damage, including that caused by diabetes
Spinal cord disease
Multiple sclerosis
Fibromyalgia
Parkinson’s disease
Rheumatoid arthritis
",Triggers,"Many medications and other substances can make restless legs syndrome worse, such as:[2][13][17][18]","
Antidepressants, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants
Anti-nausea medication, particularly metoclopramide
Antipsychotic medications, such as haloperidol and phenothiazines
Lithium, used to treat bipolar disorder
Antihistamines, found in cold and allergy medications
Calcium channel blockers, used to treat high blood pressure
Beta blockers, used to treat blood pressure and heart conditions
Caffeine and alcohol
Smoking to excess
",Diagnosing restless legs syndrome,"These are the diagnostic criteria for RLS, published by the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG). All five criteria are required for the diagnosis:[10]","
An urge to move the legs, usually caused by uncomfortable and unpleasant sensations in the legs. Sometimes the urge to move is present without the sensations, and sometimes the arms or other body parts are involved as well as the legs
The urge to move or sensations in the limbs begin, or become worse while resting
The urge to move or sensations in the limbs are partially or totally eased by moving. Relief lasts as long as the movement continues
The urge to move or sensations in the limbs are worse in the evening or night, or only happen in the evening or night
Symptoms are not explained by another medical or behavioral condition
","A doctor will diagnose based on a description of symptoms and triggers. A physical and/or neurological exam may be done, a family history taken and possibly blood tests to look for underlying factors.[2]",A sleep study may be helpful to check for sleep disruption and periodic limb movement in sleep. (See Periodic limb movement in sleep (PLMS),"The Restless Legs Syndrome Foundation[6] produces an RLS Symptom Diary[19] which can be printed off and used to track symptoms, activities and sleep patterns. RLS-UK has a tool to help affected people monitor symptoms and medication.[20]",Restless leg syndrome in children,"There is thought to be a genetic link with restless legs syndrome. The Restless Legs Syndrome Foundation reports that 35 percent of people with the condition say they first experienced symptoms before the age of 20, and that 1.5 million children and adolescents in the United States are believed to be affected.[21]","Children with restless legs syndrome are likely to be tired during the day, due to disturbed sleep. This can affect their performance in school.","As restless legs syndrome is usually diagnosed by medical history, it can be difficult for children to express what they are experiencing and accurately report their symptom history. Children exhibiting twitching and fidgeting may be mistaken for having ADHD. There is research to suggest 25 percent of children with RLS or periodic limb movements in sleep may be misdiagnosed as having ADHD.[22]",Treatment of restless legs syndrome,"There is no cure for restless legs syndrome, though its symptoms can be managed to make the condition easier to live with.","If restless legs syndrome is caused by a condition or medication, symptoms may go and not return if the condition is cured or medication is stopped. For example:[2][23]","
RLS caused by pregnancy typically ends within four weeks after giving birth
RLS caused by iron deficiency can be treated by taking iron supplements
RLS caused or made worse by a medication may be treated by stopping or changing medication, after consultation with a medical professional
",Iron supplements,"Where restless legs syndrome is thought to be caused by a lack of iron and/or ferritin in the body, treatment with iron supplements is advised.","Discussion with a doctor will establish the appropriate amount of iron equivalent supplements per day, usually taken alongside supplements of vitamin C to help absorption. If this does not affect iron levels, an intravenous infusion may be necessary.[1][24]",The NHS notes that side effects of taking more than 20mg of iron a day can include:[25],"
Constipation
Stomach ache
Nausea and vomiting
","Taking extremely high doses of iron can be dangerous. Although iron supplements are commonly available, treating restless legs syndrome with iron should be supervised by a healthcare professional.",Lifestyle management,"If the symptoms of restless legs syndrome are mild, lifestyle changes may be the only treatment needed. In these cases, there are plenty of natural treatments and home remedies that can be tried.[1][2][26][27]",Adopting good sleep practices can help a person with restless legs syndrome get enough sleep. Not getting enough sleep can be one of the most disruptive consequences of RLS. Good sleep habits can include:,"
Going to bed and waking up at regular times
Not napping during the day
Making sure the bedroom is dark, cool, quiet and comfortable
Taking electronic equipment, such as TV and phone, out of the bedroom
",Changes to diet may also help with reducing symptoms of restless legs syndrome:,"Avoid stimulants, like caffeine, nicotine and alcohol, particularly before bed
Drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration","Certain activities can ease restless legs syndrome symptoms, such as:[26][27]","
Regular, moderate exercise
Avoid being confined in places; for example, choose an aisle seat at the movies or on a plane
Massaging the legs
Taking a warm bath
RLS-UK suggests hot-cold therapy: a shower of alternating hot and cold water
Simple leg stretches may help
",Medical devices,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved devices to treat restless legs syndrome[1], including a foot wrap[28] and a vibrating pad. This pad, called Relaxis, has been found to improve quality of sleep.[29]",Dopamine agonists,A class of drugs called dopamine agonists work by mimicking dopamine in the brain to stimulate a response. They are also often used to treat Parkinson’s disease.[30],Three types of dopamine agonists have been approved to treat restless legs syndrome:[1][31],"
Ropinirole
Pramipexole
Rotigotine, taken as a skin patch
",Side effects of these drugs can include:,"
Nausea
Sleepiness
Headaches
Dizziness
Fainting when standing up
","A less common side effect of these medications is a lack of impulse control. This can lead the person taking the drugs to develop obsessions with shopping, drinking, gambling or sex. Stopping the drugs will reverse this behavior.[32]",Levodopa,"Levodopa is a drug that the body converts into dopamine. It is usually taken alongside a drug called carbidopa, which stops levodopa being converted into dopamine before reaching the brain.[33][34]","Sudden drowsiness and falling asleep can be a side effect of taking levodopa. It is advisable not to drive, operate machinery or take part in potentially dangerous activities until it’s clear how levodopa affects the person taking it.[34]","Levodopa is not recommended for long term use as it can make restless legs syndrome symptoms worse. It’s generally prescribed for occasional use, when people feel symptoms coming on.",Anti-seizure medication,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration  has approved gabapentin enacarbil for treating restless legs syndrome. Two other anti-seizure medications, pregabalin and gabapentin, are being trialled.[24]","A long-release form of gabapentin enacarbil is used to treat restless legs syndrome. The medication decreases the uncomfortable, creeping feelings in the legs.[1][35]","Possible side effects, which lessen over time, of gabapentin enacarbil include:[35]","
Fatigue
Feeling dizzy
Feeling sleepy
","Gabapentin enacarbil appears to be as effective or better at treating symptoms of restless legs syndrome as the dopamine agonist pramipexole. It is of particular benefit to people with RLS, who are: [24][10]","
In pain
Experiencing disturbed sleep as the primary symptom
Having difficulty with impulse control
","To date, gabapentin enacarbil has not been shown to cause augmentation.[24]",Sleep aids,"One of the most disruptive effects of restless legs syndrome can be lack of sleep. Medication from the benzodiazapine class of drugs, also known as hypnotics, may be prescribed as a short-term solution to help induce sleep.[24]",Benzodiazapines can include:[1][24],"
Temazepam

Feeling sleepy during the day
Lack of concentration
Feeling sluggish
Causing or worsening sleep apnea
High risk of addiction
",Augmentation and rebound,There are complications associated with dopamine medication used for treating restless legs syndrome.,Augmentation is the name for symptoms worsening while taking medication for restless legs syndrome. People experiencing augmentation find that symptoms start earlier in the day and the symptoms become more severe.[37],"Augmentation is more common with levodopa use, seen in approximately 80 percent of cases as opposed to dopamine agonist use, seen in 2 percent to 35 percent of cases. It tends to occur around six months after starting a particular treatment.[38]","Ending the treatment will relieve signs of augmentation. However, coming off the drugs may be difficult as withdrawal symptoms can occur.[31]","Rebound occurs when restless legs syndrome symptoms appear in the morning or late at night and is related to a dose of the drug wearing off. It is differentiated from augmentation by lacking a worsening in severity of symptoms and of symptoms recurring at a different time of day; rebound occurs in the morning as opposed to evening, as seen in augmentation.[31][38]","As with augmentation, rebound can be halted and reversed by stopping taking the medication. Rebound can also be counteracted with longer-acting medication.",Treatment of restless legs syndrome in children,The US Food and Drug Administration has not approved any medication for treating restless legs syndrome in children. The long-term effects of treating children with medication approved for adults is unknown.[39],"Benzodiazapines, such as clonazepam, are not recommended for children because it can cause the collapse of the upper airway. Up to 20 percent of children taking levodopa and carbidopa can develop a side effect of feeling sick.[39]","Good sleep habits are recommended for treating restless legs syndrome in children, as is avoiding caffeine and antihistamines. Vitamin and mineral supplements may help, when taken in consultation with a doctor.[22][39]",Prognosis for restless legs syndrome,"Primary restless legs syndrome has no cure. Although symptoms may worsen with age, treatment and therapy can bring symptoms under control and minimize disruption to everyday life.[1]",Restless legs syndrome FAQs,"Q: Is restless legs syndrome painful?
A: Not generally. People tend to describe the sensations caused by restless legs syndrome as uncomfortable, such as crawling or itching. In severe cases, people may report feeling pain.","Q: What vitamin and/or mineral supplements are good for restless legs syndrome?
A: Sometimes restless legs syndrome is caused by an iron deficiency, in which case iron supplements can ease or reverse symptoms. If a person has a healthy and balanced diet, there is usually no need for supplements. A medical professional can assess whether symptoms of RLS are caused by a vitamin or mineral deficiency and can recommend supplements where necessary.","Q: Does magnesium help restless legs syndrome?
A: Although some people with restless legs syndrome report that products like magnesium oil spray has been helpful,[26] and others report magnesium supplements helped with insomnia,[40][41], Harvard Men’s Health Watch notes that studies on magnesium and sleep have, to date, been small and of short duration.[42] A scientific basis for using magnesium to help with restless legs syndrome is currently lacking.","Q: What essential oils help with restless legs syndrome?
A: Although some people report that symptoms are reduced by using essential oils, there is no scientific evidence that they have any effect. Any benefit is likely to be from massaging the legs or the placebo effect.","Q: What home remedies and natural treatments work for restless legs syndrome?
A: There are some lifestyle changes, such as good sleep hygiene, avoiding stimulants and taking exercise, that can ease symptoms of restless legs syndrome. (See Lifestyle management.) There are reports that drinking quinine tonic water, or placing a bar of soap under a bed sheet at night, will help; however, there is no scientific evidence for these activities, and any benefit is likely to be the placebo effect.","Q: What causes restless legs syndrome?
A: Nobody quite knows what causes primary restless legs syndrome. In some cases, restless legs syndrome can be triggered as a secondary condition in various cases, such as when someone is pregnant or has fibromyalgia or an iron deficiency. (See Causes of restless legs syndrome)","Q: What’s the best treatment for restless legs syndrome?
A: The best way to treat restless legs syndrome will depend on whether a cause can be found and how severe your symptoms are. For example, if your RLS is being caused by an iron deficiency, the treatment will be to take iron supplements. If you have primary RLS, but your symptoms are mild, you may be able to manage them without medication. If your symptoms are severe, there are various medications. Consult your doctor to find the right treatment for you. (See Treatment of restless legs syndrome)","Q: Will my restless legs syndrome develop into something more serious?

,,,,,,,,,,What is rheumatic fever?
,,,,,,,,,,What is rheumatic fever?,"Rheumatic fever is a inflammatory condition which occurs after an tonsillitis caused by a specific bacteria (specifically, a group A Streptococcus). Rheumatic fever commonly affects the joints and heart. Rheumatic fever can cause many different symptoms, but the most common symptoms are fever and pain and swelling of the joints. Other symptoms are chest pain, cough, shortness of breath, involuntary movements (chorea) and rash. Rheumatic fever is treated with antibiotics. Some children with rheumatic fever may go on to develop problems with their heart valves.",Risks,"Rheumatic fever has become rare in many countries because the underlying disease, a bacterial infection of the tonsils, can be treated with antibiotics. It still tends to be common in parts of the world where there is little access to medical care and crowded conditions. This condition tends to affect children between the ages of 5 and 15, and is rare in adults. Children who are not properly treated for bacterial tonsillitis are at higher risk of this condition.",Symptoms,"Symptoms develop within 10-20 days after a bacterial infection of the tonsil or throat. They include fever, headache, weakness, a non-itchy rash and joint pain which mostly affects larger joints and spreads from one joint to another. Later, involuntary muscle movements may occur. Some people may develop carditis (inflammation of the heart muscle), which causes chest pain, cough and shortness of breath.",Diagnosis,Diagnosis is based on the symptoms and physical examination. Blood tests that show signs of inflammation support the diagnosis. Examination of the heart with electrocardiography (ECG or EKG) and ultrasound scans might also be necessary.,Treatment,"The bacterial infection is treated with antibiotics. The symptoms of rheumatic fever can be reduced with anti-inflammatory medications and, if needed, steroid tablets. If the rheumatic fever involves the heart, long-term antibiotics might be prescribed.",Prevention,Seeing a doctor for tonsillitis and completing a whole course of antibiotics is important in preventing rheumatic fever. Having the tonsils removed after an episode of rheumatic fever may help to prevent future episodes of strep throat and recurrence of rheumatic fever.
,,,,,,,,,,What is rheumatoid arthritis?
,,,,,,,,,,What is rheumatoid arthritis?,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the joints, which develops gradually and is caused by an autoimmune reaction. This means that the immune system mistakenly forms proteins which are meant to fight infections, known as antibodies, that attack the body tissue instead.","The symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis occur in episodes or flare-ups of pain and swelling in the joints. Usually the joints are affected symmetrically, especially the hands, wrists and feet, and many joints may be inflamed. It can also affect other parts of a person’s body, including the lungs, heart and eyes. Onset may include symptoms such as fever and fatigue.","Women are affected more commonly than men. The onset of rheumatoid arthritis usually occurs over the age of 35, and the likelihood of developing the condition increases as a person gets older. Onset is highest among adults in their 60s. However, the condition can occur at any age.[1] Rheumatoid arthritis is normally a lifelong condition that worsens with age.","If RA is not treated early, it can cause irreversible damage to joints, leading to disability. However, it can normally be well managed with medications to slow down the immune system, as well as pain medications for relief of symptoms. There is currently no specific rheumatoid arthritis cure.","Rheumatoid arthritis generally appears in adults. However, a related condition may sometimes appear in children, when it is known as juvenile idiopathic arthritis, previously known as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. This condition may clear up by the time adulthood is reached. Many children with this condition also experience regular fevers.",Read more about Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis » for more information about rheumatoid arthritis in children.,Symptoms,"In most people, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) symptoms begin very subtly, and it may be many weeks or months before symptoms become troublesome enough to seek medical attention.",Early symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis may include:[2][3],"
Joint stiffness, often in the hands and feet, usually worse in the morning
Joint pain and swelling
Fatigue
Muscle pain
Low-grade fever
Numbness and tingling in the hands
","RA typically affects the small joints first, such as the first two joints of the fingers and the first joints of the toes. It can also start in one large joint, such as the knee or the shoulder, and may move from one joint to another or disappear for a long time before recurring.",Complications,"As the condition progresses, further signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis may develop, such as:[2][4]","Rheumatoid arthritis in hands: The swelling associated with rheumatoid arthritis causes some people to develop carpal tunnel syndrome. This is the compression of a nerve running through the wrist, characterized by tingling, numbness and weakness in the hand. Certain permanent bone alterations can also occur with long-term rheumatoid arthritis, such as swan neck deformities, boutonniere deformities and the bowstring sign.","Rheumatoid arthritis in knee: Inflammation of the knee is associated with difficulty bending the knee, damage to the bones that meet at the knee, and excessive looseness of the supporting ligaments of the knee. This may cause the development of a Baker’s cyst, a cyst which fills with joint fluid in the hollow space at the back of the knee.",Rheumatoid arthritis in feet: Pain in the feet may cause a person with rheumatoid arthritis to stand with weight on the heels and the toes bent upwards. The top of the foot may be red and swollen and the heel may be painful.,"Rheumatoid arthritis nodules: These are firm lumps which develop under the skin, usually near joints which are inflamed or near pressure points.  Common locations include the underside of the forearm, the elbow, and the fingers and knuckles of the hands.","Rheumatoid arthritis can cause inflammation of tissues other than the joints, for example:[2]",Rheumatoid arthritis in the lungs: may cause shortness of breath and a dry cough.,"Inflammation of the blood vessels, known as vasculitis: may cause a characteristic rheumatoid arthritis rash of spots which look like ulcers, and a wide variety of other symptoms, depending on the location of the affected blood vessels.","Inflammation of the tissue surrounding the heart, known as Pericarditis: may cause chest pain and shortness of breath.",Treatment,"It is very important to start treatment as soon as possible, to prevent any permanent joint damage. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can usually be effectively managed with early, appropriate treatment. There is currently no rheumatoid arthritis cure, and it is usually a chronic condition requiring lifelong treatment.",The main aims of treatment for RA are:[5][6],"
To prevent joint damage
To minimize pain and other symptoms, and maintain quality of life
To prevent the development of associated conditions such as osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease
",There are three main aspects of rheumatoid arthritis treatment:,"
Medication
Physical therapy
In some cases, surgery
",Medications,Rheumatoid arthritis is usually treated with a combination of medications. The five main types of rheumatoid arthritis drugs used are:[6],"Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): These offer pain relief and reduce minor inflammation, though they do not reduce the long-term damaging effects of RA.","Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs): These work by blocking the effects of chemicals released by the immune system, which can damage nearby bones, tendons, ligaments and cartilage.","Biologic agents: Also known as biologic response modifiers, these are a newer class of DMARDs. Biologic DMARDs are most effective when paired with a nonbiologic DMARD.","Steroids: These quickly improve symptoms such as joint pain, stiffness and swelling and are generally recommended where rheumatoid arthritis severely limits a person’s ability to function normally, until slower acting joint damage-preventing DMARDs begin to work.","Painkillers: These offer pain relief but have no effect on inflammation, and may be recommended in the case of a badly damaged joint that cannot be replaced with surgery.",Physical therapy,"People with rheumatoid arthritis often become inactive due to joint pain and stiffness. However, inactivity can lead to inflexibility, muscle and tendon shortening, and muscle weakness. In turn, weakness further increases fatigue and decreases stability of the joints.","A physiotherapist can recommend safe exercises to strengthen muscles, restore joint range-of-motion joints and ease symptoms.",An occupational therapist may recommend ways to approach day-to-day activities without putting too much strain on the joints. They may also recommend splints if needed for hand and wrist support.,"A podiatrist may work with a person on ways to ease problems with the feet and ankles, such as by using appropriate footwear.",Surgery,"Occasionally, surgery is needed to treat joints affected by rheumatoid arthritis. These can be minor surgeries, such as to release a nerve or tendon or more major surgeries such as hip, knee, shoulder and elbow replacements.",Diet,"There are no clear-cut answers as to what diet to follow with rheumatoid arthritis, as there is a lot of conflicting evidence, and different diets may affect people in different ways. However, it is generally recommended that a person eat:[7][8]","
A balanced and varied diet with plenty of fruit, vegetables, fish, pulses, nuts and olive oil to get all the vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and other nutrients you need
Omega-3 fatty acid-rich food regularly, such as oily fish, seaweed and walnuts
Calcium-rich food, such as dairy products and calcium-enriched non-dairy products
Vitamin-D-rich food, such as eggs
Iron-rich food, such as dark green vegetables
","Weight loss may be recommended for overweight people to reduce stress on affected joints. However, sometimes people with rheumatoid arthritis lose their appetite, and dietary therapy may be recommended to help ensure that an adequate amount of calories and nutrients are consumed.",Natural treatment,"Natural treatments have not conclusively been shown to stop or slow rheumatoid arthritis progression, but may help with pain relief when used in conjunction with prescribed rheumatoid arthritis medications.","Supplements for rheumatoid arthritis containing gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) have been shown to modestly improve joint pain, stiffness and grip strength.[9] This includes evening primrose oil or borage oil, especially when combined with fish oil, which reduces the synthesis of inflammatory by-products of GLA.[10]","Calcium and vitamin D supplements may be recommended if not enough is consumed through diet. These can help to minimize bone loss, which is associated with steroid therapy.[6]",Good to know: rheumatoid arthritis should never be treated exclusively with natural supplements or without seeing a doctor.,Causes,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease, which means that it is caused by abnormal functioning of the immune system. In a healthy immune system, the body attacks foreign bacteria and viruses. In the case of autoimmune disease, the body accidentally attacks healthy tissue instead. In rheumatoid arthritis, the body attacks its own joint tissue. Healthy joints are needed to absorb shock and allow for smooth movement between the bones.","People with RA produce an excess of white blood cells in the synovial membrane, the tissue that lines the cavities of joints; this causes inflammation. This can lead to joint erosion, loss of motion and occasionally damage to other associated parts of the body, such as the lungs, heart, blood vessels and eyes.","If RA is left untreated, pannus tissue may form, in which there is excess, uneven tissue growth in a joint, which can further erode and damage cartilage and bone.",Risk factors,"It is not certain what causes rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but some possible contributing factors have been identified, including:",Genetics,"Specific variants in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes are associated with a higher risk of developing RA. These variations make the white blood cells attempt to correct abnormalities in the joints more quickly than usual, which may be what leads to the inflammation and associated tissue damage that results from rheumatoid arthritis.","However, rheumatoid arthritis is not an inherited condition; not everyone with RA has a variant HLA system and not everyone with a variant HLA develops RA. Genes do not cause the condition, but affect the risk of it developing.[11] Other non-HLA genes have also been linked to RA.[12]",Bacteria and viruses,"People with rheumatoid arthritis seem to get infections more often than people without the condition. It is thought that this may affect the joints in several ways, including:[13]","Bacteria or viruses may leave the original infection site and move into the joint capsule. Some people with rheumatoid arthritis have been found to have the Herpes Simplex virus, which causes mouth or genital sores (see herpes simplex and the Epstein Barr virus, which causes mononucleosis, also known as mono or glandular fever, in their joint fluid.","Infection may trigger an attack by the immune system on the joints, as some joint cells may be registered by the immune system as similar to the cells of the infecting disease.","Infection may alter the joint cells, inducing rheumatoid arthritis. This has been found to be the case with some types of gum infections.","Joint tissue may be damaged by the immune system as it attacks a nearby infection in what is known as bystander effect. If the body does not sufficiently signal to turn off the immune response, it may then continue to target those originally affected tissues, even after the infection has cleared.","The immune system may become overactive after infection, continuing to attack cells that are similar to the originally infecting cell.",Smoking,"Research has shown that exposure to certain irritants in the air may play a role in a person’s risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis, including:[14][15]","
Tobacco smoke
Silica dust, mainly affecting people in the mining industry
Certain mineral oils, such as found in hydraulic oil
","Good to know: Once rheumatoid arthritis has developed, smoking can also increase the severity of rheumatoid arthritis symptoms and interfere with rheumatoid arthritis medication. Smoking may also cause a debilitating increase in heart rate and breathing rate, which may lead to a loss of will to exercise, in turn leading to further joint weakening. Tobacco smoking can also increase the risk of complications if surgery is needed for rheumatoid arthritis.",Gender,"Rheumatoid arthritis is far more common in women, who make up about 70 percent of people diagnosed. It is not known exactly why women are more likely to develop the condition, but hormonal factors are thought to play a part. The condition tends to decrease or disappear during pregnancy and people with the condition may experience flares in the weeks after giving birth.[16] It has been suggested that this may be due to production of prolactin, the milk production hormone, having an inflammatory effect.[15]",Physical trauma,"Physical trauma has been linked to rheumatoid arthritis onset, such as with sports injuries. Physical trauma can trigger inflammation, which it is thought may contribute to the development of rheumatoid arthritis, possibly at a much later date. However, it is not known why this might be. Some people may have a predisposition to such inflammation.[17]",Obesity,"Research has found that obesity may have an impact on the development of the condition.[18][19] It is not known why this is, but one reason postulated is that fat cells release proteins called cytokines, which create inflammation throughout the body.[20]","Good to know: Obesity may also have a negative impact on the effectiveness of rheumatoid arthritis treatment, particularly with some disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).[21] It can also lead to earlier deterioration of the main joints, such as the knees, due to increased pressure.",Prevention,"While there is no known way to prevent the onset of rheumatoid arthritis, there are a few known ways in which a person can reduce the risk. These include:","
Quitting tobacco smoking
Being physically active and eating a healthy diet
Taking steps to maintain a healthy weight
","It is also important to see a doctor as soon as symptoms develop, as early treatment can greatly minimize the rheumatoid arthritis progression, as well as any permanent damage caused by flare-ups.",Diagnosis,"Diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is generally confirmed after referral to a rheumatologist, a type of doctor specializing in inflammation and pain in the joints, muscles, or fibrous tissues.","RA can take a long time to diagnose as its early onset can be subtle and present similarly to other, less long-term conditions, such as flu, also known as influenza. It also often presents similarly to other types of arthritis, such as reactive arthritis.","Unlike other types of arthritis, there is no specific test for rheumatoid arthritis . Instead, a rheumatologist relies on gathering information to rule out other conditions and identify the cause of a person’s symptoms. Diagnosis may be made from a combination of reported medical history and symptoms, a physical examination, laboratory tests and medical imaging.",Interview and physical exam,"It is important that a person describe any joint pain and other symptoms, as well as how long they have been going on for.","A doctor will look for signs of rheumatoid arthritis, such as swollen, tender, warm joints with painful or limited movement, and rheumatoid nodules. They may also ask for family medical history; if another member of their family has the disease, then a person has a higher risk of having the condition themselves.",Laboratory tests,"If a doctor suspects rheumatoid arthritis, one or more tests may be done to help make a diagnosis. These include:[22]","Testing for rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies: RF is a protein that attacks healthy tissues. If it is present, there is about an 80 percent chance that a person has or may develop rheumatoid arthritis or another inflammatory disease. Anti-CCP antibodies indicate that a person is very likely to develop RA.",Measuring inflammatory markers: Abnormally high levels of certain markers in the blood would support a diagnosis that symptoms are caused by an inflammatory condition such as rheumatoid arthritis. Inflammatory markers which may be detected by a blood test include:,"
Tumor necrosis factor-alpha
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR or sed rate)
C-reactive protein (CRP)
","Good to know: The presence of anti-CCP antibodies in the blood indicates that a person with RA may be more likely to develop severe symptoms, requiring more intensive treatment.",Medical imaging,"A doctor may also recommend an X-ray, ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the affected joint. This can help to rule out other conditions that present with similar symptoms, such as gout. However, at an early stage of rheumatoid arthritis, any characteristic damage caused by the condition may not be apparent.[22]",FAQs,"Q: Osteoarthritis vs. rheumatoid arthritis - what is the difference?
A: Both rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA) are types of chronic, untreatable arthritis which may be confused due to having the similar symptom of joint pain and inflammation. However, they have different causes. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease with a typically sudden onset of symptoms and occurs in episodes of inflammation on symmetrical joints of the body. OA is a “wear and tear” condition associated with factors such as older age, injury or obesity. It develops slowly, caused by continuous use of particular joints. RA tends to involve additional symptoms such as fever and fatigue, whereas OA only affects the joints. Rheumatoid arthritis onset tends to occur from 30 to 60 years old, while OA tends to develop later in life.[23]","Q: Is rheumatoid arthritis hereditary?
A: One’s genetics can increase the chances of developing the condition, and a number of genetic markers have been identified that increase this risk. However, not everyone with RA has these, nor does everyone who has such genetic markers develop RA. Many genetic and environmental factors appear to be involved in whether a person develops rheumatoid arthritis.[24]",Other names for rheumatoid arthritis,"
RA

,,,,,,,,,,What is rickets?
,,,,,,,,,,What is rickets?,"Rickets is a condition which affects the development of bones in children. Caused in most cases by a deficiency of vitamin D and subsequently also calcium, the condition can lead to the bones becoming soft and weak. This process can ultimately lead to bone deformity if left untreated.","Rickets is most common in children, but its equivalent can also occur in adults. In such cases, the condition is known as osteomalacia or “soft bones”.","Treating rickets generally involves following a nutritionally-balanced diet and/or taking vitamin supplements. In most cases, the condition can be treated successfully.[1]",Symptoms of rickets,Symptoms of rickets may include:[2][3],"
Growth and development issues: Children may be shorter than average due to bone development problems.
Pain: Bones may become sore or painful, especially when pressure is applied. This may lead to a child being reluctant to walk or get up from a sitting position, and they may appear to walk abnormally.
Brittle bones: Bones may become weaker than normal, leading to an increased likelihood of fracturing and breaking.
Dental issues: May include weak tooth enamel, slow development of teeth and an increased likelihood of cavities.
Deformities: The ankles, wrists and knees may become thicker than normal. Bowed legs, a softening of the skull and – less commonly – a bending of the spine may also occur.
","If any of these symptoms are present, medical attention should be sought.","Many of the same symptoms may also occur in adults experiencing osteomalacia. However, adults tend to report more bone pain and tenderness than children with rickets.",Causes of rickets,"Rickets can be caused by a variety of factors, including:","
Vitamin D and/or calcium deficiency
Genetics
Underlying conditions
",Vitamin D and calcium deficiency,"A deficiency of vitamin D and/or calcium is by far the most common cause of rickets in children. The majority of children will receive sufficient amounts of calcium through their diet. However, it is rare for one’s diet to contain sufficient quantities of vitamin D, and many people choose to use a vitamin D supplement in order to ensure that they get the required amount.",Foodstuffs containing vitamin D and calcium include:[4],"
Vitamin D: Small quantities of vitamin D are found in oily fish, e.g. salmon, eggs, some dairy products like cheese and some cereals.
Calcium: Found in dairy products such as cheese, milk and yoghurt, as well as green vegetables such as kale and broccoli.
","Vitamin D and calcium supplements are widely available. Consulting a physician when choosing a vitamin supplement is recommended, in order to ensure that it is appropriate for the individual.",Factors that make children more likely to develop rickets related to vitamin D or calcium deficiency include:[5],"
Dark skin: Dark skin contains more melanin than light skin, increasing the amount of UV-B light/sun exposure needed to produce vitamin D.
Lack of exposure to sun: Children who spend the majority of their time indoors, or lack exposure to sunlight for any other reason, are less likely to produce a sufficient amount of vitamin D. Additionally, if children live in countries that are far away from the equator and/or in the northern hemisphere, even if they spend plenty of time outdoors, the sunlight may not be strong enough to effectively stimulate vitamin D production.
Pre-existing conditions: Certain conditions – such as liver disease, kidney disease and celiac disease – can affect the way the body produces and controls vitamin D.
Breastfeeding: Children who are exclusively breastfed and have dark skin and/or a mother who is lacking in vitamin D have a higher chance of developing rickets.
",Genetics,"In rare cases, rickets can run in families.","The most common form is hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets, which results from mutations in several genes. This condition renders the kidneys unable to retain phosphate, leading to a deficiency of this important chemical. Phosphate plays a central role in bone formation and growth.[6][7]",Underlying conditions,"In rare cases, rickets can develop as a result of underlying conditions (some of which are hereditary) of the liver, kidneys or intestines. These conditions typically affect the way the body produces, absorbs and retains minerals and vitamins, and may lead to deficiencies. These include phosphate and calcium deficiencies, which can result in rickets if left untreated.[7]",Diagnosing rickets,"Diagnosing rickets will generally involve a doctor taking the person’s full medical history, followed by blood tests to check the vitamin D, phosphate, calcium and parathyroid hormone levels. In some cases, blood tests may also be used to check liver and kidney function.","Sometimes, X-rays may also be used to check for skeletal changes or deformity. A dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) may also be used to check bone calcium levels.[7]",Rickets treatment,The necessary treatment route for rickets depends on the condition’s underlying cause.,"When rickets is caused by a deficiency of vitamin D or calcium, increasing the intake of each is the primary treatment option. Methods of doing this include:[8]","
Consuming more food rich in vitamin D and calcium, such as oily fish, cereals and eggs for vitamin D, and green leafy vegetables and dairy products for calcium.
Taking supplements containing vitamin D and calcium.
Receiving a vitamin D injection (usually administered yearly and, in most cases, only if other options are unavailable).
Increasing one’s exposure to sunlight.
",Treatment for genetic forms of rickets will depend on the type. Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets (the most common genetic form) typically requires phosphate and vitamin D supplements.,Supplement side-effects,"It is rare for vitamin D or calcium supplements to cause any side-effects. However, if an incorrect dose of calcium is given, this can result in a condition known as hypercalcemia. Signs and symptoms include:[9]","
Loss of appetite
Nausea and/or vomiting
Constipation
Abdominal pain
Thirstiness and an increased need to urinate
Fatigue and/or weakness
Muscle pain
Confusion
Headaches
","If any of these signs or symptoms appear after starting a new supplement, medical attention should be sought without delay.",Rickets prevention,"To ensure one receives the required amount of vitamin D, several measures can be taken:[^10]","
Eating a nutritionally-balanced diet
Spending time in the sun
Taking vitamin supplements (after talking to a doctor about the most suitable type and dose)
",Diet,Maintaining a diet rich in vitamin D and calcium is an effective way of helping to prevent the onset of rickets. Foodstuffs containing these include:,"
Vitamin D: Oily fish, eggs, red meat, beef liver and some cereals.
Calcium: Dairy products including cheese, milk and yoghurt, as well as green vegetables such as kale and broccoli.
",Sunlight,"Exposure to natural sunlight is a good source of vitamin D. Depending on where a person lives, the time of year, the color of their skin and the clothes they wear, the amount of time needed in the sun will differ. For a person to produce vitamin D, sunlight has to reach the areas of skin that are not covered by clothes.","In a very sunny location in summer, a person may not need much outdoor time daily to produce a healthy amount of vitamin D. The body can produce between 10 000 and 25 000 IU of vitamin D in little less than the time it takes for the skin to start burning. Vitamin D production is maximized when a large area of the skin, such as the back, is exposed.[10]","In many countries in the northern hemisphere, including Germany, the UK, Canada and northern parts of the US, the sun is too weak to produce sufficient amounts of vitamin D between roughly September and March. This means that, even if people spend a lot of time outdoors, it will be necessary to rely on other sources of this vitamin during the winter months.[11]","Although exposure to sunlight is important, it’s also crucial to remember the potential damage sunlight can cause to the skin, especially when sunburn occurs. If spending an extended amount of time exposed to the sun, sunscreen should always be worn.",Supplements,It is generally advised that the following groups of people take vitamin D supplements:,"
Breastfed babies from birth to one year of age.
Children ages 1-4 years old.
","In the autumn, winter and early spring, children and adults may benefit from taking vitamin D supplements, especially those living in regions far from the equator.","Vitamin D supplements are typically available over-the-counter from pharmacies, but may also be prescribed by a doctor, who will be able to recommend the safest, most suitable supplement for a specific person.",Rickets FAQs,"Q: Can rickets occur in adults?
A: Yes, an equivalent of rickets can occur in adults, in a rare condition known as osteomalacia or soft bones. The two conditions share the same causes, symptoms and treatment options.","Q: How common is rickets?
A: Today, rickets is a rare condition in developed countries, in large part due to many common foodstuffs (such as cereals and bread) being fortified with vitamin D. However, children with darker skin, those who are not outside much and/or those without access to adequate nutrition are at risk of developing rickets, even in developed countries."
,,,,,,,,,,What is rosacea?
,,,,,,,,,,What is rosacea?,"Rosacea is a skin condition that affects the face. It is not contagious, but it is very common: in the United Kingdom, for example, about one in 10 adults are affected,[1] and, according to recent statistics, over 16 million Americans.[2]","Rosacea is not a type of acne, and the term “acne rosacea” is misleading. However, acne and rosacea may occur together. Unlike acne, rosacea is more common among older people, particularly those aged between 40 and 60 years of age.[3] It is somewhat more common among women than men, but tends to be more severe in men.[4] Also, unlike acne, rosacea does not cause scarring.[3]","Rosacea usually affects the skin of the face, particularly the nose, cheeks and forehead.[1] In some cases, it can affect the skin of the neck, chest and ears, and rarely, it can affect the eye. Rosacea is not always itchy or painful, but may cause a stinging or burning sensation. It can also be unsightly and distressing to those affected by it.[1]","Its most prominent symptoms are facial redness and flushing. A rare effect of rosacea is rhinophyma, a thickening of the skin on and around the nose that leads to a characteristic red and bumpy appearance.[1] This is usually found in older male sufferers.",Types of rosacea,There are several subtypes of rosacea:[5][6],"
Erythromatotelangiectactic, characterized by skin redness and visible small blood vessels.
Papulopustular, characterized by papules (small pimples) and pustules (small pimples containing pus).
Phymatous (both mild and severe subtypes), marked by thickened skin.
Ocular, affecting the eyes.
","Treatment depends on which sort of rosacea is present. People suspected of having rosacea, particularly those who suffer from ocular rosacea or from symptoms that are resistant to treatment, should generally be treated by a specialist such as a dermatologist or ophthalmologist.",Symptoms of rosacea,"Because rosacea is common, most competent medical practitioners will be able to diagnose it based on the patient’s history and the appearance of their skin. In some cases, doctors may recommend that blood tests are done, in order to rule out other conditions that cause skin redness, such as systemic lupus erythematosus.[1]",The symptoms of rosacea are distinctive. They include:[1][3][4],"
A tendency to blush or flush easily, leading to transient redness, also known as erythema
Dilated and visible blood vessels under the surface of the skin, known as telangiectasia
Red bumps, known as papules, and pustules, slightly resembling mild acne
Thickened skin, known as phymatous changes
Eye problems, such as sore eyelids and dry eyes
","The symptoms of rosacea tend to begin mildly, but worsen with time. People affected will first notice an increased tendency to blush or flush, with skin redness taking longer and longer to fade. Over time, the redness will become permanent. The intensity of facial flushing can be affected by emotion, hydration, chemicals and stress.[7]","In some cases of rosacea, small blood vessels under the skin become more prominent. Itching is sometimes present, and redness is often accompanied by a burning sensation. Affected people may find that their skin is hot to the touch during a flushing episode.",Symptoms of ocular rosacea,Ocular rosacea is a complication of the condition. Symptoms include:[3][5][8],"
Itchy, burning or stinging eyes.
Dry, scratchy eyes.
A feeling of grit or a foreign body in the eye.
Photosensitivity (sensitivity to light).
Inflammation of the eyelid (blepharitis), styes, or cysts.
Chalazions, which are small, usually painless lumps on the eyelid, caused by blocked oil or meibomian glands. These are not to be confused with styes, which result from infection. Styes are painful and tend to occur near the eyelashes.
","Inflammation of the cornea , the transparent front covering of the eye, is rare but serious, and can affect vision. If corneal inflammation, also known as rosacea keratitis, occurs, seek medical help as soon as possible.[3]",Causes of rosacea,"The exact cause of rosacea has not yet been established. It is possible that it is an autoimmune response, a reaction to high skin pH, a response to undiagnosed food sensitivity or the result of a high number of demodex folliculorum mites on the face.[1][7] There may also be a genetic component.","According to present knowledge, there is no way to prevent rosacea from beginning, and there is currently no way to entirely eliminate the condition.[1]",There is some evidence that rosacea’s facial flushing is caused by the body’s sympathetic nervous system becoming stimulated.[7] The sympathetic nervous system is the part of the nervous system that is involved in activating the fight or flight response. It is activated by strong emotion or physical stress.,"Research has shown that rosacea can be triggered by various physical and environmental factors, such as weather conditions, exercise, cosmetics or certain foods. Many people with rosacea find it helpful to keep a diary of their outbreaks in order to narrow down what their particular triggers are.",Some common triggers are:[1][7][9],"
Emotional stress
Strenuous exercise
Exposure to strong sunlight
Hot weather
Cold weather
Wind
High humidity
Hot baths/showers
Exfoliant, abrasive or astringent facial products
Makeup containing oils
Perfumed sunblocks
Sunblock or skin preparations containing insect repellents
Consumption of alcohol
Very sugary foods
Spicy foods, such as those containing chili
Smoking
Calcium-channel blockers, also known as calcium antagonists, such as dihydropyridine
",Not all rosacea sufferers are vulnerable to all of these triggers.,"Many of these triggers, such as exercise, alcohol and calcium antagonists, cause the dilation of the blood vessels (vasodilation), which increases blood flow. Increased blood flow to the skin causes a distinctive appearance of redness. Some of these triggers, for example exposure to sunlight, wind, smoking and cold weather, cause inflammation of the skin, which also causes redness.",Treatment and management of rosacea,"Although there is currently no total cure for rosacea, there are many treatment options. Treatment may need to be long-term, but it is easily manageable and very effective.","Treatment for rosacea is mainly concerned with reducing inflammation and managing sensitive skin.[3] Treatment options include topical creams and ointments, oral medications, and lifestyle changes. People with this condition may find that some treatments, or combinations of treatments, work better for them than others do.",Topical medication: creams and ointments,"Topical preparations, which are applied to the skin rather than taken orally, can help rosacea sufferers lessen the redness and inflammation they experience. Commonly-prescribed topical rosacea treatments include:[1][3][4][5]","
Brimonidine cream
Azelaic acid cream
Sodium sulfacetamide-sulfur cream
Doxycycline ointment
Metronidazole cream
","Some rosacea sufferers find that applying jojoba oil is helpful.[10] However, people with rosacea should never use acne preparations and should avoid topical corticosteroids, unless they are specifically prescribed by a specialist. While topical steroid preparations are helpful in reducing inflammation in the short term, in the long term they can make the problem worse.[3]","In cases where the rosacea is mild, it may be possible to manage it with only topical creams and lifestyle changes.",Laser and light treatment,"In cases of severe rosacea, laser and light treatments are an option for the treatment of redness, inflammation, pustules and rhinophyma. Nonablative lasers that do not destroy tissue, in the 500 to 600 nanometer (nm) range, and long-pulsed pulse dye lasers, as well as 532nm potassium-titanyl-phosphate lasers can help alleviate rosacea symptoms. Intense pulsed-light devices in the 515 to 1200nm range are another option.[11]","Phymatous rosacea, which causes thickening of the skin and may cause rhinophyma, can be treated with ablative lasers that destroy tissue, such as erbium or CO2 lasers. The object of this treatment is to remove the overgrowth of tissue from the area.[11]",Oral medication,"In severe cases, some people with rosacea find that a course of oral antibiotics helps reduce inflammation. This is true even though it is not known whether there are any particular bacteria involved in causing rosacea. Oral antibiotics that are sometimes used to treat rosacea include the tetracycline class:[3]","
Tetracycline
Oxytetracycline
Doxycycline
Lymecycline
Minocycline
","A course of 40mg of oral doxycycline daily is often effective. If doxycycline is not an option, 100mg of oral minocycline daily has been found to be effective as well.[12]",Other oral medications include:[3][5][6],"
Erythromycin
Trimethoprim
Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
Ampicillin
Clindamycin
Dapsone
","Blushing and redness may also be managed by beta-blockers or clonidine.[3] Very severe rosacea, especially phymatous rosacea that may lead to rhinophyma, or thickening of the skin, may respond well to isotretinoin.[6] The length of time for which an individual may have to take antibiotics depends on how severe their rosacea is and how well they respond to antibiotic treatment. However, it is important that all courses of antibiotics prescribed for rosacea are completed in order to assess whether they were effective.","In most cases, improvement can be expected within two to three weeks of beginning a course of antibiotics, but it may take several months to completely clear up symptoms such as papules and pustules.[1] Moreover, pustules and papules may return when the antibiotic course is over. If this happens, a longer-term course of maintenance doses of antibiotics might be effective.","Antibiotics can have serious side effects, so the use of oral antibiotic treatments should only be considered when topical treatments and lifestyle changes have proved to be ineffective in reducing severe rosacea.",Management of ocular rosacea,"Ocular rosacea affects the eyes rather than the skin, and so the treatment program is quite different in some ways. It may cause inflammation of the eyelid (blepharitis), which is painful and may increase the risk of infection.[8] Styes, cysts and chalazions may also occur.[13]",The first line of treatment for ocular rosacea is to improve eyelid hygiene. This is done by using:,"
Artificial tears to moisten and lubricate the eye, and reduce irritation. Care should be taken to use only eye drops that mimic natural tears. Never touch the surface of the eyeball or eyelid with the nozzle of the bottle.[5][8]
A warm compress, using a clean cloth soaked with very warm water held against each eye for five to 10 minutes. The cloth should be remoistened with warm water regularly. This reduces inflammation, cleans the eyelid and provides relief from stinging.[8]
To remove irritants such as dust, grit and secretions from the eyelid and eyelashes, wipes with a physiological salt solution, i.e.one that mimics the eye’s natural moisture, can be used. Pharmacists can help if necessary.[8]
","Thereafter, antibiotics in several forms may be used:","
Topical antibiotic creams, gels or drops containing ciclosporin or metronidazole
Oral antibiotics such as azithromycin or a tetracyline[5]
","A course of oral oxytetracycline followed by an eight-week course of topical metronidazole has been found to alleviate symptoms.[13]. Otherwise, oral tetracyline taken once daily, along with topical ivermectin and/or azelaic acid, may be helpful.","People with ocular rosacea or irritated eyes as a result of rosacea should avoid eye makeup, rubbing their eyes and taking Omega 3 supplements. Wearing contact lenses may be uncomfortable with inflamed eyes.[8]",Home management,"Aside from using prescription antibiotics, people with rosacea can take easy steps at home to get relief from the discomfort of rosacea and the appearance of symptoms. For many people, this involves, learning to avoid triggers and removing irritants from their care regimes.",Cleansing and skincare[1][3][5],"Generally, people with rosacea will find it helpful to avoid getting sunburned. If exposure to strong sunlight cannot be avoided, a strong sunblock should be used with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 or more, as well as UVB and UVA protection.","People with rosacea who regularly shave their faces, should switch from a traditional bladed razor to an electric razor. Electric razors do not come into such tight contact with the skin and are therefore less irritating.","Cleansers used by people with rosacea should not contain abrasives, including organic abrasives such as crushed apricot kernels, alcohol or acetone. Perfumed soaps, moisturisers and washes should be avoided. Oil-based or waterproof makeup should be avoided. Insect-repellent facial moisturisers or sunblock should not be used.","Hypoallergenic, non-greasy, non-perfumed emollient preparations can be used. Over-the-counter acne preparations are not helpful to people with rosacea. They may make the symptoms worse and should be avoided.",Lifestyle changes,"People with rosacea, who smoke tobacco cigarettes or regularly consume alcohol, may find it useful to cut back their consumption. Smoking dries the skin, while alcohol widens blood vessels and therefore worsens the redness of skin.","As stress is known to make rosacea symptoms worse, learning to manage stressful situations and general life stress is recommended by many rosacea groups, such as the International Rosacea Foundation and the National Rosacea Society.[7][10]","Weight management can assist in the alleviation of redness, while maintaining good hydration by drinking enough water is believed to help lessen the redness and inflammation characteristic of rosacea. A diet low in processed carbohydrates may also be helpful in some cases, as carbohydrates cause blood glucose to increase, which can lead to vasodilation and thus redness.[10]","In people who have severe rosacea, or feel that the appearance of their symptoms is negatively impacting their quality of life, learning to apply camouflage makeup may be helpful. Many regional health communities can arrange access to camouflage makeup tutorials and workshops.",FAQs,"Q: How do I know whether my skin condition is acne or rosacea? 
A: Both rosacea and acne are common inflammatory disorders of the skin.[14]  Many people with papulopustular rosacea have pimples and spots that resemble the symptoms of acne. Moreover, people with rosacea may also have acne. However, one way to distinguish between acne and rosacea is to compare which areas of the body are affected.","Acne can affect the face, neck, chest, back and shoulders, while rosacea mostly affects only the face. In acne, blackheads are often prominent, but they are seldom found in rosacea. Acne tends not to be accompanied by the reddening of skin that is rosacea’s most obvious characteristic. Acne very seldom causes inflammation of the eyelids or eye discomfort.[15]","Age of onset for rosacea tends to be later in life than for acne; acne is more common among teenagers and young adults, while rosacea is more common among people approaching middle age.[16]","If you are concerned about whether the condition affecting you is acne or rosacea, it is best to consult your primary care physician or a dermatologist.","Q: Will over-the-counter preparations help my rosacea? 
A: No, they will not. In fact, some over-the-counter preparations, particularly those for the treatment of acne, may make rosacea worse. The best course of treatment for rosacea involves a very gentle skincare regime and learning to avoid triggers. In severe cases, prescription antibiotics may be used."
,,,,,,,,,,What is roseola infantum?
,,,,,,,,,,What is roseola infantum?,"Roseola infantum – also called roseola, three-day rash or three-day fever, exanthem subitum, pseudo-rubella or sixth disease – is a typically mild, self-limiting viral infection that mainly affects infants and toddlers. It causes a high fever, which is often followed by a rash on the trunk (torso) that may spread to the face, arms and legs.[1][2]","The rash is typically characterized by small, painless pink or red spots that turn white when pressed firmly. The spots may be flat or raised and may be surrounded by a white ring. The rash can fade quickly, within a few hours of appearing, or remain for a couple of days.[1][3]","Roseola is most common in children between six months and two years of age. Most children have been exposed to roseola before they are five years old and develop the antibodies to avoid repeat infection. However, roseola is occasionally contracted by older children, or adults who have not previously encountered it. If adults contract roseola, the symptoms are usually very mild.[4][5] It is possible to have roseola more than once, but this is unusual, unless the person has a compromised immune system.[2][6]","Roseola is caused by two viruses in the herpes family: HHV, or human herpes virus, most often type 6 or occasionally type 7.[2] The virus is spread via droplet infection, when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through direct contact with an infected person or item that was, for example, sneezed on by an infected person.[5] This kind of herpes infection does not lead to herpes labialis or genital sores.[7]","Most children make a full and fast recovery from roseola without any specific treatment other than rest and adequate hydration.[8][2][9] Over-the-counter medicine, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen (Paracetamol or Tylenol), may be recommended to help with symptoms like the fever.[1]",Roseola infantum symptoms,"Following exposure to and infection with one of the two viruses that causes roseola infantum, symptoms typically appear after an incubation period of approximately 9 to 10 days, though this can  generally be between 5 and 15 days.[1][2][10] The incubation period is the time between catching an infection and symptoms appearing.","The first symptom is rapidly occurring high fever above 100.4 F or 38 C. The fever can last from three to seven days, and a rash typically develops after the fever passes.[4][5]",Common initial signs of roseola infantum may include:[1][5][8][11][2],"
Sudden development of high fever up to 104 F or 40 C
Irritability
Tiredness
Pink or red spots (called Nagayama spots) at the back of the throat and on the uvula[3][2]
Runny nose
Loss of appetite
Swollen glands in the neck
",Less common signs may include:[2],"
Irritated eyes and swollen eyelids
Inflamed tympanic (ear drum) membranes
Vomiting
Diarrhea
Sore throat
Cough
","Some people experience practically no symptoms of roseola.[4] However, they may still be contagious, i.e. able to transmit the virus to others. Practising good hygiene can help prevent the spread of roseola and many other diseases.[12]","If you or your child are experiencing possible symptoms of roseola infantum, try using the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.",Roseola infantum rash,"When the fever passes, a distinct rash will often appear on the chest, back and stomach, sometimes spreading to the arms and legs and occasionally the face too. The rash is usually characterized by small pink or red spots that turn white when pressed. Some of the spots may have a white ring around them.[1][3]","The rash may have a raised appearance or remain flat, and it does not itch or hurt. It can fade within a few hours or persist for a couple of days.[1][3][8][2]","The infection is usually over by the time the rash develops, and most children feel well again. As the fever and early symptoms can mimic other conditions, roseola is sometimes hard to diagnose. The fever appears before the characteristic rash, and high fevers can have quite a few other causes in infants and toddlers. This is why doctors usually diagnose roseola based on the appearance of the rash.[4]",Causes of roseola infantum,"Roseola is most commonly caused by human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6), though it can also be caused by human herpes virus 7 (HHV-7). These types of herpes are different to the strains that cause cold sores and genital herpes.[5][9]","The virus is spread through droplets of fluid from the mouth, throat and nose, for example when a person coughs or sneezes. Contact with a person who has roseola, or items that have been contaminated with infected droplets, can result in the virus being transmitted.[5][9]",Diagnosis of roseola infantum,"A doctor will typically diagnose roseola after taking the child’s or adult’s medical history and performing a physical examination. They will consider the signs and symptoms and rule out other common illnesses that cause a rash, such as measles or rubella (German measles). Laboratory blood tests may be ordered to confirm the diagnosis of roseola, but these are only rarely used, e.g. for very unclear presentations or people with a compromised immune system.[5][2][9]",Prevention of roseola infantum,"While it may not always be possible to prevent roseola, steps can be taken to reduce the risk of developing the condition. These include:[8][11]","
Washing the hands thoroughly and often, with warm, not too hot, water and soap
Teaching children to sneeze and cough into tissues and to dispose of them in a sanitary manner
Avoiding the sharing of cups, plates and cutlery
Regularly disinfecting surfaces around the home
",There is no vaccination to prevent roseola.,Roseola infantum treatment and medication,"Roseola and the rash typically go away on their own, without any special treatment. A child or adult with roseola can usually recover at home.",The fever can be managed using techniques including:,"
Drinking lots of fluids
Getting plenty of rest
Dressing in cool clothing
Applying a cool cloth to the head
","As roseola is a viral infection, antibiotics are not prescribed. Over-the-counter drugs such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen can be given in appropriate doses to reduce fever and pain.","Aspirin should never be given to treat a fever in children or young adults under 19 years of age, as it increases their risk of developing Reye’s syndrome, a life-threatening condition.[13]","The roseola virus remains in the body for life, making reactivation or reinfection possible at a later stage. This is more likely to occur if the person becomes immunocompromised, for example while undergoing treatment for cancer or receiving a bone marrow transplant.[2][14] If a child has a severely weakened immune system, the doctor may prescribe the antiviral drug ganciclovir to help treat the roseola and avoid complications.[4]",Complications of roseola infantum,"Roseola typically does not cause any complications. However, in some children, up to 15 percent of cases, the high fever can cause febrile seizures (fever seizures).[1][2][5]","In very rare cases, roseola can lead to other complications like encephalitis, i.e. an inflammation of brain structures. The risk of this occurring is higher in children and adults with weakened immune systems.[5]","If you or you child are experiencing symptoms you are worried about, try using the free Ada app to find out what the problem may be.",Febrile seizures,"Febrile seizures are convulsions and periods of unresponsiveness that typically last for a few minutes. They can be alarming, but are seldom harmful.[1][15][16]","If a child has no history of febrile seizures but seems to be experiencing one, an ambulance should be called without delay to be on the safe side or the child taken to a hospital or urgent care treatment center to receive a proper workup of the condition.[17][16]","In children with a history of febrile seizures, it is recommended that caregivers note the start time of a seizure and, should it continue for more than five minutes, call an ambulance immediately. Similarly, if the seizure ends within five minutes, but the child does not recover quickly and return to normal, an ambulance should be called.[16]","During a febrile seizure, the child should not be restrained, but placed on the ground or another appropriate, safe surface, and positioned on their side or stomach. If there is anything in the child’s mouth, this should be gently removed, if it is possible to do so without causing harm to the child or caregiver. Nothing should ever be placed in a child's or any person’s mouth during a convulsion.[16]",Read more about Febrile Seizures »,When to see a doctor,"Most children recover from roseola within a week of the onset of the fever.[9] However, a doctor should be contacted if the rash lasts longer than one week or if the fever, rash or other symptoms worsen instead of getting better. A doctor should be called immediately if the symptoms become so severe at any point that the child or caregiver cannot cope with them.",Roseola infantum FAQs,"Q: Can adults get roseola?
A: Adults can get roseola, but this is rare. Due to previous exposure, most adults are immune to the virus. If an adult does contract roseola, the symptoms are usually milder than in infants or children.","Q: Is roseola contagious?
A: Yes, the viruses that cause roseola, herpes virus 6 or 7, are contagious. They are spread through droplets of fluid released when a person coughs or sneezes, for example. Contact with these droplets, e.g. through inhaling them, can lead to the virus being transmitted from one person to another.","Q: Can you get roseola more than once?
A: Yes, but this is rare. It is most likely to occur in people with a weakened immune system.","Q: How can one tell the difference between roseola and measles?
A: The rashes associated with roseola and measles are frequently confused, but they have different appearances. The roseola rash is pinkish-red and typically begins on the trunk (belly and back), then spreads to the extremities and sometimes the face. The spots are distinct and may be surrounded by a white ring. The roseola rash develops when the fever disappears and typically clears within a couple of days. The measles rash, on the other hand, is brownish-red and usually spreads from the face down to the rest of the body, with the spots running into each other and creating a blotchy or bumpy appearance. When the rash appears, a person may develop a high fever and feel very unwell. The rash typically persists for 5-6 days.[4][18][19][20]",Read more about measles »,"Q: Is roseola related to chickenpox or shingles?
A: The viruses that cause roseola, chickenpox and shingles are all members of the large herpesviridae family of viruses. The viruses, therefore, are related, but not the same. Although the conditions share some common symptoms, such as fever and tiredness, they also differ in several ways, including in their severity and the treatment options available.","Q: When can a child with roseola return to school?
A: A child with roseola can usually return to school and other activities after their temperature has returned to normal[11] and they feel well again.[8] A healthcare practitioner can advise on the best time of return for each child.","Q: Is a pregnant person at risk of passing roseola on to her fetus?
A: Most adults are immune to roseola infection due to previous exposure. Even if a pregnant person does contract roseola, the risk that they will pass it on to their unborn baby, or that it will cause complications for the fetus, appears to be very low.[21][22]",Other names for roseola infantum,"

However, the rubella virus can cause serious birth defects if caught by a pregnant person; this is referred to as congenital rubella syndrome.[1]","Vaccination programs have had success in reducing the number of cases of rubella worldwide. According to The World Health Organization, several countries have eradicated rubella and congenital rubella syndrome altogether because of their vaccination programs.[2]","Rubella was eliminated in the United States in 2004. Now, approximately 10 cases of rubella are reported in the U.S. every year. These rare cases are caused by people coming into contact with the virus while traveling abroad.[3]",Symptoms of rubella,"Many people will experience no symptoms at all when they contract rubella. If symptoms do appear, they will usually present at around two to three weeks after the initial infection.

Women in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, who do not have immunity to rubella, should not travel to areas where rubella is present.[13]",Diagnosing rubella,"Symptoms such as a rash and swollen glands may indicate rubella, but a blood or saliva test is the only way to definitively diagnose infection. The blood test is sometimes referred to as an antibody titer test, which is a way of measuring antibodies in a blood sample.[15]",Blood and saliva tests for rubella check for antibody levels in the body. There are two types of antibody that indicate rubella:[6][16],"
IgM antibody: this antibody will be present if someone has recently been infected with rubella. IgM antibodies can be detected a few days after the rash first occurs.
IgG antibody: this antibody will be present if someone has been vaccinated against rubella or has been infected in the past. A diagnosis using the IgG antibody needs a test as close as possible to the initial phase of infection, the results of which are compared to a further test two to three weeks later.
","If rubella is suspected, always contact the doctor before visiting the surgery. Rubella is contagious, and the doctor will likely want to prepare for the visit to limit the risk of infecting others.",Rubella and pregnancy,"The health risks posed by rubella are most severe if the affected person is in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, as the virus can cause serious birth defects and health problems to the baby.

This occurs as a result of disorganized or overactive brain activity. Schizophrenia tends to first occur during the teenage years or in early adulthood. The symptoms and severity of schizophrenia can vary widely from person to person, and often begin with subtle symptoms, such as withdrawing from social life and decreased motivation, as well as developing strange beliefs or hearing and seeing things which are not real. Diagnosis is usually made by a psychiatrist. Management is usually provided by an experienced team and involves medication and support. Early diagnosis and good management gives the best chance of a full recovery.",Risks,"Schizophrenia occurs when there is a disturbance in the chemicals responsible for the brain's messaging system. The cause of schizophrenia is not well understood, but it's probable that several factors combine to cause this condition. This includes problems that occur during birth, the use of some drugs and experiencing stressful or traumatic events. There may be a genetic cause, as schizophrenia tends to run in families. Most people with schizophrenia will begin to have symptoms in their teenage years, and most people are diagnosed between the ages of 15 and 35. Schizophrenia can affect both men and women.",Symptoms,"The symptoms of schizophrenia can vary greatly from person to person. In the early stages, the symptoms are often frightening, and the affected person may not tell anyone that these are occuring. Generally speaking, there are two groups of symptoms in schizophrenia. The first type includes the better known symptoms of schizophrenia, such as hearing, feeling or seeing things that are not real, and having strange, strongly held beliefs. Other symptoms include speaking in an illogical, confused fashion, and acting erraticlly and disorganized. The less dramatic symptoms are possibly more common, though not as well known. These include avoiding social life, disorganized behavior, decreased motivation, a decrease in emotional response, and slowed thinking and movements. The symptoms of schizophrenia often interfere severely with everyday life.",Diagnosis,"The diagnosis is made by an experienced doctor or psychiatrist based on the symptoms. Talking to people close to the affected person is also helpful in confirming the diagnosis. It is important to exclude other causes for the symptoms, and this may involve blood tests and scans of the head.",Treatment,"The management of schizophrenia takes place in a supportive team of health workers. It involves controlling the symptoms, and providing emotional and psychological support and help to get back to everyday life. People with symptoms of schizophrenia can be treated at home, or if the symptoms are very severe, in a hospital. Antipsychotic medications help to slow down the activity in the brain that produces the symptoms of schizophrenia. These may be tablets or injections, and may be taken for 1 to 2 years after the diagnosis, or longer if needed.

Sexual contact
From mother to fetus in utero
Via blood transfusions
Contact with a syphilis sore in a non-genital region (although this is rare)
Needle sharing amongst injecting drug users
","It can be spread by any sexual activity, making it a sexually transmitted infection (STI). Syphilis can be spread by oral sex, anal sex and vaginal sex, as well as any other genital contact and sharing of sex toys. Sharing food and drinks, towels and toilet seats with people who have syphilis is considered safe, as is hugging, holding hands, coughing and sneezing.[4] It is possible for syphilis to be spread by kissing, if the infected individual has a syphilis sore in the mouth, however this is rare.",It is also possible for mothers to transmit syphilis to their babies in utero. This is known as congenital syphilis.,"Other treponemal diseases caused by Treponema pallidum are related to syphilis but are not spread by sexual contact. These include yaws (caused by subspecies pertenue), bejel (subspecies endemicum) and pinta (caused by subspecies carateum) which all affect the skin or bones.[5][6]","Syphilis used to be much more common than it is today, but after the introduction of treatment with the antibiotic penicillin after World War Two, the number of people with syphilis dropped globally. However, since the beginning of the twenty-first century,  the incidence (how many people are newly reported as having syphilis) is rising in the West, mostly due to unsafe sexual practices. Currently, there are about 10.6 million cases of syphilis worldwide.[7]","Syphilis is a concern among all groups, as it is a major risk factor for passing on HIV. The incidence of syphilis is rising most sharply among men who have sex with men (MSM): between 2015 and 2016, the reported number of cases of syphilis rose 18% in the UK, and more than half of these cases were among men who have sex with men. In the USA, according to the Centers for Disease Control, approximately half of men who have sex with men who have syphilis are also HIV-positive, and men who are HIV-negative but do have syphilis are more likely to contract HIV in the future.[8] This is generally believed to be the result of higher rates of unprotected sexual practice in this group, rather than the type of sexual activity  itself. Unprotected sexual contact is inadvisable regardless of sexual orientation.",The stages of syphilis,Syphilis has four stages:[7],"Primary syphilis is the initial stage of infection, in which a flat, painless ulcer develops at the site of infection. This ulcer is called a chancre. [1] It usually appears between 10 and 90 days after contact with an infected individual, and heals on its own after two to twelve weeks (although the affected person remains infectious). [3].","Secondary syphilis follows two to ten weeks after primary syphilis. It has many symptoms, including a distinctive rash. The rash is usually at its worst between three and four months after infection.[3] This phase can last between one and six months.","Latent syphilis, early and late. In early latent syphilis, the infected person is asymptomatic (has no symptoms) but is still infectious. In late latent syphilis, the person is less infectious. The latent phase may last for up to 25 years in some cases, although not all individuals will have a latent stage.[3]","Tertiary syphilis can occur from 3 to 15 years after the initial infection, and is when the affected individual develops complications from long term infection. The complications can include severe neurological and cardiovascular effects. In this stage soft, rounded tumor-like areas of inflammation called gummas can also appear.[7]",Secondary syphilis,"Secondary syphilis appears only after the symptoms of primary syphilis have passed, usually around two to ten weeks after the primary chancre has appeared. About one in four people who have untreated primary syphilis will develop secondary syphilis.","In secondary syphilis, the affected person experiences a generalized infection. This secondary phase, if left untreated, lasts for up to six months, with symptoms recurring during that period. Without treatment, the symptoms will, in most cases, resolve spontaneously, but the infected person will then progress into the latent or tertiary phase of the disease.[9]",Symptoms of secondary syphilis,"Secondary syphilis is a generalized infection affecting the entire body, so it has a number of possible symptoms. People with syphilis may show some or all of these. Common symptoms include:[1][4][10][7][9][3][11]","
A painless, non-itchy rash, which is generally bilaterally symmetrical (the same on both sides)
Swollen lymph nodes in the neck, armpits and groin
Headaches
Malaise, aches and pains
A mild fever
Loss of appetite
Nausea
Sore throat
Neck stiffness
","The rash is the most distinctive symptom of secondary syphilis. It can take many forms, including:[10][7][9]","
A red or pink skin rash, turning reddish-brown. This rash may be very faint. It can occur on the soles of the feet, the palms of the hands, and on the face. In some cases this rash may spread to cover the entire body. It is generally not itchy.
Flat, soft growths around moist, warm areas of the body, such as the vagina and anus. These are known as condylomata lata and are sometimes confused with genital warts. They may be pink or grey. These growths are not painful or itchy, and often disappear spontaneously. They may also occur on other mucus membranes.[10][7][9]
White patches on the roof of the mouth and the tongue.

Periostitis (inflammation of membranes around bones)
Anterior uveitis (inflammation inside the middle layer of the eye)
",Diagnosing secondary syphilis,"The process of diagnosing secondary syphilis will typically include taking the person’s medical history to assess whether they have been at risk of infection, as well as examining any physical symptoms they are showing. However, laboratory tests are the only way to be sure whether or not a person has acquired the infection. Situations in which tests are especially necessary include:[10][9]","
If the affected person thinks they may have symptoms
If they have recently had unprotected sex with a new partner
If they or their partner have had unprotected sex with other partners
If they have another STI, for example gonorrhea or chlamydia
If they are HIV-positive.
If their partner has disclosed that they have an STI
If they are pregnant or planning to become pregnant
If the affected person is a man who has sex with men
If they have previously had syphilis
","It is important to test as soon as possible. However as syphilis does not always show up in results if the infection is very recent, re-testing at a later date may be necessary. Even people who are asymptomatic should be tested if they have been at high risk of having acquired or passed on syphilis. Infected people should also be tested for HIV, and ideally a full STI panel, where tests are done for a range of STIs, should be ordered as well.",Tests for syphilis,"There are a number of laboratory tests for syphilis. The diagnosis of syphilis is usually made by taking a blood test to screen for the disease, followed by another test or tests to confirm its presence. Tests are done on blood as well as body fluids. The most important screening tests are:[12]","
Venereal disease laboratory test (VDRL) including an Immunoglobulin M (IgM) test
Treponema pallidum hemagglutination assay (TPHA)
Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay (TPPA)
","To confirm the presence of syphilis, a fluorescent treponemal antibody absorbed test (FTA-abs) may be administered. This test, and the tests listed above, all work by detecting antibodies - particles produced by the body’s immune system in response to syphilis infection. The exact tests used and the order they are used in depends on the laboratory.","Self-test kits are available, but are not very accurate. It is advisable to seek assistance from a sexual health clinic, hospital or doctor’s office.",Treatment of secondary syphilis,"Syphilis is easily treated using the antibiotic penicillin. Primary, secondary and latent syphilis can all be treated with penicillin, but it is most effective in the primary and secondary phases.[7] Latent syphilis infection can be cured by penicillin, but any organ damage already sustained from longterm infection cannot be undone The same is true of tertiary syphilis.","In patients who are allergic to penicillin, doxycycline and ceftriaxone may be used. Because of increasing antibiotic resistance, azithromycin is no longer very effective.",Treatment does not prevent future re-infection. It is very important that people receiving treatment for syphilis adhere to their treatment regime and abstain from unprotected sexual activity.[1],"When treating syphilis, most physicians prefer to use parenteral (administered by injection) treatment rather than oral treatment, as injecting medication tends to happen under medical supervision, which may mean that the patient has a better chance of adhering to the treatment regime.","The first line of treatment for syphilis is an intramuscular (into the muscle) injection of a single dose of of benzathine penicillin. An alternative treatment is Doxycycline, for patients who are allergic to penicillin[7].","Improvement is experienced shortly after treatment begins, but the time to complete recovery varies according to how long the infection has been present. Follow-up blood tests are required to check if the treatment has been effective.",Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction,"Between half and three-quarters of people  being treated with antibiotics for syphilis have an unpleasant set of short-term symptoms known as the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction, which occurs several hours after beginning treatment.[3]  As the treponemal bacteria die they release inflammatory substances, and these are responsible for the body’s reaction. [7][13] Symptoms can include fever, muscle pain, headache and rapid heartbeat.","People suffering from this reaction can take aspirin or ibuprofen, and should not be left alone in case complications develop, such as panic attacks, faintness, etc. If complications do develop, seek medical help.The condition usually passes within 24 hours, and it not usually considered to be dangerous.",Preventing secondary syphilis,"Using a condom can significantly reduce the risk of passing on or catching syphilis from a sexual partner. Since the bacteria responsible for syphilis are transferred through skin abrasions or infected mucous membranes, barrier protection is an effective method of preventing transmission. In primary syphilis, it is important to cover the chancre (the small, painless genital ulcer) with a condom or dental dam if engaging in sexual activity.[8] Additionally, users of intravenous drugs should not share needles.",Secondary syphilis FAQs,"Q: Can one contract syphilis from sharing sex toys? 
A: Yes. If one’s sexual partner has syphilis and they share sex toys, one may contract syphilis. The risk of this can be reduced by using condoms on sex toys, with a new condom for each partner, and cleaning the toys thoroughly between uses, using soap and water or a dedicated toy cleaning solution.[1] Using the correct type of lubricant is important to toy hygiene, as using the incorrect type will cause damage to the toy’s surface, making it more difficult to clean. Manufacturers usually advise about the correct cleaning and lubrication procedures for their toys.","Q: Should people who are asymptomatic but suspect they may have syphilis seek testing? 
A: If you think you have been exposed to syphilis through a sexual or intimate partner, but do not have symptoms, it is highly recommended that you are tested. Some people with syphilis show no symptoms, and their infection is only discovered during routine STI screening.[12] Testing is important if you might fall pregnant, or have multiple sexual partners.","Q: Can I have secondary syphilis without having had primary syphilis? 
A: No. The infection is sequential, so everyone with secondary syphilis has had primary syphilis, although it may have been asymptomatic. However, if you seek treatment for secondary syphilis and the treatment is successful, you will not develop latent or tertiary syphilis unless you contract syphilis again.",Other names for secondary syphilis,"

,,,,,,,,,,What is sepsis?,"Sepsis is a whole-body response to an infection in the blood. This severe condition is also known as blood poisoning. Sepsis occurs when an infection spreads from one location (for example, the lungs, the bladder or the skin) into the blood. Elderly people and people with other medical conditions are at higher risk of getting this condition. The main symptoms include fever, chills, confusion, rapid pulse and drowsiness. Sepsis needs to be urgently treated in a hospital, and is treated with antibiotics and fluids.",Risks,"Elderly people are at higher risk of developing sepsis, though it can affect people of every age. People with some medical conditions, such as cancer, a weakened immune system or diabetes, are at increased risk of this condition. Sepsis occurs when an infection spreads from one location (for example, the lungs, the bladder or the skin) into the blood. This causes a whole-body response, as the immune system tries to fight the infection.",Symptoms,"Symptoms of sepsis are fever or feeling cold, chills, a strong feeling of illness, drowsiness, a fast pulse, fast breathing and confusion. As the sepsis gets worse, people may have very cold and blue hands and feet, urinate less and lose consciousness altogether. There are also signs of the underlying infection. These vary depending on where the infection has begun.",Diagnosis,"Diagnosis is often made from the appearance and physical examination of the affected person. Blood tests are taken to prove that an infection is the cause of the symptoms, to check the function of organs that might be affected by sepsis and to identify the cause of sepsis.",Treatment,Sepsis is a life-threatening condition which must be treated in a hospital. Sepsis is treated by giving antibiotics against the cause of the infection and fluids to increase blood pressure. The cause of the original infection should be identified and treated or removed.,Prevention,"It is important that infections (such as pneumonia, bladder infections, skin infections), are assessed early by a doctor and treated with antibiotics. People who are at increased risk of vaccine-preventable infections (such as the elderly, and people with other medical conditions) should make sure they keep their vaccinations up to date."
,,,,,,,,,,What is septic arthritis?
,,,,,,,,,,What is septic arthritis?,"Septic arthritis, also known as infectious arthritis or pyogenic arthritis, is a very rare condition caused by an infection in the joint. It is usually caused by bacteria, though it may be caused by other microorganisms. Incidence is about six per 100,000 of the population in any given year.[1]","The condition can affect anyone but it is most common in those with underlying joint disease or prosthetic joints, and more common in older people and those with diabetes or a weakened immune system. Any joint may be affected, but septic arthritis is most common in the knee and hip, sometimes also occurring in the shoulder, elbow and ankle.","Symptoms usually develop quickly, over a few hours or days, and include pain, redness, swelling, heat and difficulty moving in the affected joint or joints. Many people will develop a fever. If the infection spreads, a person may also develop nausea, dizziness or drowsiness.","Septic arthritis occurs when infectious microorganisms reach the inside of the joints, most commonly entering the joints directly, for instance during joint replacement surgery. Infection in the bloodstream can also cause this condition if it spreads to the joints.",A diagnosis is confirmed when a fluid sample from the affected joint shows that bacteria or other infectious agents are present.,"Septic arthritis is treated with antibiotics delivered into a vein, normally in a hospital stay of two weeks or more, followed by further antibiotics taken orally at home. Fluid may also be drawn from the infected joint using a needle and syringe.","Septic arthritis normally occurs in just one joint, but polyarticular septic arthritis, in which multiple joints throughout the body are infected, is also possible.","Good to know: It is very important to seek medical attention immediately if septic arthritis is suspected. The condition can rapidly cause irreversible joint damage and, left untreated, can be life threatening. However, with prompt treatment, most people will recover well.",Symptoms,The most common symptoms of septic arthritis are localized to the affected joint as a result of inflammation and include:[2][3],"
Redness of the overlying skin
Swelling
Pain
Stiffness and difficulty moving
Heat
Inability to bear weight
","Many people will also feel generally unwell, with symptoms that may include:[4][5]","
Fever
Nausea
Vomiting
Dizziness
Drowsiness
","In most people with septic arthritis, the onset of symptoms occurs very quickly, within a few hours or days.","In about half of cases, the knee is affected.[2] Other commonly affected joints include the hip, shoulder, elbow, ankle and, in the case of intravenous drug users, sternoclavicular joint between the collarbone and breastbone.",It is very important to seek medical attention immediately if septic arthritis is suspected. The Ada app can also give you an initial symptom assessment.,Causes,"Septic arthritis is caused by bacteria entering the joint. This can occur indirectly by entering the body through, for example, a wound and traveling through the bloodstream to a joint, or by directly entering a joint, such as through injury or surgery.","As soon as bacteria invade the bloodstream, the body begins an immune response. White blood cells and joint lining cells may attempt to surround and digest the bacteria. The chemical signals sent out by these cells contribute to the characteristic inflammation of septic arthritis, which can cause destruction of cartilage. Depending on the infecting organism, the level of inflammatory response and joint destruction varies.","Most commonly, septic arthritis occurs in connection with a prosthetic joint replacement. Prosthetic implant infection most often results from local infection, and may enter the joint during the joint replacement procedure. Bacteria may also enter the bloodstream at another site and travel to the joint, which may be more susceptible to infection as it heals.[6]",Risk factors,Risk factors for developing septic arthritis include:[2][7],"
Age of 80 or above: 45 percent of those affected are older than 65
Prosthetic implant, such as artificial knee or hip, or other recent joint surgery
Diabetes
Prior joint damage, particularly from rheumatoid arthritis or gout
Liver cirrhosis: liver scarring due to conditions such as hepatitis and chronic alcoholism
HIV and AIDS or otherwise compromised immune system
Recent blood infection
Intravenous drug use
Gonorrhea infection

These include:[3][8]","A blood test: This may reveal an elevated white blood cell count, which is normally found in cases of septic arthritis. Abnormally high levels of certain markers in the blood would also support a diagnosis that symptoms are caused by an inflammatory condition such as septic arthritis. Inflammatory markers which may be detected by a blood test include:","
C-reactive protein (CRP)
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR or sed rate)
","However, these tests come back normal in many cases of septic arthritis, so cannot be relied upon to rule out the condition.","Joint fluid aspiration: Joint fluid is drawn using a needle, and examined for the presence of infection to confirm diagnosis and to identify any organism found.",Medical imaging,"A doctor may also recommend an X-ray, CT scan, ultrasound or MRI scan of the affected joint. This can help with diagnosis of septic arthritis and any complications. However, at an early stage of septic arthritis, there may not be any visible joint damage.[9]",Treatment,There are five main aspects of septic arthritis treatment:[10][11],Antibiotics: Septic arthritis infection must be cleared with antibiotics delivered into a vein,"Draining the joint: This may be done to clear any infected fluid from the joint. This will either be done using a needle and syringe or by arthroscopy, in which a thin, metal tube is inserted through a small cut made near the affected joint.",Pain relief: This is important to retain joint mobility,"Physiotherapy: Most people will require a lot of physiotherapy to maximize functioning of the joint after infection has cleared, to promote healing and prevent permanent muscle shortening","In some cases, surgery: Occasionally, this may be done to clean the joints. If the septic arthritis followed a joint replacement surgery, the joint replacement itself may need removal.","Good to know: Treatment normally involves a hospital stay of two weeks or more, followed by further antibiotics taken orally at home, normally for at least four more weeks.",Complications,"If septic arthritis is left untreated, serious complications may arise. These may include:[^13][12]","
Osteomyelitis, a painful bone infection and inflammation

",FAQs,"Q: Is septic arthritis the same condition as reactive arthritis?
A: No, septic arthritis is not the same as reactive arthritis. In septic arthritis, infection is present within the joint. Reactive arthritis is an autoimmune response triggered by infection, but the infection is not located in the joint. Reactive arthritis generally lasts from a few weeks to a few months and, while its severity may vary, it normally resolves without serious complications. Septic arthritis can lead to disability and, left untreated, may be life threatening. In septic arthritis, the infection is treated with intravenous antibiotics. In reactive arthritis, oral antibiotics may be used to treat the triggering infection, but this does not shorten the duration of joint symptoms.",Read more about Reactive Arthritis »,"Q: Osteomyelitis vs septic arthritis - what is the difference?
A: Osteomyelitis is infection of the bone, whereas septic arthritis is infection of a joint. Both may have similar causes, such as knife wounds or biting, and may spread through the blood from another location. Osteomyelitis and septic arthritis may also co-exist if, for example, infection spreads from the joint to the bone. Both conditions may have similar symptoms, such as pain in the affected area and fever, so can be mistaken for one another. Both conditions are rare, but can be life threatening if left untreated, so early diagnosis and treatment with drainage and intravenous antibiotics are important[14]","Q: Septic arthritis vs gout - what is the difference?
A: Gout may present in a similar manner to septic arthritis, with acute pain, swelling, warmth, and decreased range of motion, normally starting in a single joint. However, both conditions have very different causes, treatments and outcomes. Gout is caused when there is buildup of uric acid in the blood that deposits urate crystals in a joint, causing a painful immune response, whereas septic arthritis is caused by infection in a joint. Septic arthritis may be life threatening if left untreated. Gout, while it may be acutely painful and, if it develops into a chronic condition, can cause joint damage, it is not life threatening. It is important to seek medical attention immediately, for appropriate treatment.[15]",Read more about Gout »
,,,,,,,,,,What is sickle cell disease?
,,,,,,,,,,What is sickle cell disease?,Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an umbrella term for a group of genetic disorders affecting the body’s red blood cells.,"People with SCD have atypical hemoglobin, a protein within red blood cells that helps circulate oxygen throughout the body – known as hemoglobin S or sickle hemoglobin – which causes their red blood cells to become misshapen. As a result, these red blood cells break down more quickly than usual and can block small blood vessels, cutting off the oxygen supply to certain tissues and causing complications.[1]","SCD is typically a serious and lifelong condition, requiring long-term treatment and management. The disorder is most common in people of African, Caribbean, Middle Eastern, Eastern Mediterranean and Asian origin.[2]",Types of sickle cell disease,There are seven main subtypes of sickle cell disease:[3][^10][4],"
HbSS (commonly known as sickle cell anemia)
HbSC
HbS beta-thalassemia
HbSD
HbSE
HbSO
HbAS
","In all of these subtypes, “Hb” stands for “hemoglobin”. All sickle cell diseases are hereditary hemoglobinopathies, which means that a person has inherited genetic deformations of hemoglobin from one or both parents.[4] Most of these subtypes don’t have “common” names and are therefore usually called by their abbreviations. The exception is sickle cell anemia.","HbSS, or sickle cell anemia, is the most common subtype of sickle cell disease. In this subtype, the affected person inherits one sickle-cell gene from each parent. This is called a homozygous sickle cell disease.[^10]","In HbSC, the affected person inherits a sickle-cell gene from one parent and a gene for a defective form of hemoglobin, hemoglobin-C, from the other.[4]","HbS beta-thalassemia comes in two forms, beta 0-thalassemia, which is quite severe, and beta +-thalassemia, which is milder. These occur when the affected person has inherited a sickle-cell gene from one parent and a beta-thalassemia gene from the other.[3][^10]","HbSD, HbSE and HbSO are rarer subtypes of sickle cell disease. In these subtypes, the affected person has inherited a sickle-cell gene from one parent and a gene for a defective form of hemoglobin (Hemoglobin D, E or O) from the other. The severity of these subtypes varies.[3]","Individuals who have only inherited a sickle-cell gene from one parent and no abnormal genes from the other have what is known as sickle-cell trait.[4] In these cases, they are unaffected by the abnormal gene but may pass on a risk of sickle-cell disease to their children.[3] If two people with sickle-cell trait have children, those children have a one in four chance of having sickle-cell disease, a one in four chance of being completely unaffected, and a one in two chance of being an unaffected carrier themselves.","If you suspect you or a loved one may have sickle cell disease, you can get a free symptom assessment by downloading the Ada app.",Symptoms of sickle cell disease,"The symptoms of SCD are typically intermittent, meaning they are experienced in episodes that come and go. Symptoms also tend to vary in frequency and severity from person to person and may change over time. They can occur in conditions that cause hypoxia, such as intense physical exertion.",Symptoms of SCD may include:[5][6][7],Painful episodes,"Episodes of pain – also known as sickle cell crises – are one of the most common symptoms of SCD. The pain can vary in severity and may come on suddenly. Most often it is felt in the bones and joints, though it may also occur in other locations, such as the hands, feet, arms, legs or abdomen. Any area with both sensory nerves and blood supply can be affected during a painful episode. Many people with SCD experience chronic, low-level pain, often in bones and joints.","Painful episodes are caused by sickle-shaped cells blocking blood vessels and cutting off the oxygen supply to tissues. Although it is not clear what brings on these episodes, it is thought that changes in the weather, dehydration, stress and strenuous exercise can all act as triggers.",Acute chest syndrome,"Acute chest syndrome occurs when blood vessels in the lungs become blocked, typically causing chest pain, a high temperature, coughing and shortness of breath. It should be treated as a medical emergency requiring urgent treatment. Symptoms of acute chest syndrome are:","
Chest pain, most common in adults
Coughing
Shortness of breath, most common in adults
Fever, more common in children
","The cause of acute chest syndrome may be multifactorial and may include factors, such as:","
Infection
Blocked blood vessels
Shallow inhalation, which can lead to poor ventilation in the lung
Obstruction of blood supply (infarction) to the ribs
",Infections,People with SCD are susceptible to severe infection from certain types of bacteria. Common types of infection include:,"
Blood infection, also known as septicemia
Lung infection, also known as pneumonia
Infection of the surroundings of the brain and the spine, also known as bacterial meningitis
Bone infection, also known as osteomyelitis
","Good to know: Infection, particularly in infants, should be treated as a medical emergency requiring urgent treatment.",Severe anemia,"People with SCD will normally also experience mild to moderate anemia, a lack of hemoglobin. Periodically, however, this anemia can become severe and require urgent medical attention. This may occur suddenly or more gradually.",Signs and symptoms of the onset of severe anemia include:,"

","If you are concerned your infant is displaying signs of sickle cell disease, you can use the Ada app to start a free symptom assessment.",Causes of sickle cell disease,"SCD is caused by a gene defect which creates atypical hemoglobin, known as hemoglobin S or sickle hemoglobin. Hemoglobin S behaves differently to normal hemoglobin, typically changing the shape of red blood cells from their usual spherical, donut-like shape, into a crescent or sickle-like shape.","These deformed red blood cells tend to deplete faster than usual, causing anemia, and can block blood vessels, leading to a reduced supply of oxygen to the body’s tissues.[5]",How is sickle cell disease inherited?,"If an individual inherits two hemoglobin S genes from their parents, that person may develop SCD. This may also be the case if an individual inherits one hemoglobin S gene plus another type of abnormal hemoglobin gene, such as thalassemia, hemoglobin C, hemoglobin D or hemoglobin E.[8]","If an individual inherits one hemoglobin S gene and one normal hemoglobin gene from their parents, they will have something known as sickle cell trait and become a carrier of sickle cell disease. People with sickle cell trait, however, will generally be healthy and only rarely display signs or symptoms associated with SCD. These symptoms can occur during intense exercise or physical exertion.",Diagnosing sickle cell disease,"SCD is normally diagnosed following blood tests. To make the diagnosis, a blood sample will be taken and analysed in order to establish what type of hemoglobin is present.","If the results prove inconclusive or there is any uncertainty, DNA tests may also be carried out.[9]",Diagnosing sickle cell disease in newborn babies,"In many places, tests for sickle cell disease are carried out on newborn babies as part of the routine postnatal screening process. To do this, a blood sample will be collected from a heel prick and sent to a laboratory for testing.","Parents will be informed of the results of the testing as soon as possible. If the results return positive for SCD, a second round of testing will be ordered to definitively confirm the diagnosis. If confirmed, parents will have treatment options thoroughly explained to them.","Good to know: Postnatal tests will also be able to show whether or not a newborn has a sickle cell trait. This is important, as it may increase the chances of a sibling or the child’s future children inheriting the disorder.[10]",Prenatal sickle cell disease diagnosis,Tests can also be carried out prior to birth to see whether a child will inherit SCD. This is usually done by using tissue from the placenta or amniotic fluid from the sac surrounding the embryo and can be carried out from around 8 to 10 weeks into the course of a pregnancy.,Sickle cell disease treatment,"A number of treatment methods are available to manage the symptoms of SCD and prevent complications. However, in most cases, the **disorder cannot be cured and will **require lifelong management.","People with SCD will be treated by a specialist and will be required to attend check-ups at regular intervals. They will also be taught how to recognise the condition’s symptoms, so that treatment can be given as soon as possible after they appear.",Staying healthy is an important principle of managing SCD. This will often involve:[5],"
Antibiotics. Taking daily doses of antibiotics, usually penicillin, is often recommended by doctors, particularly for children of five years of age or younger. This is aimed at preventing infection.
Vaccinations. People with SCD, especially children, should ensure they keep up-to-date with all recommended vaccinations, including those against meningitis, influenza and hepatitis B.
Vitamin supplements. Extra folic acid supplements are commonly recommended for people with SCD to aid the body in its production of red blood cells. A daily supplement containing zinc, Vitamins D, E, C and A, magnesium, selenium, carotenoids and flavonoids, but not iron, may also be useful.
",Treating painful episodes,Most mild to moderate painful episodes (sickle cell crises) will not require a visit to the hospital and can be treated at home. This may involve:,"
Painkillers, usually paracetamol or ibuprofen
Staying hydrated by drinking plenty of water
Antibiotics. These are strongly recommended for children of younger than five, but are optional for older individuals. Should a fever develop, the individual should receive prompt medical attention regardless of whether or not they are on antibiotics
","If a painful episode is severe, professional medical attention should be sought as soon as possible. If fever appears, medical attention should be sought right away: fever is a medical emergency in people with SCD.",Hydroxyurea therapy,"In people with frequent and severe pain resulting from SCD, hydroxyurea treatment is currently the standard. Hydroxyurea increases the concentration of functioning hemoglobin. This in turn reduces painful episodes and acute chest syndrome, as well as the need for hospitalization and the number of blood transfusions a person with SCD may need.[11]",Blood transfusions,"A blood transfusion can be used to treat acute chest syndrome or severe anemia, as well as to prevent or treat certain complications. Blood transfusions, however, are not considered routine due to the complications they can cause, meaning they are only carried out when considered absolutely necessary.",Treatment to prevent clotting is recommended for all adults with SCD admitted to hospital.,Stem cell transplant,"A stem cell transplant is the only known way to cure SCD. It does, however, come with the risk of severe complications, and its success is not guaranteed. It is generally reserved for very severe cases of SCD.",Erythrocytapheresis,"Erythrocytapheresis is a method of reducing hemoglobin concentration to less than 30%. In this procedure, red blood cells are removed from a blood sample, and the rest of the blood is introduced to circulation.[12]","In this way, it cuts down the risk of stroke in adults and children from SBC. The treatment has relatively few side effects, all of which can be managed.",Sickle cell disease complications,There are various possible complications that can occur as a result of SCD. Some of the most common complications related to SCD include:,Growth and development problems,Children and adolescents with SCD may experience slowed growth and development. Teenagers may also undergo puberty two to three years later than average. Doctors will monitor childhood development closely and may suggest certain vitamin supplements to help manage possible problems.,Stroke,Strokes are a common complication for children and adolescents with SCD and can occur in adults.,"Sickle cells blocking blood vessels in the brain can shut off the oxygen supply, causing a stroke.

By far the most common types of arthritis are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.","Arthritis is a very common condition: According to the Centers for Disease Control, about one in four adults in the U.S. – 54 million people – have some form and degree of arthritis.[1]","Many forms of arthritis tend to predominantly affect older people, though it can affect people at any age and there are some rare conditions that cause arthritis in children and teenagers.",Many types of arthritis tend to be characterized by which joints are affected and the usual age at which people are affected.,Signs of arthritis,"Signs of early arthritis may come on slowly and mildly, or they may appear suddenly and intensely. Some types of arthritis may start with symptoms that seem unrelated, such as fatigue or a rash. Early signs of arthritis can vary and may be mistaken as the result of excessive amounts of activity or an injury.","Arthritis can be localized in one joint, or it can affect many joints and different structures within a joint, such as the synovium (joint lining), bones, cartilage or supporting tissues. The symptoms can also vary in sensation, severity and frequency. Some forms of arthritis are short-term conditions, while others are long-term and may permanently damage joint function.","Signs of arthritis may vary, depending on the type of arthritis, but there are four key signs that are normally present with arthritis:[2][3]","
Joint pain
Stiffness in the joint(s)
Decreased range of motion in the joint(s)
Swelling in and around the joint(s), though this is a lot more common in rheumatoid arthritis than in osteoarthritis
","Good to know: If experiencing joint symptoms, it is best to seek diagnosis swiftly, as prompt treatment may lessen the progression of the disease.",By far the most common types of arthritis are rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.,Signs of rheumatoid arthritis,"Rheumatoid arthritis, also known as inflammatory arthritis is an autoimmune condition, which usually affects multiple joints. While any joint can be affected, signs of arthritis are most commonly found in the hands, fingers, wrist, shoulders, feet, knees, elbows, lower back and hips.",Signs of rheumatoid arthritis include:[4][5],Pain,Pain associated with inflammatory arthritis is usually a throbbing and aching pain. It is often worse in the mornings and after a period of inactivity.,Stiffness,"Like joint pain, stiffness is more severe in the morning and after periods of inactivity in the case of rheumatoid arthritis, leading to morning stiffness of more than half an hour, and in many people at least an hour - unlike osteoarthritis, where morning stiffness usually disappears within half an hour.",Swelling,"Inflammation causes the joints to appear swollen and red, and warm or hot. In rheumatoid arthritis, some people may develop so-called rheumatoid nodules, which are lumps under the skin around the affected joints.",Other symptoms,"As well as affecting the joints, rheumatoid symptoms may include:[6][7]","
Fever
Rash
Weight loss and loss of appetite
Signs of anemia, such as fatigue
Excessive or more than usual sweating
In the case of the hands being affected: Carpal tunnel syndrome, tingling in the hands caused by nerve compression
","For more information, see the resource on rheumatoid arthritis.",Signs of osteoarthritis,"Degenerative or mechanical arthritis, also known medically as osteoarthritis or osteoarthrosis, is a type of arthritis in which there is damage to the joints through wear and tear. It tends to occur more commonly in older people, but sometimes also occurs in younger people if, for example, they have had substantial injuries and/or surgeries to joints. Usually, osteoarthritis affects one or a few joints, often the weight-bearing joints, causing signs of arthritis in the knees, hands, hips, ankle, shoulder, lower back or the neck.",Signs of osteoarthritis may include:[8][9],Pain,"Pain associated with degenerative arthritis tends to worsen with activity and at the end of the day and is relieved by rest. In more severe cases, the pain may be continuous, even when not moving. It may cause a person to wake up at night. Many people report increased joint pain with rainy weather.",Stiffness,"There may be morning stiffness but, in the case of osteoarthritis, this usually goes away within 30 minutes, unlike rheumatoid arthritis, where this typically lasts substantially longer.",Swelling,"Swelling from osteoarthritis is rarer than in rheumatoid arthritis, but if it occurs, it tends to be caused by thickening of the joint lining and effusion, in which there is extra joint fluid.",Grinding and instability,"As cartilage wears down and disappears, there are sometimes painful grinding or grating sensations when moving  the joints owing to bone-on-bone contact. The tissues and ligaments that hold joints in place may become weaker, leading to joint instability (looseness).",Reduced mobility,"The joint may not move as freely or as far as normal. There may be difficulty with fine motor skills such as gripping and twisting, as is needed to, for example open jars or do crafts.",Other symptoms,"
Muscle wasting around the affected joint
Bone spurs, knobby bone growths
",Joints most commonly affected by arthritis,"Each case of arthritis will have a varying set of symptoms, depending not only on the type of arthritis, but also on which joints are affected. This is because each joint tends to have its own characteristic symptoms. Though any joint may be affected by arthritis, the joints most commonly involved include the hands, fingers, wrists, knees, hips, feet and shoulders, which may be affected as follows:","Signs of arthritis in the hands, fingers and wrists","The joints in the hands and wrist may be the most intricate in the body, able to perform elaborate, yet everyday tasks such as tying one’s shoelace or unscrewing a jar when working well. It can be disabling to lose the fine motor skills of the hand.",Arthritis in the hands normally manifests differently in both of the main types of arthritis.,"Rheumatoid arthritis, which normally manifests in many joints throughout the body, is often first perceptible in the hands.","In rheumatoid arthritis, signs of early arthritis in the hands may include:[10][11]","
A dull, burning sensation in the fingers
Swelling, especially first thing in the morning
Stiffness so that it is hard to grip objects such as keys or a toothbrush
Pain at the wrist and finger knuckles
","Good to know: Early changes of rheumatoid arthritis in fingers may cause dactylitis, an inflammation with swelling of the finger, in which the knuckles may disappear, giving the fingers the appearance of sausages.","In osteoarthritis, arthritis develops gradually over a long period of time, and early signs may go unnoticed or ignored. Signs of osteoarthritis in the hands include:[12][13]","
Mild swelling
Pain deep under the base of the thumb
Bone spurs, knobby bone growths which the body creates in reaction to joint damage
Hand weakness
Carpal tunnel syndrome, a numbness and tingling in the hands and, occasionally, forearms and upper arms
",Signs of arthritis in the knee,"Arthritis of the knee most commonly occurs in osteoarthritis. In rheumatoid arthritis, involvement in large joints, such as the knee, tends to occur in later stages of the condition.",Early signs of arthritis in the knees may include:[14][15],"
Pain, mainly when weight-bearing and moving the knee
A cracking or grating sensation in the knee when going up and down stairs
Bony enlargement of the knees
Deformities of the joint due to ligament damage
Leg muscle wasting
Baker’s cyst or popliteal cyst, in which a cyst develops behind the knee and may rupture
",Signs of arthritis in the hip,"Arthritis of the hip is most common in osteoarthritis, when symptoms develop gradually and are usually most noticeable after inactivity, such as when getting out of bed in the morning. They may also worsen with intense activities such as sports. Arthritis of the hip also occurs in rheumatoid arthritis, often in those with a longer history of the condition.",Hip arthritis symptoms may include:[15][16],"
Aching and stiffness in the groin, buttock or thigh
Pain in the side or back of the hip on weight bearing
Pain may radiate down the thigh and cause knee pain
Reduced mobility of the hip, including difficulty spreading the legs apart, extending the legs, pointing the toes inward
Limping or lurching when walking
",Signs of arthritis in the feet,People with rheumatoid arthritis commonly experience arthritis in the feet. Symptoms of arthritis in the foot may include:[17][18],"
Changing foot shape due to joint damage
Development of enlarged and/or inflamed bursae, fluid-filled sacs where there is excess rubbing, often causing pain under the ball of the foot
Nodules, commonly over the Achilles tendon, in the heel pad and over any bony prominences
Corns and calluses, due to altered foot shape, which can lead to ulcers - open sores on the skin. In the very worst cases, an ulcer may deepen to involve tendons, bones and other deep structures
Numbness and tingling in the feet due to a trapped nerve
In osteoarthritis: stiff big toe joint
",Signs of arthritis in the shoulders,Typical symptoms of shoulder arthritis may include:[19][20],"
Deep ache in the joint
Pain that radiates or travels to the side of the neck
Pain throughout the shoulders in rheumatoid arthritis
Limited range of motion
Grinding, crunching or popping sound as it moves
Pain in the night
",Juvenile arthritis,"Arthritis usually affects older people. More rarely, however, there are various arthritic conditions which may affect children and teenagers.","For more information on signs of juvenile arthritis, see the resource on juvenile idiopathic arthritis.",FAQs,"Q: What is the difference between rheumatoid arthritis and gout?
A: Gout and rheumatoid arthritis are both forms of arthritis that may present with similar symptoms of sudden joint pain. However, they have different causes. The cause of rheumatoid arthritis is not completely understood, though it is known to be an autoimmune, inflammatory condition, in which the body attacks its own tissue. Gout is caused by too much uric acid in the blood, a chemical found in certain foods, which forms urate crystal deposits in the joint, leading to a painful, inflammatory immune reaction, usually starting in the foot, when it is known as podagra. It is important to seek prompt and accurate diagnosis of which type of arthritis is present, as the treatments for each type are very different. For more information, see the resources on podagra - gout of the foot, gout and rheumatoid arthritis."

Autism cannot be cured but therapies and support services can help a person with autism improve symptoms.,What is a spectrum disorder?,"Autism is a spectrum disorder, which means that people can experience a wide range of symptoms and of varying severities. For example, a person with autism who is towards the high functioning range of the spectrum will have a good grasp of language, but a person towards the low functioning range of the spectrum may not speak at all.[2]","As such, it is important to note that a person with autism spectrum disorder will not display all symptoms and symptoms will vary in severity. However, a person with autism will display several of these behaviors and symptoms.",Signs and symptoms of autism,"There are many signs and symptoms that could indicate a person has autism spectrum disorder. Not all children with autism will have every symptom, and some children without autism may display some of the same behaviors and symptoms.","People with autism spectrum disorder often have difficulties with communicating, and connecting emotionally and socially with others. They may also process sensory information, such as sounds and smells, differently from other people. These differences can underlay some of the behavioral signs of autism that people may display.[3][4]","When looking for early signs of autism spectrum disorder, there are developmental milestones that children are expected to reach by certain ages, such as babbling by four months old and being able to use simple sentences by two years old. If a child reaches these milestones later, or does not develop the skills at all, it may indicate a developmental disorder such as autism spectrum disorder.[5]","Autism can be diagnosed by two years old, though symptoms may be apparent much earlier.",Common signs of autism,Some of the more common signs that may indicate a person has autism include:[6],"

Not pointing at distant objects by 14 months
Being upset by relatively minor changes
Unexpected reactions to sounds, tastes and smells
Focusing on or becoming obsessed by particular interests or objects
Engaging in repetitive behavior such as flapping hands or rocking
",Signs of autism in babies,"Autism spectrum disorder is a developmental disorder, which means that signs become apparent as a child does not develop as expected, for example developing speech or learning to crawl later than expected.","As such, there are few signs of autism that are noticeable in newborns. However, if a baby fails to reach developmental milestones expected at two months old, four months old, six months old, nine months old and a year old, this could be a sign of autism or another developmental condition.[5]","Good to know: Not all babies reach developmental milestones at the exact same time. It is normal to have some variation in development. If in doubt about how well a child is developing, check with a doctor.",Some of the early signs that a baby under one year old may have autism spectrum disorder include:[6][7][8],"

","Children with autism spectrum disorder have difficulty interpreting what other people are thinking and feeling, and often miss social cues. A child with autism may not be able to tell the difference between an adult who says “come here” while happy and smiling, and an adult who says “come here” while angry and frowning. This can be confusing and creates the impression the child is not connecting with people.[11]",Good to know: Echolalia is a normal part of many children’s language development and generally goes away by around three years old. Children with autism are more likely to persist with echolalia as they get older.[14],Signs of autism in older children and teenagers,"Although autism spectrum disorder can reliably be diagnosed from the age of two or three years old, many children do not receive a diagnosis until they are older. Milder symptoms in children with autism spectrum disorder who are higher functioning may not be recognized until they are in school.","Autism is a spectrum condition, which means that children will have different experiences of day-to-day living.

,,,,,,,,,,What is burnout?
,,,,,,,,,,What is burnout?,"As a medical term, burnout was coined in 1974 by the psychologist Herbert Freudenberger whilst he was working a job as an unpaid volunteer at a free clinic catering to people experiencing problems with addiction. He used the word burnout to describe the psychological and physiological impact which the stressors of his workplace were having on himself and his coworkers.[1]","Stimulated by continuous stressors related to work at the clinic, which they found to be not only emotionally and physically wearing but often unrewarding, they became burned out and began clearly showing signs and symptoms of being adversely affected in the long-term by this work-related stress, such as fatigue and low morale.","Burnout has since become the go-to term to describe people who are suffering from depression-like symptoms, such as anxiety, headaches, lack of sleep, fatigue and cynicism, which are specifically caused by feeling physically, mentally and emotionally exhausted as a result of stress from one’s job or workplace.","Burnout has been recognized as a possible psychosocial hazard of work; particularly work in high-stress environments; by the World Health Organisation (WHO).[2] However, some doctors and researchers contest the idea that the symptoms of being burned out from work-related stress are unique enough for it to be regarded as a fully-fledged medical condition in its own right, arguing that it is merely a subtype of depression.[3] See this resource for more information about the signs of depression.","Doctors[4] and teachers[5] are among the types of employees who are most commonly experience work-related stress, leading to being diagnosed with burnout. However, experiencing work-related stress, becoming burned out and feeling overwhelmed to the point of ill-health due to the demands of one’s job or work environment can happen to anyone at any age.",Symptoms of burnout,"Spotting the signs of burnout in a coworker, employee, family member or friend can be difficult, as the condition can develop over weeks or months as their response to work-related stress evolves. The symptoms to look out for may be different for every person. For instance, two coworkers may respond to the same stressors in different ways; one may become burned out and the other may not, or they may both become burned out, displaying different signs and symptoms.",People affected by burnout from work-related stress may present with some or all of the following psychological symptoms:[4][5][6],"

There are some key differences between the signs and symptoms of stress and burnout, as described in Harvard’s Helpguide:[9]","Stress causes an employee to overengage with their work environment. Feeling anxiety that their productivity levels are not high enough, they will display symptoms like hyperactive, urgent behaviour, perhaps standing out from their coworkers.[10] In contrast, an employee who has experienced work-related stress to the point of becoming burned out will exhibit symptoms like disengagement and a lack of productivity, due to feeling detached from their work environment.","The damage to the health of an employee, from stress, is primarily physical; an employee who is experiencing stress continually is at increased risk of neurological and physical changes, due to having elevated levels of stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline. Symptoms of stress which an employee may display and experience include a decreased sex drive, insomnia and muscle tension.[9]","An employee who has burned out has already been affected by these stress levels for weeks or months, during which time they will increasingly lose their energy. They are unlikely to experience new physical symptoms related to the ongoing work-related stressors that have caused them to burn out, and the physical symptoms of burnout are those of ongoing stress. Instead, the symptoms a person who is burned out will experience are primarily psychological, related to feeling increasingly listless and unmotivated in the workplace.[9]","In general, becoming burned out follows on from experiencing a prolonged period of work-related stress. This means that both the physical symptoms of burnout, such as gastrointestinal disorders, and the psychological symptoms, such as cynicism, are likely to build up gradually over time, before a person, or their coworkers, family and friends, begin to realise that they have become burned out.[9][10]",Subtypes of burnout,"Every individual’s experience of burnout is unique, and treatment may require a specially tailored approach, taking into account a person’s life circumstances and medical and professional history. However, researchers have categorised the way people respond to chronic work-related stress into three main types: frenetic, underchallenged and worn-out.[11]","
Frenetic burnout occurs when people channel so much energy into their work, often as a result of anxiety, that the rewards of the role must eventually begin to seem negatively disproportionate to the effort they invest. Disregarding the concept of a work/life balance in order to channel maximum energy one’s work is common. Burnout occurs when a person works at an intensity to the point of exhaustion.[11]
Underchallenged burnout occurs when a person feels trapped in a monotonous and unstimulating work environment, performing a role which does not provide job satisfaction. This contributes to an overall lowering of their mood.[11]
Worn-out burnout occurs when people give up after experiencing a period in which their work environment is consistently a source of intense stress, or which yields negligible rewards.[11]
",These distinct types of burnout have been established as a prelude to the development of specific intervention strategies which can be employed in recovery from each kind of burnout.,Causes of burnout,"According to the doctors who classify burnout as a stand-alone medical condition, the key criterion for being diagnosed is simply that one’s daily occupation must be directly related to the deterioration of one’s mental and/or physical health. This can encompass one’s real or perceived inability to cope with the demands of the role itself, a problematic response to stressors associated with the work environment, or a combination of the two.","It is also possible for burnout to affect people who are experiencing a stressor in their personal life which is affecting their ability to perform their job, such as going through a breakup, caring for a family member with an illness, or coping with the loss of a loved one.",Traditional possible causes of burnout include one or more of the following factors:,"
Having a heavy workload: Jobs which require long hours can often inspire a feeling that one is working continually to finish an insurmountable workload. Particularly in professions where producing high-quality work is constantly required, such as being a lawyer, doctor or teacher, a constantly heavy workload can become overwhelming, leading to burnout.
Experiencing vicarious trauma: Working with people experiencing or processing traumatic events is an emotionally intense experience, which can inspire anxiety. Social workers, therapists and others who work in close contact with those experiencing stressors of a sensitive or triggering nature, are at risk of becoming emotionally affected by the ideas they encounter at work, and this may extend to feeling stressed, helpless, disturbed or unhappy outside of work hours. Periods of time spent processing emotions related to one’s job after hours constitute interruptions to one’s work/life balance.[12]People who encounter disturbing material as a result of their job, such as forensic analysts, are also at risk of experiencing vicarious trauma. Over time, living at this heightened pitch of emotion can lead to the feelings of distress and exhaustion associated with burnout.
Lacking autonomy: Administrative and service jobs are associated with long hours and hard work, but mostly involve following set processes, with no possibility for innovation on the part of the person performing the role. Environments where this is the case for most employees generally have low morale, overall. This is because working within a structured system over which one has no control, in order to perform duties that do not vary on a day-to-day basis, can become monotonous. Jobs of this nature are often associated with a lack of motivation and feelings of boredom and/or frustration.
Perceiving one’s work to be futile: The sensation that the duties one performs at work are failing to have the desired effect, can cause a person to develop burnout, particularly if this occurs for a prolonged period of time. Not being given credit for one’s achievements, having one’s suggestions ignored, experiencing continual interruptions throughout the working day or having one’s work discarded rather than incorporated into projects can all be factors which engender a sense of futility, ultimately causing burnout.
Not being sufficiently rewarded: It is widely accepted that one’s job will be more rewarding in some capacities than in others. For example, an accountant may not find their role emotionally rewarding, but would expect to be financially well-compensated for their efforts. In contrast, academics often accept that they will not earn a significant amount of money, but will expect their work to be intellectually stimulating and emotionally rewarding. Feeling that one’s job is insufficiently rewarding in any capacity, however, can be a significant causal factor in burnout.
Working in an unsupportive environment: This constitutes any kind of professional environment in which one feels either personally unhappy or unable to work effectively, or both. This can involve having unproductive or negative interpersonal dynamics with one’s colleagues, feeling the strain of working in a fast-paced environment without a culture of caring for one another, such as a financial trading floor, or trying to perform one’s role in an unsuitable or unstructured set-up where there are no protocols to follow when one encounters problems and/or needs guidance. These kinds of environments are also associated with having a poor work/life balance, another catalyst for becoming stressed, and eventually, burned out.Creative professionals, like artists and musicians and other kinds of freelancers who structure their own working environment, are also at risk of burnout. This is due to experiencing isolation resulting from the lack of a support structure that often typifies this way of working.
Experiencing unfairness or discrimination: Negative emotions and the increased stress associated with being treated unfairly by one’s coworkers and/or experiencing discrimination are both directly linked to burnout in many studies.[13][14][15]
Not sharing the values of one’s workplace or colleagues: Most people spend the majority of their time at work. When a person has different values to the coworkers that they are surrounded by throughout the working day, even if one does not experience outright discrimination, this can lead to feeling alienated, which can cause stress, and burnout.
",Diagnosis,"There are many different scoring systems available to doctors who wish to ascertain whether a person is suffering from burnout. Occupation-specific scoring systems are continually being devised, for example, a hassle-based diagnostic questionnaire was recently trialed, which is specifically designed to detect burnout that stems from the work-related stress experienced by call-centre staff.[16] The systems most commonly used to diagnose burnout and detect symptoms of job dissatisfaction are the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), the Job Diagnostic Scale (JDS) and the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES).",Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI),One of the most commonly used and well-established tests to define burnout in an individual is the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) scoring system.,The MBI Surveys comprise three general scoring scales:[17],"
Emotional exhaustion: Measures feelings of being acutely emotionally affected and drained of energy by the stress related to one’s work and/or working environment.
Depersonalization: Measures the extent to which one has ceased to empathise with one’s customers, clients, or the people in one’s care.
Personal accomplishment: Measures the extent to which one feels confident in performing one’s role, perceived productivity and the level of job satisfaction.
",The MBI has been adapted in order to assess burnout as it occurs in a variety of different industries.,Available versions of the MBI Survey include:[18],"
MBI-Human Services Survey (MBI-HSS): This questionnaire is designed to identify burnout in people working in professions which involve providing care, assistance or guidance to others, such as doctors, nurses, social workers, therapists, counselors, police, clergy and outreach workers. A specific version of the MBI-HSS has been adapted for medical personnel (MBI-HSS MP).
MBI-Educators Survey (MBI-ES): This version of the MBI is suitable for anyone working in an educational establishment, including administrators, headteachers, teachers and volunteers.
MBI-General Survey (MBI-GS): If one works in a profession which is neither related to human services nor education, the MBI-GS is the most appropriate version of the MBI to determine burnout. The MBI-GS will be offered to individuals working in jobs such as manufacturing, management, customer service or construction. A specific version of the MBI-GS has been adapted for adult students in college and university (MBI-GS-S).
","The MBI-GS measures different criteria for burnout in the specialized surveys, rating a person’s exhaustion, cynicism (indifference or frustration towards one’s work) and professional efficacy (an estimation of the likelihood that one will continue to be able to perform one’s role).",Job Diagnostic Scale (JDS),"Rather than evaluating a person’s experience of their work, the Job Diagnostic Scale (JDS) is used to examine the role itself, determining the likelihood that a given job will cause its employees to experience burnout. The JDS looks at both the tasks pertaining to a role and the overall work environment to determine the motivation potential of the role. Roles with a low motivation potential are more likely to engender burnout.[19]",Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES),Work engagement – identifying and feeling able to bring high levels of energy to one’s work – is seen as the opposite of experiencing burnout.[20] A person with a low score in the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES) can therefore be considered at high risk of experiencing burnout.,"The scoring system evaluates both a person’s personal resources, such as their self-esteem, belief in their ability to succeed and their capacity for optimism, and aspects of the work environment (such as the provision of performance feedback and supervisory coaching, and the extent to which the organisation makes its employees feel valued and able to work autonomously).[21]",Treatment,"There is no set treatment course for burnout. Many people find it helpful to leave their workplace either temporarily or permanently. However, others find it possible – through proactive decision making and/or with therapeutic support – to alter their work environment and their attitudes to it, in ways that remove or reduce the factors responsible for causing burnout.",Burnout FAQs,"Q: Is burnout different from depression?
A: Because the symptoms of burnout can be similar or identical to those of depression in some people, it is important not to diagnose or self-diagnose burnout too quickly. This may lead to a person, who is actually affected by depression, following a treatment plan solely geared to managing burnout rather than accessing the appropriate medical and/or therapeutic interventions for depression.[22][23]","Symptoms which are typical of both burnout and depression include reduced performance, low mood and exhaustion. However, in cases of depression, negative thoughts and feelings tend to be associated with many or all areas of a person’s life, whereas in cases of burnout they are typically solely related to one’s job and/or workplace. See these resources for more information about the signs of depression and experiencing a deptessive episode.","Q: If left untreated, what are the long-term health implications of burnout?
A: Chronic work-related stress can deplete a person’s physical health. Being stressed regularly not only causes emotional exhaustion but may cause gastrointestinal disorders,[24] and also place a strain on the heart. For this reason, burnout has been linked to several health conditions including systemic inflammation, impaired immunity functions and the development of cardiovascular disease.[25]"

,,,,,,,,,,What is dementia?,Dementia is not one specific condition; it is the name given to a broad set of symptoms that can be caused by a number of different disorders that affect the brain.[1],"People with dementia typically struggle with their daily lives and relationships as their mental functioning is impaired. They may be unable to control their emotions, and their personalities may change. They may also experience behavioral problems, like becoming agitated or delusional, or seeing things that are not there (hallucinations).[1]","Memory loss is common in dementia, but this symptom alone does not indicate that dementia is present. Dementia is diagnosed when two or more key mental functions are seriously impaired, without loss of consciousness. Examples of these functions include memory, language skills, visual perception and problem-solving skills.[2]",What are signs of dementia?,"Signs of dementia are the physical, mental or behavioral changes that occur in people experiencing dementia and that are detectable to others.","Signs of dementia vary from person to person, with factors such as an individual’s physical health, personality and social situation, among others, playing a role in determining how the syndrome presents itself.","Dementia is an umbrella term used to describe a variety of conditions affecting the brain, and there are broad similarities between the signs and symptoms of each condition. There are also, however, some condition-specific signs which should be noted.[3]",Early signs of dementia,"Dementia is a progressive condition, meaning that the signs and symptoms generally worsen over time. In some cases, the progression of dementia can be very slow, meaning the early signs can be difficult to spot.",Early signs may include:[4][5],"
Difficulty remembering recent events, but not those that occurred long ago
Forgetting the names of familiar people or common objects
Asking the same question or telling the same stories repeatedly

Getting lost in once-familiar surroundings
Difficulty thinking and reasoning
Neglect of personal care, such as forgetting to bathe or change one’s clothes
Sudden inexplicable changes in mood, such as feeling depressed, anxious or apathetic
","Dementia affects each individual differently, meaning that a person in the early stages of dementia may only display one or two of these signs. In its mild form, early-stage dementia is sometimes termed mild cognitive impairment (MCI). At this stage, the condition can often be difficult to diagnose accurately.[6]",Signs that suggest Alzheimer's disease,Alzheimer’s disease is the most common type of dementia.

Lack of social awareness (for example, making inappropriate comments or showing little tact)
Problems with language, such as finding the right words or understanding others
Obsessive behavior, such as compulsive eating or drinking
",Signs of later stage dementia,"The following are signs that dementia has progressed into its later stages. At this point, individuals experiencing the condition will become increasingly reliant on others and may require round-the-clock care.[8]","
Severe memory loss: An individual may be unable to recognize family, friends and even their own reflection. They may also struggle to recognize everyday objects and locations.
Communication problems: An individual may struggle to speak and understand others. In some cases, a person may say the same words or phrases repeatedly.
Loss of mobility: An individual may be unable to walk independently and may display uncoordinated or clumsy behavior.

Alzheimer’s disease
Vascular dementia
Dementia with Lewy bodies
Parkinson’s disease
Frontotemporal dementia
","In some cases, dementia can also be caused by repeated damage to the brain, something particularly common in people with alcoholism or those who have experienced chronic head trauma (boxers, for example).","Each variety of dementia has its own risk factors, though there are several that can apply to all. These risk factors include:","
Age: Dementia is relatively rare in people under 60 and common in people over 80. Age seems to be the biggest risk factor for the condition.
Family history: There is a genetic component to dementia, meaning those with a family history of the condition are more likely to develop it at some point in their lives. Generally, it is thought that the likelihood of this happening is higher if a close relative developed the condition earlier in life and less likely if it was later (over the age of 80).
Other factors: Smoking, high blood pressure and diabetes are thought to increase an individual’s chances of developing dementia. It is thought that lifestyle factors, such as mental and physical activity and social engagement,also play a role.
",Diagnosing dementia,"Diagnosing dementia typically involves a range of evaluations and tests. These are necessary to make sure no other conditions that may present similarly, such as depressive disorders, are being missed. The process will usually begin with an examination of the individual’s medical and family history and a full physical examination.[10][11]",Cognitive assessments,"If dementia is suspected, mental tests known as cognitive assessments will be carried out, usually by a doctor. These tests typically focus on evaluating memory, concentration, communication and awareness, among other factors. Although these tests cannot definitively diagnose dementia, they do play an important role in the wider assessment.",Blood tests,"A doctor will also typically carry out a blood test as part of the diagnostic process. The purpose of a blood test is to rule out other conditions that may be causing the symptoms or signs of dementia, like severe hypothyroidism. Again, a blood test cannot definitively diagnose dementia, but may help doctors to move closer to an accurate diagnosis.",Brain scans,"Brain scans may not always be carried out if doctors are confident in their diagnosis of dementia from other tests. If used, scans can be useful in helping doctors to identify the type of dementia being experienced, as well as to see if any other conditions, brain tumor or stroke, for example, may be causing the signs and symptoms.",Dementia treatment,"Treatment options for dementia generally depend on the type being experienced. There is currently, however, no cure for dementia and in most cases, treatment will focus on symptom management and making life as comfortable and meaningful as possible for the individual. This may involve the use of medications to temporarily improve certain symptoms, such as memory loss.[12]",Signs of dementia FAQs,"Q: Can dementia be prevented?
A: While it may not be possible to prevent dementia, it is thought that certain lifestyle factors could lower the risk of developing some types of the condition. These include:[13][14][15]","
Exercising regularly
Eating a healthy, balanced diet
Maintaining a healthy weight
Avoiding the use of tobacco products
Avoiding excess alcohol. This means drinking only occasionally and not exceeding recommended amounts, which in many countries is defined as at most 14 units of alcohol in one week. Some experts recommend half this for women. Several alcohol-free days should be included. One unit of alcohol is equal to roughly one small glass of beer or wine, or one “shot” of distilled spirits or liquor.[16][17][18]
Adhering to treatment programs for chronic conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart problems and depression
Keeping active, mentally and socially
Taking steps to avoid head trauma e.g. wearing a helmet when cycling
","Q: Is there a signs-of-dementia test?
A: There is no singular signs-of-dementia test. A person showing possible signs of dementia will need to be assessed by a medical practitioner. A doctor may ask the person to take a number of tests to check their mental functioning, i.e.cognitive assessments, in addition to ordering blood tests and other diagnostic tests.[11]","Q: What if a partner, relative or friend has signs of dementia?
A: It is advisable to encourage the person to see a doctor as soon as possible. If the signs of dementia are being caused by an underlying condition, e.g. hypothyroidism or depression, they should resolve with treatment. If it is dementia, an early diagnosis may, in some cases, allow the progress of the disease to be slowed. Early diagnosis also allows a person to access the medication and support they need. If the person does not wish to see a doctor about possible signs of dementia, they can be encouraged to go for a different reason, such as a physical check-up. It may be helpful to offer to accompany the person. If they cannot be persuaded to see a doctor, it may be useful to contact a local dementia support group or service.[19][20]"

This blockage creates a vacuum which allows bacteria to enter the middle ear.","In the case of outer ear infections, certain factors make the occurrence more likely. These include:[7]","
Substances in the ear: Water or other substances in the ear may create an environment where an accumulation of bacteria becomes more likely. This can cause infection. The subsequent itching after infection can cause skin irritation, which may make an infection worse. As otitis externa is common in people who swim regularly, the condition is sometimes referred to as swimmer’s ear.
Warm weather: The condition is more common in warmer countries.
Skin issues: Irritated skin, as a result of skin problems such as eczema, may make otitis externa more likely.
Otitis media: Ear discharge as a result of otitis media can sometimes become lodged in the ear and cause otitis externa.

In some cases, however, a ruptured eardrum may result in no symptoms at all. Upon examination, a doctor will be able to identify a ruptured eardrum and advise on appropriate treatment methods. Generally, a ruptured eardrum is considered non-serious and will in most instances heal naturally without the need for medication.[11]","Q: What is the Eustachian tube?
A: The Eustachian tube is a narrow canal that connects the middle ear to the throat (pharynx). Its main function is to ventilate the middle ear and to ensure that the air pressure in both sides of the eardrum remains equalized.[12] When the Eustachian tube becomes blocked as a result of an upper respiratory tract infection (such as a cold or the flu), this can create a vacuum in which bacteria can collect and enter the middle ear. This can cause a middle ear infection.","Q: Is earache always a sign of ear infection?
A: Although earache is a common symptom of ear infection (particularly middle ear infection), earache can also be connected to other conditions such as cold, flu, a buildup of earwax or teething in children.[13] Following an examination, a doctor will be able to identify the root cause of earache and outline treatment options.","Q: Are there any home remedies for an ear infection?
A: Ear infections will in most cases clear up naturally without treatment. However, there are a number of ways that the symptoms of an ear infection can be managed at home. Over-the-counter medications such as paracetamol and ibuprofen can be used to manage the pain associated with an ear infection, for example. A warm or cold compress may also be useful in managing pain, as can the application of warm oil (olive or vegetable) in cases where there is no perforation of the eardrum.[9]","Q: Should I be worried about an ear infection during pregnancy?
A: In the vast majority of cases, an ear infection during pregnancy poses no harm to your baby and – just as with an ear infection when you’re not pregnant – will normally remedy itself naturally. However, if the symptoms do not desist within two or three days it is a good idea to seek the advice of a medical professional.[14]","Q: What are the signs of an infection around an ear piercing?

Hemorrhoids can also make cleaning the anus after a bowel movement more difficult, and feces can remain on the bottom. Due to this, hemorrhoids may produce a bad smell.[4]
","Leaking feces and anal mucus can also irritate the anus. This can cause the anus to itch, a condition known as pruritus ani.[5]",Signs of internal hemorrhoids,"Internal hemorrhoids are the most common type of hemorrhoid. The swellings develop inside the anal canal. Small hemorrhoids stay inside the anal canal and cannot be seen or felt by the person who has them. Larger hemorrhoids may fall outside the anus in a process called prolapse, often during a bowel movement or while wiping. Hemorrhoids which prolapse may go back inside the anal canal on their own,or may be pushed back in by the person.","Internal hemorrhoids are graded according to their severity. To find out more, see the resource on hemorrhoids.",There is generally no pain associated with an internal hemorrhoid. Noticeable signs and symptoms of internal hemorrhoids include:[6][7],"

,,,,,,,,,,What are signs of herpes?
,,,,,,,,,,What are signs of herpes?,The signs of herpes are the observable manifestations of the herpes simplex virus.[1],"Herpes, also referred to as herpes simplex and HSV, is a viral infection caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV) and generally transmitted through interpersonal contact. There are two types of the herpes simplex virus: HSV-1 and HSV-2, both of which can cause oral and/or genital herpes.","Herpes is a common condition in both men and women and highly contagious. Although there is currently no way to cure the condition completely, it is possible to effectively manage the signs and symptoms.","
In oral herpes, most signs and symptoms present in and around the mouth.
In genital herpes, most signs and symptoms present around the genital region of both sexes.
","Herpes should generally be thought of as a non-serious condition, in which complications are rare.[2] If you are concerned that you may have herpes, try using the Ada app to find out what the problem is.",Signs of oral herpes,"The majority of people infected with oral herpes, or herpes labialis, will present no signs or symptoms and may thus be unaware of the condition. When oral herpes does present itself, the most common sign is the presence of blisters and ulcers in and around the mouth and lips – sometimes referred to as cold sores.","These ulcers will typically be red in color and sometimes bleed or weep puss; they may also be highly itchy and cause pain or discomfort. Although the mouth and lips are the most typical locations for ulcers to appear, they may also present themselves on the tongue, face or any other area of skin on the body.[3]","In babies and toddlers, a first infection may be symptomless. If symptoms are present, these usually include a high fever and painful, ulcerating blisters in the mouth and pharynx, i.e. the cavity behind the nose and mouth. In babies, herpes simplex infection is also called herpetic gingivostomatitis or aphthous stomatitis. Refusal to eat or drink may be a sign that a baby or toddler is experiencing the pain associated with the infection.","Babies and toddlers who are affected should be treated with local anaesthetic medications, i.e. creams and gels, rather than antiviral medications. Always consult a doctor and check the instructions on the packet to ensure that the type medication is suitable for a child and to find out the appropriate dose.","After the initial outbreak, the herpes infection may become dormant and lead to recurrent outbreaks later in life. If you are concerned that you may have oral herpes, try using the Ada app to find out what the problem is.",Signs of genital herpes,"Like oral herpes, the majority of people infected with genital herpes will be unaware of the condition. When signs and symptoms do appear, this can be weeks, months or years after the initial infection, though it is most common for them to appear after four to seven days.[4]",Primary infection,"When signs of genital herpes appear for the first time, they may include:","
Blisters around the genitals, rectum, thighs and buttocks. Commonly, these blisters will burst, becoming red and sometimes painful.
In women, blisters and ulcers may appear on the cervix
",Symptoms which may also be present include:,"
Pain when urinating
General illness, including aches, pains and flu-like symptoms
",Blisters and ulcers will typically last for up to 20 days.,Recurrent infection,"After the initial outbreak, the herpes simplex virus will remain dormant in the body. In some cases, no further outbreaks will occur, while in others, recurrent outbreaks are possible. Recurrent infections are generally less severe and last for a shorter period than the initial outbreak.",Signs of genital herpes in recurrent outbreaks include:,"
Small blisters around the genitals, rectum, thighs and buttocks
In women, blisters may also appear on the cervix
","People may also experience a sensation of burning or itching around the genital area or legs, often before blisters appear.","In rare cases, herpes labialis can also cause blisters or ulcers to appear in and around the mouth and face.","If you are concerned that you may have genital herpes, try using the Ada app to find out what the problem is.",Signs of herpes esophagitis (herpes in the throat),"The herpes simplex virus (HSV-1 or HSV-2) can also affect the throat, leading to a condition known as herpes esophagitis. In these cases, the condition will typically cause no outward signs but will lead to symptoms such as a sore throat, chest pain and irritation when swallowing.[5]","Herpes esophagitis can sometimes indicate that an individual has a weakened immune system, which may be caused by a serious condition such as diabetes, cancer or HIV. For this reason, it is important to consult a doctor if there is any suspicion of herpes in the throat.","If you are concerned that you may have herpes in the throat, try using the Ada app to find out what the problem is.",Signs of herpes simplex eye infection,"The herpes simplex virus (usually HSV-1) can, in some cases, spread to the eye, causing an eye infection. This will often occur when the virus reactivates itself after an initial infection, which may happen randomly or as a result of an illness, eye injury or stress, among other factors.[6]",Signs that the herpes simplex virus has spread to the eye include:,"
A red eye
Swelling around the eye
Watering of the eye
Pain in the eye
Sensitivity to light

However, in regard to genital herpes, the exact location in which blisters and ulcers appear can differ.","Both men and women may develop blisters and ulcers around the buttocks, thighs and anus. Men, however, may also develop symptoms on the penis or scrotum, while women may develop them on the vagina and vulva, as well as on the cervix, which is the lower section of the uterus (womb).[7] In rare cases, if an ulcer on the cervix becomes infected, this can cause cervicitis, a condition involving inflammation of the cervix.",Signs of maternal and neonatal herpes,"If a woman is infected with the HSV during pregnancy, it is possible for the virus to be passed on to the newborn baby, normally during delivery. Although this is rare, the resulting neonatal herpes can pose serious risks to newborns.","Signs that a pregnant woman is infected with the herpes simplex virus are the same as those in non-pregnant people. The risk of neonatal herpes is highest in cases where the pregnant woman develops herpes for the first time in the late stages of pregnancy, as the body is unlikely to have the necessary antibodies for combatting the virus. Women with HSV in a latent form, i.e.who have had the virus previously without recurrence, have a very low risk of passing the virus onto the newborn baby.[8]","Good to know: When acute/florid HSV infection is present around the time of the expected date of delivery, a Cesarean birth (C-section) will usually be recommended before the waters break to avoid the transmission of infection from mother to child.",Signs that a newborn baby has neonatal herpes include:[9],"
Lack of energy
Tiredness
Floppiness (limp limbs)
High temperature
High-pitched cry
Breathing difficulties or grunting
Rapid breathing

","If there is a suspicion of neonatal herpes, a doctor or midwife should be contacted as a matter of urgency. Treatment will typically involve the use of antiviral drugs administered intravenously over several weeks.",Causes of herpes,"Herpes is caused by the herpes simplex virus, which typically enters the body through the skin around the mouth, genitals and anus. It is also possible for the virus to be passed on through other areas of skin on the body as well as the eyes, though this is less common.[10]","Oral herpes is commonly passed on through activities such as kissing and sharing eating utensils, while genital herpes is typically transmitted through activities such as:","
Vaginal or anal sex; even with a condom, HSV can still be transmitted via skin-to-skin contact between a person with an active infection and others
Sharing sex toys
Close genital contact
",Diagnosing herpes,"Herpes will typically be diagnosed through a physical examination, where a doctor will check for the signs and symptoms of the condition. This will generally be enough to diagnose herpes, to confirm the presence of the condition, however, laboratory tests, including blood tests, can also be ordered.",Herpes treatment,"Treatment for herpes is aimed at managing the symptoms and controlling recurrent outbreaks. The most common treatment method is the use of antiviral creams and ointments, which will usually be applied at home. Antiviral drugs are also available to help manage herpes, though these are generally reserved for people experiencing recurrent outbreaks.[11]",When to see a doctor or visit a sexual health clinic,"Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted infection (STI), meaning that the most appropriate place to seek treatment may be a sexual health clinic. Most sexual health clinics operate a walk-in service, avoiding the need for an appointment. In most cases, oral herpes and the other forms of the condition are not STIs, meaning a general doctor’s surgery is the most appropriate place to seek treatment.",Seek treatment when any of the signs or symptoms of herpes appear.,"As genital herpes can take weeks, months or even years to present symptoms, it is important to be tested if you think you may have caught the infection and, if necessary, receive treatment – even if you have not recently been sexually active.",Herpes prevention,"To prevent spreading herpes to other people, care should be taken to avoid skin to skin contact during an outbreak of the condition. Activities such as kissing, sharing utensils and sexual activity should be particularly avoided.","Good to know: A condom does not offer effective protection against the transmission of HSV. Avoiding all sexual activity is recommended during an outbreak of herpes, because HSV can spread via any form of genital contact between a person with an active infection and others.",Signs of herpes FAQs,"Q: What are the signs of a herpes outbreak coming on?
A: People who experience recurrent outbreaks of genital herpes may come to recognize the early signs of a herpes outbreak coming on. These may include localized pain in the genital area and/or tingling and/or a shooting pain in the legs, buttocks or hips. Early signs and symptoms may present hours or days before the appearance of ulcers or blisters.[12]","Q: What are the early signs of mouth and lip herpes?
A: The early signs of mouth and lip herpes, otherwise known as oral herpes, typically manifest between 6 and 24 hours before the appearance of the first blister or ulcer. These early signs include tingling, pain and/or itching in and around the mouth or on the lips.[13]","Q: What are the signs of anal herpes?
A: Anal herpes is not a form of herpes in itself; the term refers to the development of signs of genital herpes in the anal area. The most typical sign of anal herpes is blisters or ulcers in or around the anus, which may become painful.[13]","Q: What are the signs of herpes on the tongue?
A: In some cases, oral herpes, or herpes labialis, can cause signs and symptoms to appear on the tongue. This will most likely be ulcers, which will typically be red in color and may cause some pain.","Q: What is the relationship between cold sores and herpes?
A: Cold sores are an alternative name for the blisters and ulcers experienced as a symptom of oral herpes. Cold sores, therefore, are caused by the HSV virus, most typically HSV-1, but in rare cases HSV-2, the virus responsible for genital herpes. Most people will first experience cold sores in childhood.[14]","Q: Can oral herpes become genital herpes?
A: Although it may be misleading to say that oral herpes can become genital herpes, it is the case that the virus that typically causes oral herpes, HSV-1, can also cause genital herpes, which is more usually caused by HSV-2. This means that a person with HSV-1 can cause genital herpes in another person through oral sex, even if they are not displaying symptoms of the condition."

,,,,,,,,,,What is a kidney problem?,"The kidneys form part of the urinary system, one of the body’s major filtration systems. Most people have two kidneys, situated in the upper abdominal area towards the muscles of the back and the edge of the ribs. The kidneys form part of the urinary system along with the two ureters, the bladder and urethra. Kidney problems affect the kidneys, but because the system works together, the effects of a kidney problem are sometimes felt throughout the system.","The kidneys themselves clean the blood by filtering it in the nephrons, which are made up of a renal tubule and a renal corpuscle. The corpuscle is made up of a glomerulus enclosed by the Bowman’s capsule. To filter the blood, it is passed through the glomeruli at higher pressure than the body’s usual blood pressure. Filtered waste products collect inside the Bowman’s capsule, while filtered, clean blood is passed back out of the glomeruli into the circulatory system. The tubule collects the waste products from the Bowman’s capsule while also working on further exchanging certain substances  and also reabsorbing water and certain minerals so they don’t go to waste. The final resulting liquid is then passed into the ureters as urine. Urine collects in the bladder, which stores it until it is released by the urethra.","Kidney problems in adults and teenagers are usually uncomfortable, but can typically be treated relatively easily by doctors. Kidney problems in pregnant women are of particular concern because of the effect they can have on both the pregnant woman and the baby. Diagnosing kidney problems in babies and toddlers can be difficult because their kidneys and bodies are relatively smaller and often cannot explain to their caregivers how they are feeling or where they are hurting.",General signs of kidney problems,"Although there are many types of kidney problems, most kidney infections, such as acute pyelonephritis, share common symptoms. These include:[1]","
Urinating frequently and/or urgently
Pain or burning while urinating
Pus in the urine
Cloudy or bad-smelling urine
Foamy, frothy or bubbly urine
Pink, red or brown urine
Fever
Chills
Nausea
Back pain, flank pain and/or groin pain
","Foamy urine is a sign of proteinuria, which is often also accompanied by swelling in the hands, feet, abdomen and/or face. Proteinuria is a symptom of nephrotic syndrome (see below).","Pink, red or brown urine is a sign of visible blood in the urine, known as gross hematuria, which is a symptom of nephritic syndrome (see below).

,,,,,,,,,,What are signs of low blood pressure?
,,,,,,,,,,What are signs of low blood pressure?,"Signs of low blood pressure are the observable manifestations of low blood pressure, also known by its medical name of hypotension.","Low blood pressure occurs when the force of blood pressing against the artery walls is lower than is usual. Blood pressure can vary throughout the day as a result of factors, such as temperature or simply standing up too quickly. Some people also have naturally low blood pressure.","In general, low blood pressure is only of medical concern if it is lower than what is normal for the individual, as this can restrict the amount of blood and oxygen flow to the body’s organs. Often, this will be linked to an underlying medical condition, such as heart disease.[1][2]",Signs of low blood pressure can include dizziness and fainting. Treatment will typically involve management of the underlying cause and may involve simple lifestyle changes.[1],"Types of low blood pressure: causes, signs & symptoms",There are several types of low blood pressure. Each is linked to a different cause and leads to different signs and symptoms. The four main types of low blood pressure are:,"
Chronic asymptomatic hypotension
Orthostatic hypotension
Neurally mediated hypotension
Severe hypotension linked to shock
",Chronic asymptomatic hypotension,People who have low blood pressure all the time have chronic asymptomatic hypotension. This type of low blood pressure is normal for them and will typically cause no signs or symptoms.[3],Orthostatic hypotension,"Orthostatic hypotension, or postural hypotension, occurs when a person stands up from a sitting or lying position too quickly.  This type of low blood pressure results from the body being unable to adjust its blood pressure fast enough after a change in position.",Signs and symptoms of orthostatic hypotension include:[4],"
Lightheadedness
Dizziness
Headache
Blurred vision
Fatigue
Nausea
Fainting
","Although it can occur in anyone, it is most common in older people. Orthostatic hypotension may also be a sign of an underlying medical condition, such as a cardiovascular disorder, anemia or dehydration. Certain types of medication, including diuretics, calcium channel blockers and nitrates, can also increase the risk of experiencing this types of low blood pressure.","Postprandial hypotension is a variant of orthostatic hypotension. This type of low blood pressure occurs following a meal. Again, older people are most at risk of postprandial hypotension, and it may be linked to conditions such as high blood pressure and Parkinson’s disease.[3]","People experiencing possible symptoms of any type of low blood pressure should see a doctor for evaluation. Additionally, the free Ada app can be used to carry out a symptom assessment.",Neurally mediated hypotension,"Neurally mediated hypotension (NMH) occurs after a person has been standing for an extended period of time. In rarer cases, NMH may occur during or following a frightening or unpleasant situation. This type of low blood pressure is caused by the brain and heart not communicating with each other properly.[3]",Typical signs and symptoms of NMH include:[3],"
Faintness
Dizziness
Nausea
",NMH is most common in children and young adults.,Severe hypotension linked to shock,Shock is a serious condition that occurs when blood pressure falls so low that the body’s organs receive too little blood to function properly.,"Shock can be caused by a variety of factors, including internal and external bleeding, severe infection, severe kidney disease and severe diarrhea.",Signs and symptoms of shock include:[5],"
Anxiety and confusion

","Good to know: Severe headaches, vision disturbances and pain can also be a sign of preeclampsia.",Low blood pressure diagnosis,"A diagnosis of low blood pressure will generally be given after a doctor has asked about the individuals symptoms, performed an examination and administered a blood pressure test.","Blood pressure test readings are given as two numbers, for example 150 over 80 mmHg (150/80). The first figure – the systolic level – shows the pressure inside the arteries as blood is pumped out of the heart. The second figure – the diastolic level – shows the lowest pressure inside the arteries between heartbeats. A reading of 90 over 60 mmHg (90/60) or less is generally regarded as indicating low blood pressure.[7]","A doctor may also perform a tilt test during diagnosis. During this test, the individual is positioned on a special table and slowly tilted upwards to allow the doctor to see how the motion affects blood pressure.",Low blood pressure treatment and prevention,"People with naturally low blood pressure and who experience no symptoms will require no treatment. However, people who have abnormally low blood pressure and who are experiencing symptoms will be advised by doctors to take a variety of simple steps to help manage the condition and prevent the onset of symptoms. In cases where these measures do not help, or when blood pressure is significantly low, medication may also be prescribed.",Actions that may help in preventing the symptoms of low blood pressure include:[1][8],"
Standing up or sitting down slowly
Crossing the legs, standing on the tip-toes or tensing the muscles while standing to promote blood flow
Avoiding triggers such as high temperatures or frightening situations
Raising the head slightly while sleeping
Wearing support stocking to help promote blood flow
Drinking plenty of fluids
Eating smaller meals
","In some cases, medication may be prescribed to help treat low blood pressure. The choice of medication will depend on the particular case but may include midodrine, fludrocortisone and droxidopa.[8]"
,,,,,,,,,,What is melanoma?
,,,,,,,,,,What is melanoma?,"Melanoma is one of the most aggressive forms of skin cancer. Other names for melanoma include malignant melanoma and cutaneous melanoma. The condition is primarily caused by prolonged, frequent or intense exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation,[1] from sunlight or artificial sources such as tanning beds.","Melanoma derives its name from the fact that it develops in skin cells called melanocytes. It is the only type of skin cancer which develops from melanocyte cells, which are one of the three main types of skin cells in the epidermis (the top layer of skin).[2] When functioning normally, melanocytes produce the pigment melanin, which protects the skin from burning and gives the skin and hair their coloring.","The production of melanin causes the changes in the skin that typically occur after exposure to sunlight, such as tanning, freckles and patches where the skin lightens and/or darkens unevenly. However, even if the changes to one’s skin appear healthy (such as a tan), exposure to UV radiation can cause melanoma to develop later on.","If melanoma is identified early, before it has had a chance to develop or spread to other areas of the body, it is likely that it can be easily and completely cured.[3] Doctors do not screen for melanoma routinely, so it is important for people to examine the entirety of their own skin regularly and to consult a medical professional at the first signs of a potential case. The Skin Cancer Foundation recommends performing a full-body self-examination once a month.",Symptoms,"Melanoma can develop anywhere on the body, including under the fingernails and toenails. The condition usually first appears on the skin, but can spread internally. Melanoma can usually be detected by monitoring changes to the skin, which often occur in areas that are frequently exposed to the sun such as the arms, legs, face and back.",The four main types of melanoma in skin are:[4],"Superficial spreading melanoma. This is the most common type of melanoma and involves melanoma cells spreading across the surface of the skin, most commonly affecting the skin on the chest, back and limbs.","Nodular melanoma. This is the second most common type of melanoma and can metastasize (spread) rapidly. It is most likely to be found on the chest, head, neck and/or back, and tends to redden, rather than darken, as it advances. Nodular melanoma develops when the cancer cells grow downwards into the skin in a vertical fashion, and will be characterised by a hard lump rising out of the skin where the nodule occurs.","Lentigo maligna melanoma. This is a slow-growing, rarer type of melanoma which most often affects older people who have spent long or intense periods of time exposed to UV radiation. It develops from a precancerous skin blemish called a lentigo maligna which looks like a liver-spot or stain.","Acral lentiginous melanoma. This is the rarest type of skin-based melanoma and is also described as hidden melanoma. It occurs in unexpected areas such as the palms of the hands, soles of the feet or the fingernail and toenail beds, and most commonly affects people with darker skin. It is not thought to be related to sun exposure.",People who may be experiencing possible signs of melanoma should consult a doctor. They can also take advantage of the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.,It is also possible for melanoma to develop without initially causing any changes to the skin. Forms of melanoma which do not usually first result in skin changes include:,"
Ocular melanoma (in the eyes)
Mucosal melanoma (in the nose, mouth, vaginal or anal passages)
Internal melanoma (where the cancer moves inside the body without first exhibiting any visual indicators on the skin)
",Signs of melanoma in moles,"The development of a new mole or a change to an existing mole are often the first signs of melanoma. It is important to avoid prolonged sun or other UV radiation exposure to reduce the risk of developing cancerous moles. Visit a dermatologist (skin doctor) immediately if there are any noticeable changes in a mole's color, height, size or shape. It is also vital to have one’s moles checked if they bleed, ooze, itch, appear scaly or become tender or painful.","Moles with three or more different shades of brown or black are particularly likely to be melanoma. If a mole suddenly begins to display any of the following signs, it is important to have it examined by a dermatologist to rule out the possibility of melanoma:[5]","
Asymmetry. One half appears different than the other half.
Border. The border or edges of the mole become ragged, blurred or irregular.
Color. Getting darker, becoming patchy or multi shaded; the color of the mole may have shades of tan, brown, black, blue, white or red.
Diameter. The mole may get bigger; enlargement of a mole is especially concerning if the diameter becomes larger than the eraser of a pencil.
Elevation/Evolution. Elevation means a mole which appears elevated or raised from the skin. Evolution means any change in size, shape or colour, or if a mole starts to look inflamed, bleed or become crusty.
","Good to know: The Melanoma Research Foundation recommends using the alphabetic mnemonic, ABCDE, as a way to remember these important signs that a mole could be cancerous.","In addition to an examination from a dermatologist, the free Ada app can also be used to carry out a symtom assessment.",Signs of melanoma in the skin,"It is possible to detect melanoma from changes in the skin which do not involve the development of new moles or changes to existing ones. The sudden appearance of a new growth in the skin is a common indicator of the presence of melanoma, particularly if it is pigmented or unusual-looking.",New growths on the skin which could indicate the presence of melanoma include:,"
Sores
Lumps
Nodules
Blemishes
Markings
","Changes to the way the skin looks or feels could also indicate the presence of melanoma. It is important to seek medical attention if an area of the skin looks or feels different from normal, as well as at the first appearance of any new growths.",Signs of ocular melanoma,Ocular melanoma is melanoma which affects the eyes. It most commonly occurs in the uvea (the layer of the eye beneath the white) and is often diagnosed by optometrists (eye doctors) during eye examinations. Signs of eye melanoma may include:,"
Visual field loss; losing part of one's usual range of vision
Blurred vision
Sudden loss of vision
A growing dark spot on the iris; the coloured part of the eye
Flashes of light
Floaters; spots or wiggly lines which drift into one’s field of vision
",Factors which make developing ocular melanoma more likely include:[6],"
Having blue or green eyes
Having pale skin
Being exposed to UV light intensively or for long periods of time
Ageing
Developing a mole in the eye or on the eye’s surface
Having dysplastic nevus syndrome
Having abnormal skin pigmentation
Increased pigmentation on the uvea
",Signs of mucosal melanoma,"Mucosal melanoma is a rare form of melanoma which can affect the mucosal areas of the body which line the respiratory, gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts.[7] Like the rest of the skin, the mucosa in these areas produces melanocytes and is therefore able to develop malignant melanoma.",Body parts which can be affected by mucosal melanoma include:[8],"
Nasal passages
Conjunctiva (lining of the eyelids)
Sinuses
Oral cavity
Esophagus
Gallbladder
Vagina
Urethra
Bowel
Anus
",Mucosal melanoma differs from other kinds of melanoma in that it is not thought to be causally related to UV radiation. There is a lack of knowledge about the early and specific signs of mucosal melanoma. The condition is often not diagnosed until it reaches an advanced stage in most cases.,Signs of mucosal melanoma include:,"
New or unexplained sores that do not heal
Persistent hemorrhoids
Pain during bowel movements
Bleeding from the rectum or vagina (in vulvar melanoma)
Spots or sores on the mouth or nasal passages
",Signs of internal melanoma,"Melanoma can metastasize (spread) from the skin to the internal organs, such as the liver.[9] However, the internal organs can develop melanoma without symptoms first being visible on the skin. When this happens, the condition is usually able to progress to an advanced stage before it is diagnosed. This is due to the fact that the symptoms of internal melanoma are non-specific, and could be caused by many other conditions.",Signs of unexplained illness which could indicate internal melanoma include:,"
Pain in the liver (right sided abdominal pain)
Headaches
Weight loss
Fatigue
Swollen lymph nodes
",Signs of hidden melanoma,Hidden melanomas are so-called because they develop in places which are often overlooked when checking one’s body for signs of skin cancer. Areas of the body which may be affected by hidden melanoma include:,"
Genitals
Fingernails and toenails
Scalp
Soles of the feet
Palms of the hands
",Signs of hidden melanoma may include:,"
Changes to a mole in the relevant area
Redness or swelling beyond the border of a mole
The spread of pigmentation, particularly if this occurs from a new spot
Changes in sensation, such as itchiness, tenderness or pain when touched
Sores that do not heal
","Acral-lentiginous melanoma is when the condition affects the toenails, fingernails, palms of the hands or soles of the feet. This form of the condition is often difficult to diagnose, as the first signs can be very subtle. The first sign of acral-lentiginous melanoma is often a patch of brown or grey discolouration on the skin.[10] Due to the fact that the feet are not often checked for melanoma and elderly people often find the soles of the feet difficult to see, this type of melanoma is most often diagnosed by podiatrists (doctors specialising in conditions related to the feet).[10]",Signs of melanoma FAQs,"Q: What are the signs of melanoma in children?
A: In children, the blemishes that indicate melanoma are often different to the signs of melanoma in adults, for example they are often paler in colour . Yellow, white or pink sores or bumps on the skin that bleed, itch or do not heal are the most common sign of melanoma in children. Melanoma in children is rare, affecting only around 300 children per year on average in the U.S.[11] As with adults, children with fair skin and red or blonde hair are at greater risk of developing melanoma than children with darker complexions.","Q: Why does having fair skin increase the likelihood of developing melanoma?
A: Melanoma affects people of all skin types. However, fair-skinned people have a significantly greater risk of developing melanoma than people with darker skin. This is because their skin produces smaller quantities of melanin than darker, more pigmented skins. In the absence of sufficient quantities of melanin, the skin is less able to withstand damage from UV radiation.[12] Those with the palest complexions are at greater risk of developing melanoma than people who tan easily or are olive skinned.","Is it possible to prevent the spread of melanoma?
A: Once melanoma is present, It is not possible to prevent it spreading without beginning medical treatment. However, one can take precautions to prevent the condition developing in the first place, such as staying out of direct sunlight and wearing sunscreen..","The earlier melanoma is suspected, diagnosed and treated, the greater the chance of removing the melanoma in its entirety before it has had a chance to spread. For this reason, it is important to check one’s whole body regularly (most doctors recommend on a monthly basis) for the development of abnormal skin features such as enlarged moles or growths. Consulting a doctor about suspected melanoma is the best means of intercepting this kind of skin cancer before it begins to spread, so that the process of diagnosis and treatment can begin as early as possible.",Read more about Melanoma »
,,,,,,,,,,What are the signs of miscarriage?
,,,,,,,,,,What are the signs of miscarriage?,"The main signs of miscarriage, or that a person is about to miscarry, are pain and cramps in the pelvic area, and vaginal bleeding, which intensify as the miscarriage progresses. In many pregnancies, miscarriages take place without the affected person perceiving any signs that they are going to miscarry: often, miscarriages are diagnosed during a routine ultrasound scan.","At the first signs of miscarriage, immediate medical attention should be sought. The doctor or midwife will be able to find out if the affected person is about to miscarry, or, if a miscarriage is already taking place, and can provide any treatment needed. It may be necessary to run diagnostic tests to see if a miscarriage is occurring, such as checking for levels of the pregnancy hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in the blood and/or urine, and an ultrasound scan to detect the baby’s heartbeat.","Although they are possible signs of miscarriage, vaginal bleeding and abdominal cramps are not always a cause for concern, as, in many cases, they can also be present due to processes that the body goes through during a healthy pregnancy. If a pregnant person’s symptoms do not indicate a miscarriage, the check-up will be an opportunity for the doctor or midwife to identify any other possible complications with the pregnancy and/or to offer them reassurance that the baby is developing normally.","Read more about Pregnancy »
Read more about Pregnancy Complications »",Good to know: Miscarriages which occur in the first trimester (weeks 1-12 of pregnancy) are known as early miscarriages. Miscarriages which occur in the second trimester (weeks 13-20 of the pregnancy) are known as a late miscarriages. Loss of the baby which occurs after week 20 of pregnancy is known as a stillbirth.[1],Symptoms of miscarriage,"When present, common signs of a miscarriage, or that a person is about to miscarry, include:[2]","
Abdominal cramps
Abdominal pain
Vaginal bleeding
Discharge of fluid or tissue from the vagina
Loss of the common early signs of pregnancy, such as nausea and breast tenderness
","It is normal for the symptoms of early pregnancy, including nausea or sickness, vomiting and implantation bleeding, to ease off towards the end of the first trimester, as most bodies adjust to their pregnancies. However, a sudden loss of pregnancy symptoms, which had previously been pronounced, may indicate a miscarriage. The Ada app can help you check symptoms you may be concerned about. Download the free app or find out more about how it works.",Differences between early and late miscarriage symptoms,"Although the signs of a miscarriage ‒ including blood or spotting (small amounts of blood coming from the vagina), discharge and abdominal pain ‒ are broadly the same whether the miscarriage is early or late, there are some differences in their specific characteristics.",Late miscarriages often involve:[3][4],A greater volume of vaginal discharge and bleeding,"A person is more likely to see blood clots in their discharge in a late, rather than early, miscarriage. These are likely to be larger and thicker than those passed in the first trimester. Blood or spotting during the second trimester is more likely to be related to a miscarriage; small amounts of blood leaving the vagina is common in the first trimester and can be unrelated to miscarriage.",More severe abdominal pain,"Cramping and abdominal pain are commonly present in miscarriages. However, the severity of the pain and cramps is greater in a late miscarriage and is unlikely to respond to traditional pain-relieving techniques such as taking a hot bath, lying in certain positions or taking over-the-counter pain-relief medications suitable for pregnant people.",More severe back pain,"Back pain can occur in both early and late miscarriage. It is possible to experience back pain throughout pregnancy without it relating to a miscarriage, as it is a normal side-effect of carrying a growing fetus in the womb. However, intense pain in the lower back is commonly a feature of late miscarriage. It results from the muscles in the lower back working to expel the unborn baby.",Loss of fetal movement,"In many pregnancies, the movements of the developing fetus can be felt from around week 16 of pregnancy; for first-time mothers, fetal movement may be felt later than this, at around week 18-20. The unborn baby’s decreased or absent movement may indicate miscarriage. However, it can also indicate other possible problems with the pregnancy and does not necessarily mean that the fetus has died. If the fetus is moving less than normal, or appears to have stopped moving altogether, prompt medical investigation will be necessary to diagnose miscarriage or other possible problems.","After week 12 of pregnancy, the presence of symptoms like blood or bloody discharge coming from the vagina, abdominal pain or back pain is more likely to indicate a miscarriage than to relate to other factors associated with a healthy pregnancy. Medical attention should be sought promptly if these symptoms occur, especially if they are present after week 12 of pregnancy.","Bleeding from the vagina in combination with abdominal pain and/or cramps is more likely to be indicative of a miscarriage than the presence of any of these symptoms on their own. Many people become concerned that they are having a miscarriage, if any of its possible symptoms occur ‒ particularly the presence of blood ‒ so it is advisable to seek medical attention to check if there is a problem.",Other possible explanations for signs that could indicate miscarriage,"A person who is miscarrying may experience some, all, or none of the common signs of miscarriage. However, their presence is not always a sign that a miscarriage is taking place.",Other causes for the symptoms of miscarriage include:[5],"
Implantation. Light bleeding or spotting is commonly experienced by pregnant people around the time the fertilized egg implants in the uterus.
Light vaginal bleeding, due to early pregnancy. Aside from implantation bleeding, spotting is also commonly present at intervals during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. This does not always mean that one is having an early miscarriage.
Blood flow to the pelvic area in pregnancy. Many people produce a greater quantity of discharge than usual during pregnancy as more blood flows to the pelvic area.
Normal pain and cramps associated with pregnancy. Pain and cramps are features expected of a healthy pregnancy, to some extent. It is common to experience stomach aches and constipation, which may cause pain, especially back pain, and cramps. These symptoms of pregnancy will often worsen as the fetus develops.
","Rather than meaning that a person is miscarrying, the loss of pregnancy symptoms could mean that their body is adapting well to the pregnancy. Many people experience bodily changes indicating their pregnancies, such as nausea, vomiting and breast tenderness. However, these generally lessen or become absent as most pregnancies progress ‒ particularly after the first 12 weeks ‒ and so experiencing a loss of pregnancy symptoms is not always a sign of miscarriage or a cause for concern.","Other complications of pregnancy, which may also produce some of the symptoms associated with miscarriage, include:[2]","
Ectopic pregnancy. This occurs when the embryo attaches outside the uterus (womb), for example in one of the fallopian tubes; a common subtype known as a tube pregnancy. As with a miscarriage, abdominal pain and bleeding or spotting are two principal signs of ectopic pregnancy.
Molar pregnancy. This occurs when a lump of abnormal cells grows in the womb, instead of a healthy embryo. As with miscarriage, vaginal bleeding can be a sign of molar pregnancy.

This can put their mind at ease and/or detect any complications with the pregnancy. It is always worth consulting a medical professional if a person is worried about any potential problems with their pregnancy; a medical professional is unlikely to turn a person away if they perceive any cause for concern.,Types of miscarriage and their symptoms,"It is possible to have a miscarriage without being aware of or experiencing any related symptoms such as bleeding, cramping or pain. Types of miscarriage in which symptoms may not be discernible by the pregnant person include:[6][7]",Missed miscarriage,"Many miscarriages are diagnosed during a routine scan in the course of a pregnancy apparently progressing normally, due to detecting the absence of a fetal heartbeat.  Before the scan, one possible warning sign of a missed miscarriage may be that the unborn baby or bump is smaller than it should be at this stage. No pregnancy tissue or fetal matter will pass out of the womb in a case of missed miscarriage, and the physical miscarriage may have to be medically induced.",Chemical pregnancy,"Many miscarriages take place because the fertilized egg fails to fully and properly implant in the uterine lining. These miscarriages often occur before people are necessarily aware of their pregnancies. In miscarriages related to chemical pregnancy, the lost fertilized egg and pregnancy tissue may be mistaken for a person’s next menstrual period, and they may therefore be unaware of miscarrying.","A miscarriage can be complete or incomplete, depending on whether all or part of the fetus and pregnancy tissue passes out of the body after the miscarriage begins:[6]",Complete miscarriage,"The entirety of the fetal matter and pregnancy tissue pass out of the uterus naturally and rapidly through the cervix, the lowest part of the womb, connecting it to the vagina, after the miscarriage begins. Pain, bleeding and cramping will typically be experienced as the fetus and pregnancy tissue are passed. There is usually no need for further medical treatment, and doctors will advise on appropriate aftercare and possible psychological interventions to help a person process the experience of miscarrying.",Incomplete miscarriage,"Only part of the fetal matter and pregnancy tissue exit the womb. Pain, bleeding and cramping will typically be experienced as this is passed. Further medical treatment will be needed to identify the extent of the remaining tissue and to remove it.",Signs of miscarriage in diagnostic tests,A pregnant person should seek medical attention at the first sign(s) of a suspected miscarriage. The diagnostic tests to confirm a miscarriage and possible treatment options will depend on the type of miscarriage a person is having.,"Early miscarriages are most commonly diagnosed using a combination of tests, including:[8][9][10]",Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test,To test for the presence of the pregnancy hormone in the blood and/or urine. Doctors will look out for low or diminishing levels of hCG compared to the levels of hCG expected for the person’s stage in pregnancy.,Pelvic exam,"Doctors will examine whether the cervix is dilated and check for the presence of blood and/or pregnancy tissue in the cervical opening, both signs that can indicate miscarriage.",Ultrasound scan,"This is a non-invasive, safe imaging technique which uses soundwaves to create images of the developing fetus and pregnancy sac. During a scan, doctors will look out for signs of miscarriage including an empty pregnancy sac in the uterus, pregnancy tissue but no fetus in the uterus, and/or a fetus or embryo which is smaller than it should be by this stage of pregnancy. If the pregnancy is far enough advanced for the scan to detect the unborn baby’s heartbeat - after week seven of pregnancy - then doctors will also look out for the lack of a heartbeat.",Fetal heart scanning,This is a special type of scan which produces detailed images of the unborn baby’s heart. The absence of the baby’s heartbeat is a conclusive sign of miscarriage.,Diagnosing late miscarriage,"In a late miscarriage there may be no need for these tests to confirm the diagnosis, but any or all of them will be performed if necessary. However, the miscarriage may be conclusively evidenced by symptoms including:","
Abdominal pain
Bleeding / spotting
Passing a recognisable pregnancy sac or tissue
Delivering the fetus

Doctors will usually recommend or prescribe appropriate over-the-counter or prescription painkillers to help manage the pain and cramping. For people who have a complete miscarriage, where all pregnancy tissue and fetal matter pass out of the uterus naturally, no further medical treatment is typically needed, but psychological treatments such as counselling may be necessary to help a person process the experience.[2]","For people having an incomplete miscarriage, there are a range of possible treatment options including:[11][12][13][14]",Medically-induced miscarriage,"This is a non-surgical treatment which involves taking a medication called misoprostol(Cytotec) in order to induce cramping in the uterus, which pushes out the remaining fetal matter and pregnancy tissue over the course of approximately 4-5 hours. One advantage of a medically-induced miscarriage is that the medication can be taken at home.",Manual vacuum aspiration,This procedure is usually recommended for early miscarriages or as a means of removing any remaining pregnancy tissue when the fetus has already passed out of the womb. A device is inserted into the cervix to empty the womb of the fetus and all pregnancy tissue using gentle suction. This procedure can be carried out under local anesthetic and takes around 10-15 minutes.,Surgery,"There are two possible operations for surgically inducing miscarriage, both of which are usually performed under general anaesthetic as outpatient procedures.",Dilation and curettage (D&C),D&C is usually performed in early miscarriages and involves using an instrument called a curette to scrape the pregnancy tissue and fetal matter out of the dilated uterus.,Dilation and extraction (D&E),D&E is usually performed in late miscarriages and involves using a grasping instrument called forceps to take the fetus out of the dilated uterus.,After a miscarriage,"After a medically- or surgically-induced miscarriage, cramps and bleeding or spotting may continue for up to two weeks, and a person should avoid sexual activity until their next menstrual period at around 4-6 weeks after the miscarriage completes, in order to reduce the risk of infection. Absorbent products, such as sanitary pads, will be needed to manage spotting for 2-3 weeks after treatment; a person’s doctor or midwife will be able to make appropriate recommendations.","Post-miscarriage psychological intervention such as one-on-one or group counseling may be recommended to help a person process the experience, and to avoid developing anxiety and depression in the aftermath of miscarriage. Doctors will be able to recommend a range of available support options.",Read about post-miscarriage psyhcological intervention »,FAQs,"Q: What are the signs that an infection is causing a miscarriage?
A: Most early miscarriages are the result of problems with the placenta or chromosomal abnormalities of the fetus, rather than infections affecting the pregnant person. Late miscarriages are most likely to be caused by an underlying health condition, including an infection caused by bacteria such as chlamydia or salmonella.","If a pregnant person is affected by an infection, this can spread to the site around the unborn baby and cause the neck of the womb (cervix) to open too soon, resulting in miscarriage. There is usually no pain or bleeding when an infection causes miscarriage. The waters breaking is very likely to be the first sign of miscarriage caused by infection.","Q: Is diarrhea a sign of miscarriage?
A: Diarrhea is not necessarily a sign that something is wrong with a pregnancy, and pregnant people may experience it over the course of a normal pregnancy for a variety of reasons, including adapting to a healthy pregnancy diet. However, diarrhea is sometimes indicative of food poisoning like salmonella, toxoplasmosis or listeriosis, all of which are associated with an increased risk of miscarriage.

,,,,,,,,,,What is postpartum depression?
,,,,,,,,,,What is postpartum depression?,"Also known as postnatal depression, postpartum depression (PPD) is a type of depression that can occur after having a child. PPD is much more than the mild “baby blues” that many new mothers experience for a few days or a couple of weeks after giving birth to their child. Postpartum depression is a serious medical condition that can interfere with a parent’s ability to care for themself and their baby, and often requires treatment by a doctor.[1][2][3][4][5]","Depression after the birth of a child is relatively common, and is thought to affect approximately one in every 10 women. However, it may be difficult to recognize. Signs and symptoms of postpartum depression may go unnoticed or be mistaken for other conditions, or may be hidden out of a fear of being judged or stigmatized for not being a good, happy parent.[6][2][3][5]","Postpartum depression can also affect the partners of women who have recently given birth, as well as people who have recently adopted a child. It can affect any new parent.[1][3]","Postpartum depression may occur together with a number of other conditions, e.g. an anxiety or depressive disorder, diabetes or thyroiditis. The relationship between depression and other conditions is complex.[7]","Though it is not classified as postpartum depression, many women may also experience intense emotional distress, depression and/or anxiety after a miscarriage.[8]",What are the signs of postpartum depression?,"Signs of postpartum depression are generally present for more than two weeks. A parent with postnatal depression will often start to experience symptoms within the first month of having a child, but they can develop any time in the first 12 months, or even during the pregnancy itself.","While they may vary from person to person, as well as differ in form and severity, some of the more common signs and symptoms of postnatal depression, like other types of depression, include:[6][2][3][4][9][10]","
Persistent low mood; this may take the form of sadness, hopelessness, emptiness, irritability, frustration, anger, a feeling of being overwhelmed, or other negative emotions
Loss of interest or pleasure in activities that used to be enjoyable, including sex
Strong feelings of guilt or worthlessness
Tiredness and lack of energy and motivation
Trouble concentrating and making decisions
Memory problems
Overwhelming worry or anxiety
Restlessness or trouble sitting still
Withdrawal from loved ones
Disrupted sleep patterns, including difficulty falling asleep or sleeping too much
Changes in appetite
Persistent headaches, other pains, or digestive trouble without a clear physical trigger
","It is important to keep in mind that some of the symptoms listed above, e.g. tiredness, disrupted sleep patterns and low sex drive, are normal after having a baby – and not necessarily indicators of PPD.","A parent with postpartum depression may also experience recurrent thoughts of harming their baby, as well as recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. In severe cases, there may be suicide attempts. If a person shows signs of crisis – obvious indicators that they are strongly affected by depression or at risk of suicide – it is important to call a doctor, emergency services provider or suicide prevention line without delay.","For more information on the diagnosis and treatment of depression, see our general resource on depression.",Risk factors for postpartum depression,"It is not known exactly what causes PPD. Some articles suggest that postpartum depression may be caused by hormonal changes after birth, but there is not sufficient  evidence to support this idea. The strongest risk factors for developing postpartum depression are thought to include:[6][2][3][4]","
A personal or family history of mental health conditions, e.g. depression or bipolar disorder
Lack of social support, i.e. friends and family
A poor relationship with one’s partner
Significant stress or major life events, e.g. death of a loved one or a move, during or after the pregnancy

A: Postpartum depression is a type of depression that occurs in new parents, within 12 months of having a child.[12]","Q: What if my partner, relative or friend has signs of postpartum depression?
A: It is important to broach the subject very carefully and tactfully, and encourage the person to talk about how they are feeling. Listening without judgment may be helpful, and, if it seems appropriate, the person could be encouraged to speak to their GP or another medical practitioner. In addition, they could be encouraged to take small steps to help themselves, such as taking breaks and eating a balanced diet. It is important to be reassuring and patient with the person at all times.[13] If a person shows signs of crisis – obvious indicators that they are strongly affected by depression or at risk of suicide – it is important to call a doctor, emergency services provider or suicide prevention line without delay."
,,,,,,,,,,What is shingles?
,,,,,,,,,,What is shingles?,"Shingles is an infection that usually produces a painful skin rash, but the painful tingling sensations which characterize the condition can also occur when no rash is present. Shingles is caused by the varicella zoster virus (VZV).[1]","VZV is the same virus that causes chickenpox, a very common childhood infection.[2] After a person has had chickenpox, VZV remains dormant in their body for the rest of their lifetime. If the virus reactivates, which can happen decades later, most often due to a weakened immune system, the resulting condition is called shingles. Although anybody who has already had chickenpox can develop shingles, the condition most commonly affects adults, typically those over 60 years of age.","The early signs of shingles are typically sensations of itching, numbness or a burning pain on the skin of the face, chest or back; in most cases this develops into the condition’s characteristic rash.","The rash develops into blisters on one side of the body, most commonly in one the following areas:","
Neck
Torso
Face
","A shingles outbreak typically lasts for three to four weeks.[3] Many people experience only one outbreak of shingles in their lifetime, although the condition can recur.","Good to know: Shingles is also known as herpes zoster, but it is important to note that this condition is not caused by the same virus, called herpes simplex, that results in genital or oral herpes.","Read more about Genital Herpes »
Read more about Herpes Labialis »",Symptoms of shingles,The principal symptom of shingles is a painful skin rash. This looks like red or discolored skin at first and eventually features weeping blisters.,Signs of shingles before the rash appears,"Before the rash appears, early warning signs of shingles, which may be present, include:","
Itching, burning pain, numbness, tingling in the place where the rash will develop
Flu-like symptoms such as chills, fever, headache, feeling fatigued or overly tired
Upset stomach
","After the initial skin complaints develop into the shingles rash, the condition typically lasts for two to four weeks. The pain typically worsens as the rash develops and alleviates as it heals.",What does the shingles rash look like?,"The varicella zoster virus which causes shingles lies dormant in the nervous system, so the rash will appear in a dermatomal pattern; a band or area of skin on the body corresponding to a particular set of nerves.[4] The shingles rash usually appears on the face, neck or one side of the torso.","Good to know: If the relevant nerves are affected, it is also possible to experience shingles on the leg. It is relatively unusual, but also possible, to develop the shingles rash in more than one area of the body, i.e. in relation to more than one set of nerves. Even more rarely and especially in people with a compromised immune system, three or more dermatomes may be affected. This is a form of the condition known as disseminated zoster.","As the condition progresses, the rash site develops blisters which fill with clear fluid. Because shingles interacts with a person’s nervous system, the rash is often accompanied by an intense, stabbing pain which worsens as it develops. The area affected by the rash may be hypersensitive to touch, which can render it difficult to dress or to sleep in certain positions.","A person with shingles is contagious to others in the period when their rash is blistering. During this period, a person should avoid physical contact with others, in particular, certain population groups, including:","
Elderly people
Pregnant people
People with a weakened immune system
People who have not had chickenpox in the past
","The blistering phase of the rash usually lasts for seven to ten days, and the lesions should then reduce in size as they heal, eventually disappearing.",Subtypes of shingles,"Although the painful shingles rash on one side of the face, neck or torso is present in most cases of shingles, the condition can take various other forms.",Less common forms of shingles include:,"
Zoster sine herpete; shingles with pronounced pain, but without the rash
Internal shingles; shingles affecting the internal organs
Herpes zoster ophthalmicus; shingles affecting the nerve in the eye
Herpes zoster oticus; shingles which invades the facial nerve
",Zoster sine herpete (ZSH): shingles without the rash,"It is possible for a person to develop shingles without being affected by the rash, although this is rare. When shingles occurs without the rash being present, this is called zoster sine herpete (ZSH).","When shingles occurs without a rash, the first symptoms of the condition may involve:","
A feeling of numbness in a certain area
An itchy, burning sensation
A painful sensation
Headache
Fatigue
Generalized aches
Hypersensitivity to touch
","When shingles is present, even without the rash, sensations will be concentrated in a specific area of the body – commonly the face, neck, one side of the torso or the eyes. However, in the absence of the shingles rash, zoster sine herpete may still rarely lead toneurological and visceral diseases, such as inflammation of the brain (encephalitis), Varizella pneumonia, paralysis of the facial nerves and problems related to keeping one’s balance or problems with hearing.[5]","Because shingles shares characteristics with many other conditions, including herpes simplex, impetigo, dermatitis herpetiformis and contact dermatitis, it can easily be confused with these conditions. In cases where a rash is not present, a laboratory test will usually be necessary to establish the presence of the varicella zoster virus in the body.[6]",Internal shingles,"In rare cases, shingles can invade the lungs, nervous system and brain instead of – or as well as – the external areas of the body. This is more likely to happen in cases where a person has a weakened immune system, for example as caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or by undergoing a course of chemotherapy.","It is rarely possible to have internal shingles without a rash if it only affects internal parts of the body. People, who have a weakened immune system and suspect they may have shingles even though the typical rash is not present, should make their healthcare professional aware of their medical history immediately in order to prevent shingles developing internally.","Symptoms of internal shingles are related to the affected internal organ. If a person has internal shingles affecting the lungs, for example, developing pneumonia is a possible symptom.[7]",Herpes zoster ophthalmicus,"Also called ophthalmic herpes zoster, this form of the condition involves shingles invading the nerve in the eye. The first indicator that shingles has spread to the eye is the development of the shingles rash and/or associated sensations in the tip of the nose.[8]","If shingles is suspected in the nasal area, it is advisable to consult an ophthalmologist, a doctor specializing in conditions which affect the eyes, without delay, as this form of shingles can cause visual distortions and even blindness.","Good to know: In some cases of herpes zoster ophthalmicus, Hutchinson’s sign may be present. This involves vesicles (fluid-filled sacs) developing on the tip or side of the nose, due to shingles affecting the nasociliary branch of the trigeminal nerve, which is connected to parts of the nose as well as the cornea in the eye.",Herpes zoster oticus (HZO),"This type of shingles occurs when shingles affects the facial nerves. Symptoms may vary, depending on which of the cranial nerves in the head is affected. The cranial nerve VII (nervus facialis) is affected in around 90 percent of cases of herpes zoster oticus, resulting in shingles on the face, neck, ear and/or mouth.","The other, less common, forms of herpes zoster oticus are:","
Ramsay Hunt Syndrome; a peripheral facial palsy, characterized by acute pain in one ear and the face. Vesicles may be present in the external ear canal, as well as additional auditory symptoms in some cases.
HZO affecting cranial nerve VIII; or nervus vestibulocochlearis, which produces vestibular (balance system) symptoms such as dizziness and vertigo in addition to the shingles rash.
","If a person suspects they may be affected by herpes zoster oticus, they should consult a healthcare professional immediately, as shingles which affects the facial nerves, indicates a likelihood of developing internal shingles.",Causes of shingles,"All people who have been affected by chickenpox and, rarely, people who have been vaccinated against chickenpox and thereby carry VZV ‒ the virus which causes herpes zoster/shingles ‒ in their body, are at risk of developing shingles.","Good to know: If a person who has been vaccinated against chickenpox develops shingles, the infection tends to be significantly less severe than the condition can be when it affects people who do not carry any form of VZV in their body. It is therefore, in general, worthwhile for a person, who has not experienced chickenpox, to be vaccinated against it, even though this is an attenuated vaccine (containing a weakened version of the virus that does not cause the illness), and therefore does not offer total protection against related conditions such as shingles.","Shingles will affect around one in three people in the U.S. during their lifetime. After a person has recovered from chickenpox, VZV remains dormant in their body. It is stored in the nervous system and can reactivate as shingles when a person’s immune system is compromised by aging, illness or stress.",Is shingles (herpes zoster) contagious?,"Shingles is only contagious at the point when the rash is blistering. At this time, VZV can be passed from a person with shingles to others via direct bodily contact, passing on traces of infected blister fluids and the sharing of towels, bedding and utensils.","It is only possible to catch the varicella zoster virus, rather than shingles itself: If a person who has never had chickenpox before is infected with VZV by somebody with shingles, they will develop chickenpox ‒ the first infection which VZV causes when it enters the body ‒ as opposed to shingles.[9]",Risk factors,"Shingles is most common in adults over 60 years of age. The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that all people over 60 be vaccinated against shingles. The vaccine reduces the overall risk of contracting the condition by around 50 percent, and lessens the duration and severity of shingles if it occurs.[10]","Shingles can also affect people whose immune systems have been weakened by injury or illnesses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), cancer or the use of certain medicines or treatments which place a lot of stress on the immune system – such as organ transplants and chemotherapy. People of any age, who have previously had chickenpox and are experiencing a prolonged period of severe stress, are also at risk of shingles.",Pregnant people,"If a person develops shingles while pregnant, it is usually mild and poses no further risk to the individual or their unborn baby.[11] However, pregnant people who have never had chickenpox, should avoid contact with those affected by chickenpox and those affected by shingles as a precautionary measure.","People with shingles or chickenpox both have the capacity to infect others with VZV, and developing chickenpox whilst pregnant can result in potentially severe health complications for both the pregnant person and the developing fetus.",Diagnosis,"Because the shingles rash is instantly identifiable due to its dermatomal pattern, the rash and accompanying pain, usually on one side of the body, are generally the only symptoms which need to be present for a shingles diagnosis to be made. The doctor will usually perform a physical examination and may take a swab from a blister, sending a sample of cells from the aggravated area of skin for a laboratory test in order to confirm the diagnosis.","It is recommended that anyone who thinks that they may be developing shingles seek medical attention as soon as possible to get supportive treatment and decrease the chance of infecting others. Although it is not possible to cure shingles, various pharmaceutical products can be prescribed on diagnosis which can help ease the pain and lessen the duration of the condition. These work most effectively when taken as soon as possible after the onset of shingles. If you suspect that you could be experiencing the first signs of shingles, or are unsure, consult the Ada app for a free symptom assessment.",Treatment,"There is no cure for shingles, but by diagnosing the condition early, it is possible to:","
Prevent the spread and severity of shingles
Reduce associated health complications
Ease the pain
Lessen the duration of the outbreak
","Following a diagnosis of shingles, a physician will generally advise on a recovery plan designed to alleviate the discomfort associated with the shingles rash.",Recovery plan,Activities which are usually recommended for a swift recovery from shingles may include:,"
Resting and relaxing
Wearing loose-fitting clothes
Keeping the rash clean and dry in order to dry out the blisters
Keeping the rash uncovered so that the blisters can progress into the scabbing stage as quickly as possible
Using cool compresses to alleviate the burning sensation on the skin
Avoiding sharing bedding, clothing or towels, as this can facilitate the spread of infection to others
",Medications to aid recovery,Medications which may be prescribed for alleviating the physical discomfort of shingles and combating the flare-up of the varicella zoster virus may include:[12],"
Painkilling medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), paracetamol or opioids in cases of severe pain. In some cases, antidepressants or anticonvulsants may be prescribed for their pain-relieving properties, which can work effectively in combination with other painkillers.
Antiviral medications
",Signs of shingles FAQs,"Q: Are there further health risks associated with shingles?
A: If left untreated, shingles is more likely to result in post herpetic neuralgia (PHN), a condition in which a burning pain continues to be felt in the areas affected by shingles for more than three months[13] after the rash and blisters themselves have disappeared. Approximately one fifth of people who are affected by shingles will go on to develop PHN.[13] The likelihood of shingles spreading to internal regions of the body likewise increases in the absence of a promptly initiated treatment and recovery plan.","Q: Are the signs of shingles different in adults to those in children?
A: The signs of shingles in children are largely the same as the signs of shingles in adults. However, shingles in children is generally less severe and lasts for a shorter duration than in adults, and most children recover well with no associated health complications. Shingles rarely affects children under three years of age and can only affect children who have already had chickenpox.[14] Shingles are not common in children.[15] However, having a weakened immune system as a result of an autoimmune disease, other chronic or serious disease or because of being overly stressed, however, can increase the likelihood of a child developing shingles.[16]","Does stress cause shingles?
A: Stress itself does not cause shingles. However, it can, in some cases, make an attack of shingles more likely.[16] This is because stress may weaken the immune system, potentially leaving a person more vulnerable to all types of infection, including the varicella zoster virus.[17]","Good to know: People who have a weakened immune system, and who have never been infected by VZV before, will develop chickenpox the first time they catch the virus, rather than its subsequent form, shingles.","Q: Can herpes zoster cause encephalitis?
A: This rare condition occurs when the brain becomes inflamed, which is usually caused by the spread of an infection in the body to the brain. Viral infections, including the herpes simplex virus causing oral and genital herpes and VZV, which causes shingles, are more associated with developing encephalitis than bacterial infections. The possibility of developing encephalitis due to the spread of VZV or another virus is greater in people with a weakened immune system; for example, if a person’s immune system is compromised due to another underlying health condition, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).[18]","Early signs of encephalitis include flu-like symptoms such as headaches, fever, aching muscles and nausea,[18]. More serious symptoms include drowsiness, seizures and difficulty speaking.[19] Immediate medical attention should be sought if encephalitis is suspected, as it can be life-threatening and should be treated as soon as possible. Diagnostic tests for encephalitis will involve an MRI or CT scan of the head to visualize the extent of the inflammation and a lumbar puncture to determine its cause. This will allow doctors to decide on the best course of treatment. If encephalitis is caused by the herpes simplex of VZV virus, treatment will involve a course of antiviral medication.[20]","Q: What are the signs of shingles healing?
A: Normally, the blisters that feature in the shingles rash will burst around five days after they first develop. At this point, the stages of shingles healing are as follows: they will weep, turn into crusty scabs and begin to heal thereafter. From the time they burst, the scabbing and healing process takes approximately two weeks. Signs that shingles is healing as normal during this time include the size of the scabs diminishing, and, correspondingly, the severity of the pain associated with the rash reducing.[21]","Q: Should I get the shingles vaccine?
A: The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention recommend the shingles vaccine for all people over 60 years of age, whether they have had chickenpox or not. The vaccine reduces the overall risk of contracting the condition by around 50 percent, and lessens the duration and severity of shingles if it occurs.[22]","The shingles vaccine is not recommended for certain population groups, including people who are:[22]","
Pregnant. A person who has had the shingles vaccine should wait a minimum of four weeks before trying to become pregnant
Affected by a condition which weakens the immune system, such as HIV
Affected by any type of cancer affecting bone marrow or the lymphatic system
Using immunosuppressive medications such as steroids
Undergoing radiation therapy or chemotherapy
Receiving an organ or bone marrow transplant in less than 4 weeks time, just having received it or while being on immunosuppressive medication after receiving one[23]

,,,,,,,,,,What is concussion?
,,,,,,,,,,What is concussion?,Concussion is a condition that occurs as a result of a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). It involves the short suspension of the brain’s normal function as it responds to the impact of an injury to the head – such as a knock or fall.,"Concussion can result from any injury in which the brain is jolted from its usual position to the extent that it hits the inner wall of the skull. This trauma can stretch or damage brain cells.[1] This means that, after trauma, it becomes increasingly likely that the normal movements of the brain inside the skull, which would normally not cause any damage to the brain, could go on to result in bruising and bleeding.","It is sometimes possible to see the outward signs of concussion, such as dizziness, nausea or confusion. In the immediate aftermath of the causal injury, concussion itself is initially a microscopic injury to the brain which will not be visually evident if the brain is scanned, e.g. by doing a CT scan of the head. For this reason, many cases of concussion go unnoticed or undiagnosed.","People do not always exhibit or notice the physical or behavioral symptoms of concussion, so it is important to look out for signs of concussion in all cases where a person has sustained an injury to the head. Although people experiencing concussion may display perceptible symptoms such as nausea, headaches and slurred speech, these may only begin to occur several hours or days after the injury itself.","It is important to see a doctor following any injury to the head in order to assess the likelihood of concussion and devise a recovery plan.[2] Recovery techniques will focus on resting sufficiently and avoiding strenuous physical and mental activity, so as to allow the brain to recuperate, thereby limiting the likelihood of any possible concussion developing into a long-term condition.",Signs of concussion in adults and teenagers,"Concussion can cause a person to experience a temporary loss of consciousness, lasting for seconds, or minutes. Not everybody who experiences concussion loses consciousness, but, in cases where loss of consciousness does occur, the longer a person who has sustained a head injury remains unconscious, the more severe their concussion is likely to be.[3] Medical attention should be sought in all cases where an injury to the head has resulted in loss of consciousness.","In addition to a possible loss of consciousness, a person with concussion may experience one or more of the symptoms from this checklist:[4]","
Feeling confused
Feeling as though one is in a blur or fog
Forgetfulness, often extending to the circumstances which caused the concussion
Headache
Feeling pressure in the head
Ringing in the ears
Seeing stars
Slurred speech
Nausea
Dizziness
","Many people recover from concussion unaided, without necessarily noticing that they have experienced the condition. However, it is possible to develop post-concussion syndrome, where the symptoms of concussion persist for weeks, months or years after the injury took place. To ensure a full recovery from concussion and prevent this outcome with appropriate aftercare, it is important to look out for signs of concussion in anybody who has experienced a head injury.",Read more about concussion »,How long after a head injury do signs of concussion appear?,"It is very common for additional symptoms of concussion to appear in the hours or days after the causal injury. The time it takes for the signs of concussion to be present after a head injury varies considerably between people. One may be able to see some symptoms, such as a temporary loss of consciousness, in the immediate time period after the primary injury. Further signs of concussion, such as nausea or dizziness, can begin to appear within minutes, or can be delayed, or go unnoticed, for hours or days after the causal injury.",Symptoms of concussion which may appear later on include:[5],"
Irritable mood and changes in personality
Sensitivity to light, noise and other external stimuli
Reduced ability to concentrate
Poor memory
Difficulty sleeping
Changes to the senses of taste and smell
Depression

Monitor kids who have sustained a head injury for the signs of concussion associated with their age group and seek medical attention in all cases of suspected concussion.[6],Signs of concussion in babies,Signs of concussion in babies may include:,"
A bump or bruise to the head
Changed sleeping habits; sleeping more or less can both be indicators of concussion
Crying when the head is moved
Vomiting
Changes in mood, especially increased irritability
Difficulty feeding

Behavioral changes
Loss of interest in their usual activities
Sleeping more or less
Excessive crying
Headache
",Signs of concussion in children (aged two and above),"Children aged two and above tend to display more behavioral changes related to concussion, similar to those experienced by adults.",Signs of concussion in children may include:,"

",Causes of concussion,"Concussion is the most common kind of mild traumatic brain injury. It occurs as the result of a knock or jolt to the head, which causes the brain to move from its normal position inside the skull, damaging the cells in the affected area. Activities which may result in head injuries, such as driving motor vehicles and playing sports, increase one’s chances of experiencing concussion. Knocking one’s head as a result of falling over can also result in concussion and is a principal cause of concussion in infants and the elderly.",The leading causes of concussion recorded by emergency departments are:[2],"
Falling
Injuries related to motor vehicles
Accidentally being struck by or against an object
Assaults
Playing sports
","According to the Journal of Athletic Training, approximately 300, 000 sport-related traumatic brain injuries occur in the United States annually, of which the majority are concussions. Motor vehicle crashes are the second most common cause of traumatic brain injury among people aged 15 to 24 years, and the most common cause of concussion across all age groups.[3]",When to seek medical attention after a head injury,"Many people make a rapid and full recovery from concussion. Nevertheless, it is important to consult a doctor in all cases where the condition is suspected. Failing to rest and recuperate adequately when one has concussion can lead to the development of post-concussion syndrome, where the signs of concussion persist for weeks or months after the initial injury.",Seek immediate medical attention in all cases where:,"
A person of any age is feeling or behaving differently after sustaining an injury to the head, even if only one or two of the signs of concussion are apparent
A child has experienced any kind of head injury that is more significant than a slight bump to the head,[7] i.e. any injury which causes bruising or bleeding or causes the child to indicate that they are experiencing pain
",There is usually no need to seek medical attention for suspected concussion after a minor head injury if a person of any age:,"
Remains alert
Has not been unconscious for any amount of time
Responds normally to speech
Is not dizzy, nauseous, or displaying any other age-appropriate indicators of concussion
",Concussion danger signs,"A person affected by concussion involving a temporary loss of consciousness and/or a period of post-traumatic amnesia will need immediate medical attention in order to establish the impact of their traumatic brain injury (TBI) on their brain, and to devise a recovery plan.","Returning to day-to-day activities, especially playing sports, while suffering from an initial concussion can worsen its physiological and psychological impact, and can also increase the risk of incurring a second concussion or developing post-concussion syndrome.[8]","Emergency care should be sought after a head injury if a person of any age presents with any of the concussion danger signs, which include:[9][10]","
Losing consciousness for more than 30 seconds[11]
Having headaches repeatedly, or which worsen over time
Visible and persistent bumps, bruising or swelling anywhere on the head, particularly in children and infants
Nausea and vomiting getting worse instead of better
Becoming increasingly irritable over a number of days following the injury
Stumbling or being clumsy
Feeling disorientated, confused or experiencing difficulty recognizing familiar concepts
Slurred or altered speech
Seizures
Distorted vision and blurriness
Dilated pupils or pupils of different sizes
",Additional concussion danger signs in babies and toddlers may include:[10],"
Refusing to nurse or eat
Inconsolable crying
","If any of the concussion danger signs are present, seek immediate medical attention. Any of these symptoms may indicate that the kind of head injury sustained is more serious than a concussion. For example, in rare cases, a collection of blood, called a hermatota, can form inside the head following a blow or bump, squeezing the brain against the skull.[10]",Concussion FAQs,"Q: Is it safe for someone to fall asleep if they have signs of concussion?
A: Yes. It is a myth that it is dangerous to fall asleep following a concussion. It was once believed that falling asleep after becoming concussed could result in slipping into a coma, but this idea has been discredited by medical research.[12]","In fact, getting plenty of rest is of principal importance in recovering from concussion and allowing the trauma to the brain to heal. Consulting a doctor, followed by sleeping and/or resting is the best course of action for anyone affected by concussion, unless the doctor has advised that the concussed person needs to undergo further treatment related to the TBI.","Q: Is it possible to tell whether a person has a mild or a severe concussion?
A: Symptoms such as loss of consciousness, slurred or altered speech, or confusion, persistent nausea and vomiting in the immediate aftermath of a concussion, may be signs that a person has been severely concussed, or has another, more serious form of head injury.","In diagnosing concussion, doctors once used grading systems to establish whether a person’s condition was slight or severe, particularly in sports medicine. The grading system would typically be used with the end goal of determining how much recovery time an injured player would need before returning to play.","The use of grading systems is now less common, but a popular and scientifically proven means of assessing concussion is the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). The GCS is a practical test for assessing how greatly a person’s consciousness is impaired. It can be used for all patients that have any kind of impairment of consciousness, including concussion. It is routinely used to screen a person’s neurological state if any kind of trauma to the head is suspected, for example, after an accident.","The GCS can help monitor the course of a person’s symptoms over time and can help doctors in selecting appropriate treatment for a person to make a full recovery, for example, whether they will need emergency care or a breathing tube (intubation). As standard practice, doctors will evaluate concussion and advise on a recovery program on a case-by-case basis, taking all of a person’s symptoms and case-history into account.","Q: What changes to the pupils in the eyes could be signs of a concussion?
A: Dilated pupils or pupils of unequal sizes could indicate that a person is affected by a severe concussion or a more serious form of TBI than concussion. However, this only applies if the difference in size between the pupils is greater than one millimeter. Differences in size between pupils of between half a millimeter and one millimeter are completely normal and quite common.","Concussion and other forms of TBI can prevent the eyes from focussing easily on relevant objects, and/or working as a pair. To identify this, eye movement tracking tests are sometimes performed in the diagnosis of a concussion. These are activities, such as watching moving objects on a screen, which test the reflexes of the pupils.[13]","Q: How long do the signs of concussion last?
A: In most people, perceptible symptoms of concussion resolve within around two weeks. A recent study on the effect of cognitive activity level on the duration of post-concussion symptoms has revealed that the more one rests one’s brain ‒ including refraining from activities such as using computers and smartphones ‒ during the period after concussion, the more quickly normal brain function will be restored.","When post-concussion syndrome is not present, full recovery from concussion ‒ including the physical recovery of the brain from the injury, which will be imperceptible to the affected person ‒ can take as long as up to 100 days. The time it takes to recover from concussion can be significantly reduced, to around 20 or 30 days, by ensuring that one refrains from returning to one’s normal day-to-day activities and rests appropriately.[14]","How long should I look out for the signs of concussion after a head injury?
A: In some, cases, signs of concussion may appear in the immediate aftermath of a concussion. For other people, signs of concussion may not appear straight away, and may develop in the days or weeks following the primary injury. It is therefore important to be aware that any symptoms experienced later on may be signs of concussion, and to have them investigated by a doctor.","Q: What is post-concussion syndrome (PCS)?
A: Post-concussion syndrome (PCS) is a rare condition in which people continue to experience symptoms related to their concussion for weeks, months or even years, if left untreated after the injury that led to their concussion. These may include sleeping problems, difficulty remembering things, fatigue, dizziness, headaches, depression and sensitivity to noise and light. Treatment will involve addressing the specific symptoms that each person with PCS experiences. With appropriate medical supervision, PCS relieves over time in most cases.",Read more about Post-concussion Syndrome »,"Q: What can a person do to facilitate effective recovery from concussion?
A: The most important element of recovering from concussion is allowing the brain to rest, both through getting sufficient sleep and ensuring that one takes a break from one’s normal working or school hours and from sporting activities.","Returning to work or school before the brain has recovered to the point where symptoms are no longer present can increase the chances of prolonging the concussion. If the symptoms of concussion return, this may be an indicator that one has rushed the recovery process and returned to one’s usual routine too soon. Medical attention should then be sought and a revised recovery plan devised.[15]"
,,,,,,,,,,What is small cell lung cancer?
,,,,,,,,,,What is small cell lung cancer?,"Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a type of lung cancer. Almost all cases of SCLC are caused by smoking. It is mostly centrally located in lungs and grows very rapidly and aggressively, which means it can spread quickly to distant sites. Typical symptoms include coughing, chest pain, shortness of breath and weight loss. SCLC can be diagnosed after carrying out blood tests and scans of the lungs and testing a small sample of lung tissue. Treatment depends on the stage of the cancer. Not all cases can be cured, as the cancer has often already spread by the time of diagnosis.",Risks,"Cancer occurs when abnormal cells grow uncontrollably. These cells destroy the normal cells around them, and can spread into other areas of the body. There are two broad types of lung cancer, small cell and non-small cell lung cancer. Small cell lung cancer is the less common type. SCLC mostly affects smokers. Non-smokers are rarely affected. This tumor is slightly more common in men than women and is usually diagnosed in people between the ages of 60 and 80.",Symptoms,"The typical symptoms are a cough with bloody phlegm, chest pain, shortness of breath and weight loss. Wheezing and a loss of appetite are also common. If the tumor has spread, symptoms may include headache which is at its most acute in the morning, blurred vision, light sensitivity, nausea, vomiting, confusion, bone pain and difficulty swallowing.",Diagnosis,"For people who smoke and display the symptoms of SCLC, a suspected diagnosis is commonly made. A physical examination is then carried out involving blood tests, a chest x-ray, a phlegm test and lung function tests. A small piece of the lung tissue is taken (a biopsy) and investigated to confirm the diagnosis. Further biopsies and scans may be done to see if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. This process is called staging and is important, as the therapy and outlook depend on the stage of the disease.",Treatment,"The treatment of small cell lung cancer depends on the size of the cancer and whether the cancer has spread. These combination of these factors decides the stage of the cancer. Depending on the stage, SCLC can be treated by radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery, or a combination of these. The treating doctor can give the best advice about appropriate treatment. People who have SCLC may benefit from taking part in a support group or counseling program, especially whilst undergoing their treatment.",Prevention,Quitting or totally avoiding smoking is the best way to prevent SCLC.
,,,,,,,,,,What is smoke inhalation?
,,,,,,,,,,What is smoke inhalation?,"Smoke inhalation occurs when a person breathes in smoke from burning material or gases during a fire. Smoke inhalation is a leading cause of mortality due to fire, causing approximately 5000 to 10,000 deaths per year in the USA alone.[1]","Smoke contains a mixture of harmful chemicals and irritants, though the exact composition depends on factors such as what is being burned, the temperature of the fire and the amount of oxygen feeding the fire. Inhaling smoke can cause the airways and lungs to become irritated, swollen and blocked, and may prevent oxygen from entering the bloodstream. If this happens, respiratory failure can occur.[2] Smoke inhalation requires immediate treatment to prevent complications.",The damage to the body inflicted as a consequence of smoke inhalation is often referred to as smoke inhalation injury.,Causes of smoke inhalation,"Smoke inhalation generally occurs when an individual is trapped within an enclosed space during a fire. In most cases, it causes damage through asphyxiation (lack of oxygen) and irritation of the lungs and airways.[3]",Asphyxiation,"Fire can use up a significant amount of oxygen from the air, leaving less available to breathe. When this happens, asphyxiation can result. The presence of carbon monoxide in the smoke can make this particularly pronounced, as carbon monoxide takes up far more room than oxygen. Carbon monoxide is contained within carbon-containing fuels such as gas, wood, coal and oil.","Oxygen combines with the hemoglobin inside red blood cells to create oxyhemoglobin. As the red blood cells circulate around the body, oxyhemoglobin provides the body’s tissues with the oxygen they need to survive.","Carbon monoxide can also bind with hemoglobin to create carboxyhemoglobin. As smoke containing carbon monoxide is inhaled, carboxyhemoglobin begins to circulate around the body, causing the tissues to become increasingly starved of oxygen. As carbon monoxide binds roughly 200 times more tightly to hemoglobin than oxygen, this can happen even if there is only a small amount of carbon monoxide present.[3]",Irritation of the lungs and airways,"A fire can create smoke containing a variety of chemical irritants and particles, i.e. unburned or partially burned materials small enough to enter the body, with the potential to cause significant damage to the lungs and airways. Such irritants include sulfur dioxide, ammonia, hydrogen chloride and chlorine. Breathing in these irritants and particles can cause blockage of the airways, inflammation and respiratory failure.",Symptoms of smoke inhalation,"The symptoms of smoke inhalation will depend on what exactly has been inhaled (the composition of the smoke), and the duration of smoke inhalation. General symptoms, however, include:[2][4]","
Coughing and hoarseness
Irritated sinuses
Shortness of breath, which may lead to total respiratory failure
Chest pain
Headache
Stinging eyes or vision problems
Runny nose
Loss of consciousness
Cardiovascular abnormalities, including cardiac arrest
",Symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning,"If carbon monoxide is contained within the smoke, carbon monoxide poisoning may result. Symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning typically differ depending on the length of time an individual is exposed and how much carbon dioxide is present. They may include:[5]","
A tension-type headache
Dizziness
Nausea and vomiting
Convulsions
Increased heart rate
Stomach pain
Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
Respiratory arrest
Soot in the nostrils and/or throat
",Smoke inhalation diagnosis,"Diagnosing smoke inhalation injury will typically first involve a doctor determining the source of the smoke, how long the individual was exposed to the smoke and the medical history of the individual. After this, a number of tests can be used to investigate the severity of the damage done by smoke inhalation. Due to the need for immediate treatment of smoke inhalation, diagnostic tests will usually take place after initial treatment has been given.",Tests used to determine the severity of smoke inhalation-related injuries include:[2][6],"
Blood gas test: Used to measure the amount of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the blood, allowing doctors to determine how well the lungs are functioning. Also called an arterial blood gas test if the blood sample is taken from the wrist.[7]
Blood tests: A sample of blood will be taken and tested in a laboratory for information about the functioning of the body.
Chest X-ray: Used to look for signs of damage to the lungs and for signs of infection.
Bronchoscopy: A bronchoscope (tube with a light and camera attached) will be passed through the throat and into the airways to allow doctors to check for damage.
Pulmonary function tests: A variety of different tests used to measure air flow and lung size, as well as how well oxygen and other gases enter and exit the blood.[8]
Lung VQ scan: An imaging test used to measure air flow in the lungs. Also known as a lung and pulmonary ventilation and perfusion scan.[9]
",Smoke inhalation treatment,"The person experiencing smoke inhalation should be removed from the scene and taken to a location with fresh air as soon as possible.[3] This will usually be the responsibility of firefighters. Following this, oxygen at a high flow rate should be administered via a facemask. This will help to quickly increase the amount of oxygen dissolved into the bloodstream and prevent asphyxiation.","Once the individual has been removed from the scene and taken to a hospital, a number of treatment methods may be used. These include:[1][3][6][10]","
Bronchoscopy: A bronchoscopy is used for both diagnostic and treatment purposes. Using a bronchoscope, a tube mounted with a light and camera, doctors are able to identify and remove particles and secretions lodged in the airways and lungs. Pain relievers or sedatives may be administered to the individual before the procedure takes place.
Hyperbaric oxygenation: If the individual has been exposed to high levels of carbon monoxide, hyperbaric oxygenation may be used. This involves the individual being exposed to increasingly high levels of oxygen over a period of 60 to 90 minutes from within a specially designed chamber. This will help to increase the level of oxygen in the blood.
Medications: Various medications, including antidotes, antibiotics to help prevent infection, steroids to open the airways and medications used to manage pain, swelling and fever may also be administered.
",Smoke inhalation risks and complications,"The inhalation of smoke can cause serious short and long-term health problems and should be considered a serious injury. The lungs may become infected, swollen or fluid-filled, something that can cause respiratory failure. This can lead to severe heart and brain problems and be potentially life-threatening. In the USA, smoke inhalation is the leading cause of death for victims of fire.[11]",Smoke inhalation prevention,"The prevention of smoke inhalation generally involves the prevention of fire. Each year in the USA, the highest percentage of fires occur in residential properties and over half of these are cooking-related.[12]","Smoke alarms are critical to the early detection of a fire and should be fitted in every home, workplace and public building on each floor. Fire alarms should be tested regularly to ensure that they work as intended.","All buildings should also have an established escape plan for use in the event of fire. This should be reviewed periodically, memorized by the inhabitants or frequent users and practiced regularly.","Other fire prevention methods include ensuring that all burning materials – such as cigarettes, candles, stoves and fireplaces – are carefully monitored at all times and thoroughly extinguished after use. Heating systems should also be checked by a professional regularly and fixed if necessary.","It may also be useful to make a habit of unplugging all electrical appliances after use and ensuring there is no build-up of lint in the home’s dryer. It is also important to ensure all flammable or combustible materials, such as lighters, matches and oils, are kept out of the reach of children at all times.",Other names for smoke inhalation,"

,,,,,,,,,,What is stomach cancer?
,,,,,,,,,,What is stomach cancer?,"Stomach cancer, sometimes called gastric cancer, is a slowly progressing cancer that arises from the stomach. Symptoms of stomach cancer are abdominal fullness, dark stools, nausea, vomiting, and unexplained weight loss, although many people will have no symptoms in the early stages. Men over the age 40, people who have an infection of the stomach by the Helicobacter pylori bacteria, or who have inflammation of the stomach over a long period of time tend to have a higher risk of getting stomach cancer. Stomach cancer is most commonly treated with a combination of surgery, chemotherapy and, sometimes, radiotherapy. Stomach cancer is often diagnosed when it is already in an advanced stage, and this can be difficult to treat. People who are diagnosed early have a better chance of recovery.",Risks,"Stomach cancer is an uncommon condition. Cancer occurs when a group of abnormal cells grows uncontrollably. These cells can destroy the normal, healthy cells around them, and can spread into other areas of the body. An important risk factor for the development of stomach cancer is infection with Helicobacter pylori (a bacteria). This bacteria can cause stomach ulcers which, over time, can develop into cancer. Smoking and excessive alcohol intake increase the risk for gastric cancer significantly. Some foods may increase the risk of this condition, and these include smoked foods, salt-rich foods, red meat and pickled vegetables when eaten in large amounts. Some causes of stomach cancers seem to run in families, so having a family member who has had stomach cancer may increase the risk of developing this condition.",Symptoms,"People with stomach cancer often have no symptoms in the early stages of the condition. Some people experience abdominal pain, heartburn, a loss of appetite or a feeling of becoming quickly full when eating. As the condition progresses, people may feel weak and tired, and may develop abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, black stools and unexplained weight loss.",Diagnosis,"Diagnosis is usually made based on the symptoms, and by carrying out a physical examination and endoscopy, a process which involves inserting a camera through the mouth to look at the stomach. A sample of the stomach ulcer or growth (a biopsy) is taken to investigate for cancer. A CT scan (computed tomography scan) may be done to look at the size of the cancer and for any evidence of spread beyond the stomach.",Treatment,"Treatment of stomach cancer depends on the size of the cancer, the exact type of cancer and whether the cancer has spread beyond the stomach. These combination of these factors decides the stage of the cancer. Depending on the stage, stomach cancer can be treated by surgical removal of part of or the whole stomach, by radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or a combination of these therapies. The treating doctor can give the best advice as to treatment.",Prevention,"Stomach ulcers should be treated and followed up with an endoscopy. Giving up smoking and reducing alcohol intake may also help to reduce the risk of stomach cancer. Eating a diet low in meat, and with plenty of vegetables, unsaturated fats and whole grains (a Mediterranean diet) may reduce the risk of stomach cancer.",Other names for stomach cancer,"

,,,,,,,,,,What is a subarachnoid hemorrhage?,"Subarachnoid hemorrhage is a condition where there is bleeding in the head. The bleeding occurs in a space between the layers of tissues that cover the brain, in an area called the subarachnoid space. It is commonly due to a burst blood vessel in the brain, due to weakness of the vessel walls or a malformation. The most common symptom is a sudden, severe headache, often with nausea and vomiting. The diagnosis is confirmed either by doing a scan of the head or by taking a sample of the fluid from around the spinal cord and testing it for the presence of blood. Treatment depends upon the severity and may include emergency life-saving measures, surgical repair of the bleed and medications to reduce the risk of complications. The outlook after a subarachnoid hemorrhage depends on the size and severity of the bleed.",Risks,"Subarachnoid bleeding is bleeding in the head which occurs in subarachnoid space (the space between the layers of tissues that cover the brain). This can cause pressure on the brain, and problems supplying the brain with blood. Causes include a burst blood vessel in the head (a ruptured aneurysm) and diseases which cause blood vessel damage, such as vasculitis or blood vessel malformations. Smoking and high blood pressure may also increase the risk of this condition. This condition is not common. It tends to be more common in middle-aged adults, although it can affect people of any age.",Symptoms,"The most common symptom is a sudden, severe headache which is often described as 'the worst headache ever' or as if there had been a blow to the head. Other symptoms may include nausea and vomiting, dizziness, a stiff neck, blurred vision, eyes which are sensitive to light, drowsiness, a loss of consciousness and seizures.",Diagnosis,"The diagnosis may be suspected based on the symptoms and a physical exam of the affected person, but is usually confirmed by doing a CT (computed tomography) scan of the head, which shows the bleed. If the diagnosis is still uncertain, a sample of fluid from around the spinal cord will be taken (a lumbar puncture) and investigated for blood. Other tests may be done to confirm the diagnosis or look for the cause, including an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan of the head and angiography (injecting dye into blood vessels and doing a scan to look at their size and structure).",Treatment,"A subarachnoid hemorrhage is a medical emergency and requires urgent review and treatment. Life-saving measures, such as help with breathing and blood pressure, may be needed in the time directly following the bleed, especially if the bleed is big enough to cause an large increase in the pressure inside the head. Pain relief is usually given to treat the headache. Some medications are given in the short-term to reduce the risk of a further bleed, to improve the blood supply to the brain and to treat any symptoms, such as seizures.

,,,,,,,,,,What is subluxation and dislocation of the hip?,"Dislocation of the hip refers to a state in which the head of the thigh bone (the femur) is brought out of the socket of the hip joint (the acetabulum) and the two joint surfaces are separated. The injured hip is usually painful and it may not be possible to bear weight on the leg. A hip dislocation should be reviewed urgently by a doctor, and the bones should be relocated as quickly as possible. Once the joint is repositioned, most people recover well.",Risks,"A hip dislocation occurs when the thigh bone is knocked out of the hip joint socket. Hip dislocations are more common in old age. People who have had a hip replacement are at special risk of developing a hip dislocation, and this is one of the more common causes.

,,,,,,,,,,What is subluxation or dislocation of the radial head?,"Subluxation or dislocation of the radial head is a common injury of the elbow joint. This condition, also referred to as a 'pulled elbow', 'babysitter’s elbow', or 'nursemaid’s elbow' is caused by a quick pull to the forearm. It is most common in children younger than six, though older children and adults can also develop this condition if the force on their arm is strong enough. People with this condition tend to hold the dislocated arm close to their body, and are unwilling to use the arm. They may report pain in the arm, and there may be a small amount of swelling around the elbow joint. Normally, the dislocation of the forearm (radial) bone is relocated by a doctor and complications are uncommon. People who may be experiencing the condition can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.",Risks,"There are two bones in the forearm, the radius and the ulna. Both of these bones meet the bone of the upper arm, the humerus, at the elbow. The radius bone can be easily dislocated at the elbow in children, especially if the arm is straightened, because of their small size and small arm muscles. It is most common in children younger than six, though older children and adults can also develop this condition if the force on their arm is strong enough. This dislocation most commonly occurs when a child is holding hands with an older child or adult, who suddenly pulls on the child's arm, causing the bone to pop out of place.",Symptoms,"People with this condition tend to hold the dislocated arm close to their body, and are unwilling to use the arm. They may report pain in the arm, and there may be a small amount of swelling around the elbow joint. If the injury is very severe, there might be a large amount of swelling around the elbow, the hand may become pale, and the child may complain of pins and needles in their arm (or a feeling that they hit their funny bone).",People who may be experiencing the condition can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.,Diagnosis,"The diagnosis of this injury is made based on a description of the injury, the symptoms and physical examination of the arm. An X-ray may be needed to check for broken bones before putting the bone back into place (relocation).",Treatment,"The dislocated bone is usually quickly and easily relocated by a doctor. This is usually not very painful, and most children do not need any calming medication or pain relief for this procedure.

However, there is no evidence that these treatments offer any benefit over placebo or standard care plans of rest and physical therapy.[50]",Pharmaceutical treatments,Medication,Pain-killing medication may be useful in the short term to manage the pain of tendonitis. Medication should be used to ease any pain felt while resting the joint as it heals. Any attempt to mask pain while continuing with activity will risk damaging the tendon further.,"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, can help where the tendon is swollen. However, not all cases of tendonitis are inflammatory and may instead be caused by degeneration of the tendon. In such cases, painkillers such as paracetamol may be as effective.[53] A doctor will be able to advise on the most appropriate option. Painkillers should only be taken for a limited period of time.",Steroids,Corticosteroid injections into the site of tendonitis can provide short-term pain relief. Injections are administered by a health professional and can offer relief from pain for up to 48 hours.[54][55],Injections of corticosteroids should never be given to the heel as they are thought to increase the chance of Achilles tendon rupture. Ruptures of the Achilles tendon have been reported after a single use of corticosteroid injections. Repeated injections into the same site or into a tendon should be avoided as this can also increase the risk of tendon rupture.[56][50],Surgery,"Tendonitis that does not respond to rest, painkillers or physical therapy may be referred for surgery. The type of surgery will depend on the location and severity of the condition. Types of surgery that may be suggested include:[10][24][57][58]","
Debridement and repair, which is the removal of damaged parts of the tendon. This is performed if less than 50 percent of the tendon is damaged.
Debridement with tendon transfer, which is performed when more than 50 percent of the tendon is damaged. The remaining tendon is supported with tendon tissue moved from elsewhere in the body. In Achilles surgery, for example, tendon tissue is taken from the big toe.
Releasing the sheath or pulley, which is performed for De Quervain’s tendonitis and other tendonitis conditions of the hand and wrist, where a mechanical problem is preventing the tendon from functioning normally.
","Surgery for tendonitis is rare, as cases usually improve with rest and non-surgical treatment.[2]",Complications of tendonitis,"If tendonitis is left untreated, the affected tendons may rupture. A rupture occurs when the tendon partially or completely tears away from the bone.

A: Tennis elbow is a form of tendonitis called lateral epicondylitis. It is caused by overuse of the tendons on the outside of the elbow. (See Causes of tendonitis.)","Q: How do you cure tendonitis?
A: Unless the tendonitis is severe enough to need surgery, time, rest and physiotherapy exercises should be enough to heal it. How long a person needs to rest and what will help the process, depends on how damaged the tendon is. (See Treatment for tendonitis.)","Q: How do I ease the pain of tendonitis?
A: If possible, reduce use of the joint that has tendonitis and rest it. A brace or splint can help stop the joint moving while it heals. If pain persists, painkillers such as ibuprofen or paracetamol can help for a short period of time. Putting ice on the joint can also provide temporary relief. Severe pain in some joints can be treated with corticosteroid injections. (See Treatment for tendonitis.)","Q: Can tendonitis go away?
Tendonitis can go away if the affected joint is rested. Continuing with activities that put strain on the affected tendon will not allow the tissue to heal, and risks making the condition worse."

Paracetamol: Available over the counter from pharmacies and other stores, paracetamol can be effective in relieving the pain of a tension headache. It is most effective when taken as soon as the headache develops, and a second dose can be taken after around four hours.
Anti-inflammatory medication: Some types of anti-inflammatory medications, such as Ibuprofen, are available over the counter,  and others require a prescription, such as naproxen. They can be effective in relieving pain, but may in some cases lead to side-effects such as stomach problems.
Aspirin: They can be effective in relieving pain but may lead to stomach-related side effects. For this reason, some doctors will not advise the use of aspirin.
","Before using any form of medication, the patient information leaflet accompanying it should be read in full and its instructions followed. Combining different forms of medication is generally not advised.",During the headache,"During the headache episode itself, certain relaxation techniques can aid a speedy recovery and help reduce pain. These include:","
Hydration: Drinking plenty of water throughout the day can help ease the pain. Room temperature water is the best option, because ice-cold water can cause headaches in some people.
Relaxation: Getting plenty of rest and lying or sitting in a comfortable position can help a headache pass quickly. Creating a quiet, dark environment by drawing the curtains/blinds or wearing an eye mask can also help, because in some people light makes headaches worse.
Breathing and muscle relaxation exercises: Deep breathing exercises can help relax the body, easing the tension related to a headache. Likewise, muscle relaxation exercises can help to reduce tension and pressure in the head and neck area. Doctors will be able to recommend a variety of techniques to practice during a headache.
Light exercise: For tension headaches, non-intensive exercise activities, such as yoga, walking or relaxed cycling can help alleviate the headache symptoms. If the weather is fine, these gentle exercise activities, can ideally be carried out outdoors, in order to breathe in fresh air.
",Tension-type headache prevention,A number of measures can be taken to help prevent tension headaches.,These include:,"
Headache diary: Keeping a diary of when and where headaches takes place, as well as how severe the headaches are, can be useful in identifying headache triggers. Using this information, it may become easier to avoid these triggers.
Stress relief and lifestyle changes: In many cases, stress is a contributing factor to tension headaches. Relaxation techniques such as meditation, yoga or other methods like  acupuncture may be effective in preventing headaches. Furthermore, a regular exercise regime and a healthy, balanced diet can help prevent tension headaches by reducing the overall-stress level.
Medication: In some cases, particularly when headaches are frequent and severe, preventive medication may be advised by a doctor. Amitriptyline – an antidepressant – is the most commonly prescribed medication for this purpose.

,,,,,,,,,,What is testicular cancer?
,,,,,,,,,,What is testicular cancer?,"Testicular cancer is a rare cancer that arises from the testicles. The testicles are male reproductive organs within the scrotum (scrotal sac) that produce sperm and the male hormone, testosterone. It is the most common cancer in young men between ages 15 and 35. The most common symptoms of testicular cancer are a painless lump or swelling in either testicle and a feeling of heaviness in the scrotum. However the cancer may show no symptoms. Surgical removal of the cancer is the primary treatment. Other treatment options are generally based on the stage of testicular cancer. Many people recover well after treatment for testicular cancer.",Risks,"Cancer occurs when abnormal cells grow uncontrollably. These cells destroy the healthy cells around them and can spread into other parts of the body. Testicular cancer occurs when this takes place in the testicle. Although testicular cancer is one of the less common cancers overall, it is one of the most common solid cancers in men between the ages of 20 and 35. Older men and younger boys also can get this cancer, but this is less common. The cause of testicular cancer is not known. Men who have a family member who has had testicular cancer may be more likely to also develop testicular cancer. Men with HIV, who had an undescended testicle as a child ( a condition where the testicle is not in the scrotum) or who have a chromosomal condition called Klinefelter syndrome also have a higher risk of developing testicular cancer.",Symptoms,"The most common symptoms is a painless lump or swelling affecting the testicle. Other symptoms include a feeling of heaviness, pain or swelling of the scrotum (the muscular bag which holds the testicles). Some people feel the pain and heaviness in the lower part of their abdomen. Some men may develop breast tissue, but this is uncommon.",Diagnosis,"The diagnosis is made based on the physical examination of the scrotum, blood tests and a ultrasound scan of the scrotum and CT scan of the abdomen. The diagnosis is confirmed when a small sample (biopsy) of the testicle shows cancer. Further scans and tests may be done to see if the cancer has spread.",Treatment,"Treatment depends on the size of the cancer, the specific type of cancer, and whether it has spread elsewhere in the body. This determines the stage of the cancer. In most cases, the cancer and affected testicle will be surgically removed. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy are chosen depending on the stage and type of testicular cancer. The treating doctor can give the best advice in individual cases. These treatments can cause infertility. If the man would like to have children in the future, sperm banking before treatment is an option. Emotional support via individual counseling or a support group is helpful in coming to terms with the diagnosis and while undergoing treatment.",Prevention,"Self examination of the testicles can help to detect testicular cancer in early stages, which could be helpful in successful treatment."
,,,,,,,,,,What is testicular torsion?
,,,,,,,,,,What is testicular torsion?,"Testicular torsion describes a condition in which the testicle becomes twisted in the scrotum. This causes the blood supply to the testicle to become blocked, and is an emergency because the testicle can die due to a lack of oxygen. Newborns, children and adolescents are most commonly affected. The most common symptom is sudden groin pain, often accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The diagnosis may be based on an ultrasound of the scrotum. The treatment is surgery to untwist the testicle and to re-position it in the scrotum. Surgery should take place as soon as possible to prevent damage to the testicle. With early diagnosis and surgery, most people recover very well.",Risks,"The testicles are usually fixed in the scrotum (the muscular sac which hangs below the penis) from above and behind. In some cases the testicle does not become fixed, and twisting becomes possible. Twisting of the testicle blocks the blood vessels to the testicle, which causes the symptoms and can possibly cause death of the testicle. The cause of the twist is not known in many cases, but it can occur following scrotal surgery or an injury to the scrotum. This condition is most common before 2 years of age and between 12 and 18 years of age.",Symptoms,"The most common symptom is sudden groin and scrotum pain. This may be accompanied by nausea and vomiting. In some cases, the scrotum may become red and swollen.",Diagnosis,"The diagnosis is often suspected based on the symptoms and appearance of the scrotum. The diagnosis is usually confirmed with an ultrasound scan or, very commonly, during emergency surgery. Urine and blood tests may also be done to exclude any other cause for the symptoms.",Treatment,"Treatment is a surgical procedure to untwist the testicle and fix it to the scrotum. If the testicle has been severely damaged, it will be removed.",Prevention,"Although it is not possible to prevent testicular torsion, good surgical management can prevent the testicle from becoming twisted again."
,,,,,,,,,,What is testosterone?
,,,,,,,,,,What is testosterone?,"Testosterone is a predominantly male sex hormone, belonging to a group of androgens (steroids) that are central to sexual and reproductive development. Females also produce testosterone, although in smaller quantities.","In males, testosterone is produced primarily in the testes, by the Leydig cells. In females, testosterone is mainly produced in the ovaries, which also produce estrogen. In both sexes, a small amount of testosterone is also produced in the adrenal glands.","Testosterone levels can fluctuate greatly, even over the course of a single day. The overall level of testosterone in the body tends to decrease as a result of aging. A deficiency of the hormone can also occur prenatally and during puberty. Some individuals may experience unusually high levels of testosterone. This is most common in children and young adults and also occurs in some females, as a result of a variety of underlying medical conditions.","Testosterone therapy, a treatment method involving an artificial form of the hormone, may be necessary for those experiencing low levels of testosterone. There are, however, possible side-effects, such as a lowered sperm count and acne, as well as cardiovascular problems.[1]",What does testosterone do?,"Given its role in several bodily processes, testosterone is considered highly important to the overall health of males and females.","During the gestation of a fetus, testosterone is critical to the development of the internal and external male sex organs. The hormone also plays an important role during puberty, helping to enact many of the bodily changes that take place as the body matures.",Changes that occur during puberty include:,"
Growing taller
Developing pubic and body hair
In males, the enlargement of the penis and testes
Behavioral changes
","During and after puberty – in males and females – testosterone also helps to enhance the libido and, in males, to produce sperm.[2]","By encouraging the production of red blood cells, testosterone also helps to maintain healthy bones and muscle.",How is testosterone controlled?,"The human male and female reproductive cycles are controlled by the interaction of hormones from the brain’s hypothalamus and anterior pituitary[3] with hormones from reproductive tissues and organs. In both sexes, the hypothalamus monitors and causes the release of hormones from the pituitary gland.",Low levels of testosterone,"Low testosterone, or a testosterone deficiency, can occur prenatally, during puberty and develop in adult males and sometimes females, too.","If the deficiency occurs prenatally (during pregnancy), the sexual development and process of masculinization may be affected as a male child matures. A male child with low levels of testosterone may experience delayed puberty, which will typically involve slow or no growth and a failure to develop the characteristics associated with puberty, including penis and testes enlargement, voice deepening and pubic and body hair growth. Those with a testosterone deficiency may also struggle to develop normal muscle mass and have lesser endurance capabilities.[2]","A testosterone deficiency can also develop as a result of aging, as well as being associated with conditions including obesity, type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure. The symptoms of a testosterone deficiency may be physical and psychological in nature.[4]",Testosterone deficiency in males may include the following symptoms:,Physical,"
Change in sleep patterns - insomnia or sleep disturbances
Increased body fat and reduced muscle mass
Reduced sexual desire, sexual dysfunction or infertility
",Psychological,"
Decreased motivation
Depression
","A decreased libido and general fatigue are the most common symptoms of a testosterone deficiency. However, some males with low levels of testosterone may experience no symptoms at all, or only some of the symptoms listed above.",Females can also experience testosterone deficiency. Symptoms of testosterone deficiency in females may include:,Physical,"
Loss of muscle mass and strength
Loss of libido
",Psychological,"
Lethargy
Lack of motivation
Low levels of wellbeing
Low mood
",High levels of testosterone,"The effects of high levels of testosterone in males and females largely depends on age. In children with high testosterone levels, it may lead to different presentation of the secondary sexual characteristics, typically more evident ones, and may include premature signs of puberty and growth spurts. This may result in a condition known as precocious puberty, wherein puberty occurs at an unusually early age, generally considered to be before the age of eight in girls and nine in boys. Precocious puberty can lead to less positive outcomes in physical development, as well as psychological changes, such as increased anger, which have been linked to higher testosterone production. However, this can generally be managed with treatment.[5]","Unusually high levels of testosterone in a female may be diagnosed as hyperandrogenism, a condition involving an excess of androgens (male sex hormones, including testosterone) in the body. Symptoms of hyperandrogenism can include acne, hirsutism (excessive body hair), virilization (typical masculine traits) and reproductive problems when presenting in females of reproductive age.[6][7] In most cases, the condition develops as a result of an underlying medical condition, including various diseases of the ovaries, adrenal gland and pituitary gland. Treatment will generally involve treating the underlying cause of the condition and possible hormone therapy.[8]",Testosterone replacement therapy,"In people with unusually low levels of testosterone, testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) may be recommended by a doctor. While more commonly prescribed for males, TRT is sometimes prescribed for females, too.[9]","Testosterone replacement therapy comes in a variety of forms, including:[10]","
Skin patches (transdermal patches): A patch worn on the arms or upper body.
Mouth patch: A patch applied twice a day, that sticks to the gum above the incisor tooth.
Gels: Applied directly to the skin.
Injections: Injected directly into the muscle and absorbed into the bloodstream.
","TRT should not be undertaken by anyone with normal testosterone levels to enhance sexual performance, for the purposes of bodybuilding or to prevent the natural results of aging. Before recommending TRT, a doctor will typically perform a full physical examination and carry out blood tests to accurately diagnose a testosterone deficiency.[11]",Side-effects of testosterone replacement therapy,"Before advising TRT, a doctor will explain the possible side-effects of the treatment method. These may include:[12]","
Reduced sperm count and possible infertility
Reduction in testicle size
Acne
Breast swelling or soreness in females
High red blood cell count
Swelling of the ankles or feet
","Testosterone supplements can have serious side-effects, and the long-term risks are not yet fully known. There seems to be a direct correlation with an increase in cardiovascular problems. Testosterone supplements should only be prescribed by a doctor, after confirming that a person’s testosterone levels are low enough to need treatment.[13]",Testosterone FAQs,"Q: What are normal levels of testosterone?
A: Testosterone levels vary according to the age and sex of a person. For adult males, the range considered to be normal in blood tests, is approximately 270 to 1100 nanograms per deciliter. For adult females, it is considered to be approximately 6-86 nanograms per deciliter.[14] However, the ranges used tend to differ by laboratory. If a person’s testosterone levels appear to be low, testosterone replacement therapy will typically only be recommended where symptoms are also present.[15][16][17][18]","Q: Is it possible to increase one’s testosterone levels naturally?
A: A number of over-the-counter supplements claim to use natural ingredients to increase a person’s testosterone levels. However, the effects and safety of these supplements has not been widely studied. It is not advisable to take any kind of testosterone supplement that has not been prescribed by a doctor who has deemed treatment necessary.[19]",It may be possible to help promote healthy levels of testosterone by making lifestyle changes that include:[20],"

,,,,,,,,,,What is tetanus?,"Tetanus is an infection caused by bacteria (Clostridium tetani) that often leads to painful muscle spasms. Tetanus is sometimes called lockjaw, because the jaw muscles are commonly affected in the early stages. This bacteria lives in soil and can enter the body through breaks in the skin. This is a rare condition that can affect any person who is not vaccinated against tetanus, and tends to most commonly occur in older people who have not kept up with booster vaccinations. The typical symptoms of this condition are muscle stiffness, fever, sweating and painful muscular spasms. The diagnosis can be made based on the symptoms and physical exam in a person who is at risk. Treatment includes antibiotics and antibodies (proteins which fight infection) against the tetanus bacteria and the tetanus toxin. Tetanus can be a life-threatening condition if not treated appropriately.",Risks,"Tetanus is a condition caused by a bacteria called Clostridium. This bacteria is found in soil and animal manure. It enters the body through cuts, scrapes, body piercings, deep wounds and other injuries which break the skin. When in the body, the bacteria begins to grow, and produces a toxin (a harmful substance) which affects the nerves and muscles, causing the symptoms of tetanus. Tetanus can affect any person who is not vaccinated, but tends to most commonly affect older people, who have not kept up with booster vaccinations. Since routine vaccination was introduced, tetanus has become an uncommon condition.",Symptoms,"The typical symptoms are muscle stiffness, fever, sweating and painful muscle spasms.

,,,,,,,,,,What is thalassemia?
,,,,,,,,,,What is thalassemia?,Thalassemia is an umbrella term for a group of genetic disorders affecting the body’s red blood cells.,"People with thalassemia do not produce enough hemoglobin, an iron-rich protein within red blood cells that helps circulate oxygen throughout the body. A lack of hemoglobin can lead to symptoms of anemia such as fatigue and shortness of breath. People with thalassemia may also develop other health problems, such as slow growth, facial bone deformities, and an enlarged spleen, liver or heart.[1]","Normal hemoglobin has four protein chains, two known as alpha globin and two known as beta globin. The two main types of thalassemia, alpha and beta, are named after hereditary defects in these protein chains. Each of these types has further subtypes, which are described in more detail later in the document.","Depending on which part of the hemoglobin protein is affected, thalassemia can vary from a mild condition to a serious or life-threatening condition that requires long-term treatment and management.","Thalassemia is not caused by any environmental factors and it is not possible to catch it.[2] The disorder is most common in people of Mediterranean, South Asian, Southeast Asian and Middle Eastern origin.[3]",Symptoms,"The symptoms of thalassemia are wide ranging, and vary according to the type of thalassemia a person has.","Those with thalassemia trait, also known as thalassemia carriers, will usually have no symptoms, or possibly mild anemia.",Symptoms of thalassemia may include:[1][2],Anemia,"Anemia refers to a lack of red blood cells or hemoglobin in the blood.

Genes come in pairs, with one set inherited from the mother and one set inherited from the father. For the hemoglobin protein, two normal genes – one from each parent – are required to make healthy beta chains.","If a person inherits two faulty beta thalassemia genes, that person will develop beta thalassemia major, also known as Cooley’s disease. Babies with this condition will often seem healthy at first, but usually develop symptoms of thalassemia within the first two years of life. It is typically a serious and lifelong condition, requiring long-term treatment and management.","If a person inherits only one faulty beta thalassemia gene they will have thalassemia trait and become a carrier of thalassemia disease. They will generally be healthy or sometimes have mild anemia. However, they are at risk of passing on more severe thalassemia to their children.","Thalassemia intermedia is used to describe the disorder that occurs when a person has inherited two faulty beta genes, but the faults are less severe than in beta thalassemia major. People with this condition usually have moderately severe anemia and sometimes require blood transfusions.","Four normal genes – two from each parent – are required to make healthy alpha chains, so alpha thalassemia involves four potentially faulty genes, rather than just two.","A person who inherits one or two faulty alpha genes will be a carrier, without symptoms, except sometimes slight anemia.","If they inherit three faulty alpha thalassemia genes, they will develop hemoglobin H disease, with moderate to severe symptoms.","With four faulty genes, alpha thalassemia major will occur, characterized by hydrops fetalis, in which excess fluid builds up in a baby’s body before birth, along with other physical abnormalities. Untreated alpha thalassemia major is almost always fatal, with a baby dying before delivery or shortly after birth. However, it can be diagnosed prenatally, and, if treatment is begun before the baby is born, they can survive.[6] A specialist team will counsel the family about what treatment options may be suitable for their baby.","Women who are pregnant with babies that have inherited alpha thalassemia can also experience serious complications, including dangerously high blood pressure, premature delivery, and abnormal bleeding.[7]",Diagnosis,"Thalassemia is normally diagnosed following blood tests. To make the diagnosis, a blood sample will be taken and analyzed in order to establish what type of hemoglobin is present. Occasionally, if the results prove inconclusive or there is any uncertainty, DNA tests may also be carried out.[8]","Other conditions may present with similar symptoms, such as iron deficiency, vitamin B12 deficiency, erythropoietin deficiency, a bone marrow disorder called Diamond-Blackfan syndrome, and acute leukemia. It is important to identify the cause of a person’s symptoms, as each condition has different clinical consequences and treatment considerations. For instance, iron-deficiency anemia is usually treated with iron supplements, but it can be harmful for a person with thalassemia to take extra iron.","Moderate and severe thalassemias are usually diagnosed in early childhood, because the symptoms, such as severe anemia, will occur within the first few years of life.",Those who have milder forms might be diagnosed after a routine blood test shows anemia.

However, people with anemia from thalassemia trait should not take iron supplements unless a blood test shows they have coexistent iron deficiency.","Besides these general principles above, there are two main treatments for thalassemia:","
blood transfusions
chelation treatment
",Blood transfusions,"Blood transfusions are typically given to people with anemia accompanied by other complications, such as poor growth, enlarged spleen, evidence of heart disease, as well as in the case of pregnancy.[10] Blood transfusions have associated risks and are only carried out when absolutely necessary, so those who have anemia without other symptoms may be advised against a transfusion.[11]","Blood transfusions supply normal red blood cells to the affected person. This corrects the anemia temporarily, improving health and helping children to grow normally. However, the red blood cells have a limited lifespan, so the transfusion is normally repeated every three or four weeks.",Chelation therapy,"People with moderate to severe thalassemia can experience iron building up to unhealthy levels in the body. This happens partly because of blood transfusions, but also because thalassemia causes the body to absorb more iron than normal from food. This can cause damage to internal organs and other potentially life-threatening complications.","Chelation treatment gets rid of excess iron from the body. Medication is given orally or via a drip. Once in the bloodstream, the chemical properties of the medication allow it to bind to excess iron. The medication and excess iron is then excreted from the body in urine or stools. Chelation therapy is usually begun within a year or two of beginning blood transfusions.[12]",Stem cell transplants,"A stem cell transplant is a possible cure for thalassemia, though there are risks of serious complications and even mortality. Stem cell transplants tend to have a better outcome in younger people.[13] This therapy may be considered for a person who has a suitable donor.","A stem call transplant involves the administration of high-dose chemotherapy to eliminate thalassemia-producing cells in the bone marrow, and subsequent replacement with normal blood-making cells from a donor, resulting in a lifelong cure if successful.",Complications,There are various complications that can occur as a result of thalassemia. These include the following:,Growth and development problems,"Children and adolescents with thalassemia may experience unusual bone growth as the bone marrow expands to try and make more blood cells, such as:","
An enlarged forehead or cheeks
Thinning of the bones, known as osteoporosis
","Puberty may be delayed or progress abnormally in teenagers with thalassemia, due to iron build up impairing the function of the pituitary gland. This may lead to complications such as:","
Absence of menstruation, known as amenorrhea
Diminished functioning of the sex organs, known as hypogonadism
Short stature
",Doctors will monitor childhood development closely and may suggest hormone replacement therapy where necessary.[14],Spleen problems,"Anemia can cause the spleen to become enlarged, which, through various mechanisms, may actually make the anemia even worse. Some people with thalassemia will need to have an operation to remove their spleen. The spleen is a key part of the immune system and, if it is removed, a person will need immunizations and daily antibiotics to protect against certain infections such as pneumonia and meningitis.[15]",Other complications,Other possible complications include:[2],"

",FAQs,"Q: Alpha vs beta thalassemia - what are the main differences between them?
A: Thalassemia is an umbrella term that includes several diseases, all caused by a defect in the production of hemoglobin, the protein that enables red blood cells to carry oxygen. Normal hemoglobin has two alpha globin and two beta globin protein chains. Alpha and beta thalassemia are named after hereditary defects in these protein chains.","In their minor form, both alpha and beta thalassemia cause no symptoms, or only mild anemia. However, in their major forms, alpha is almost always fatal before birth, whereas beta is not immediately fatal because some production of healthy hemoglobin is still possible. However, without treatment there is severe anemia, and possible complications involving the bones, liver, spleen and heart.","Q: Can thalassemia be cured?
A: Stem cell transplantation is a possible cure for the condition. This involves high-dose chemotherapy to eliminate thalassemia-producing cells in the marrow, and subsequent replacement with normal blood-making cells from a donor, resulting in a lifelong cure if successful. However, there are potentially serious risks associated with stem cell transplantation, such as infection, organ failure, and even death.

",Some people may experience weight gain due to increased appetite in hyperthyroidism.,"Because some of these symptoms can be experienced in pregnancy without hyperthyroidism, they may be overlooked by a healthcare practitioner. If any of these symptoms are present and a person is concerned that they may have an undiagnosed thyroid condition, it is recommended that they make this known to their healthcare practitioner. If you are worried about any symptoms, you can use the Ada app for a free assessment.",Causes,"The most common cause of hyperthyroidism in pregnancy is Graves' disease – an autoimmune condition in which a person’s immune system mistakenly stimulates the thyroid gland to produce excessive thyroid hormone. Hyperthyroidism during pregnancy can also, rarely, arise from hyperemesis gravidarum – a condition that causes severe nausea and vomiting during the first few months.[2]",Diagnosis,"A doctor will typically take the individual’s medical history and perform a physical examination, then request blood tests to check the levels of thyroid hormone.[2] High levels of thyroid hormone may indicate that hyperthyroidism is present.",Treatment,"Mild hyperthyroidism in pregnancy typically does not require treatment. If the hyperthyroidism is more severe, it is usually treated with low doses of antithyroid medications, which reduce the production of thyroid hormone. In the first trimester, propylthiouracil is usually prescribed. In the second and third trimesters, the medication may be changed to methimazole or carbimazole to minimize the risk of toxicity.[2][16]","It will typically be necessary for a person with hyperthyroidism to have their thyroid hormone levels tested frequently during the pregnancy, and their medication adjusted as needed. It may be possible to lower the dose or even stop taking the medication during the third trimester, as Graves' disease sometimes goes into remission.[16] Approximately six weeks after delivery,[11] a doctor will typically check the person’s thyroid hormone levels again and advise on the treatment or treatment regimen changes necessary, if any.","In rare cases, surgery may be considered to remove all or part of the thyroid gland. This is usually only considered where the person cannot tolerate antithyroid drugs. Radioactive iodine treatment, while sometimes used in the management of hyperthyroidism, is not a safe option for pregnant people because of the risk of damage to the baby’s thyroid gland.[2][16]",Complications,"If it is not properly managed, hyperthyroidism in pregnancy can lead to a number of possible complications for both the parent and baby. These may include:[2][16]","
Preeclampsia, a potentially serious condition characterized by high blood pressure and protein in the urine of the mother[13]
High blood pressure
Congestive heart failure
Thyroid storm, sudden, severe worsening of hyperthyroid symptoms
Fetal tachycardia, fast heart rate of the baby
Thyroid problems in the baby[5]
Low birth weight of the baby
Premature birth
Miscarriage
Stillbirth
","Improperly treated hyperthyroidism can also make it difficult to conceive.[4] However, with appropriate treatment, it is generally possible to have a safe and healthy pregnancy.[4][16]","It is recommended that people with existing hyperthyroidism or a high risk of developing hyperthyroidism consult with a healthcare practitioner prior to trying to conceive, so that their thyroid hormone levels can be optimized to help ensure a healthy pregnancy.[4]",Read more about Hyperthyroidism »,Other types of thyroid problems during pregnancy,"While less common, a number of other types of thyroid conditions may affect pregnant people, without necessarily being related to the pregnancy. These include acute infectious thyroiditis, De Quervain’s thyroiditis, Riedel’s thyroiditis and several other thyroid disorders.[8] Treatment will depend on the type and severity of the disorder. If any thyroid condition is suspected, it is important to consult with a healthcare practitioner without delay.",Read more about Thyroiditis »,Postpartum thyroiditis,"Also known as silent thyroiditis, postpartum thyroiditis is a condition sometimes experienced by people who have, within the last 12 months, given birth, or had a miscarriage or medical abortion.[17]",Factors which increase one’s risk of developing postpartum thyroiditis include:[5][18],"
A prior history of thyroid dysfunction
Autoimmune conditions, such as type 1 diabetes
Positive tests for thyroid antibodies
A family history of thyroid conditions
","Thought to be autoimmune in nature, postpartum thyroiditis is a type of inflammation of the thyroid gland. It commonly presents as hypothyroidism, but can also take the form of hyperthyroidism, or a hyperthyroid phase followed by hypothyroidism. Usually, the thyroid function returns to normal.[19][20]","If present, the hyperthyroid phase typically occurs between one and four months after the delivery of the baby and persists for 1-3 months. Symptoms, which include anxiety, difficulty sleeping, tiredness, irritability and a racing heart, among the others listed under symptoms of hyperthyroidism above, may mistakenly be attributed to the stress of having a newborn.[19]","Treatment will depend on the severity of symptoms. Antithyroid medications will generally not be used, but beta-blockers (a class of medication acting on the heart, blood vessels and kidneys, among other parts of the body) may be prescribed to provide relief from some of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, like a fast heart rate, anxiety or trembling hands (tremor).[5][19][20]","If present, the hypothyroid phase typically develops between four and eight months after delivery, and may persist for up to 12 months. Symptoms include depression, tiredness, weight gain, constipation and dry skin, among the others listed under symptoms of hypothyroidism above.[19]","As some of the symptoms are characteristic of the condition known as postpartum blues (the fatigue, lethargy and moodiness that can be experienced after delivery) or postpartum depression, the hypothyroidism can be difficult to recognize. If any symptoms present, it is important to consult with a healthcare practitioner.[2][5] You can also use the Ada app for a free assessment.","If the hypothyroidism is mild, treatment may not be necessary, but in more severe cases levothyroxine may be prescribed for six to 12 months. Thereafter, the medication will usually be tapered to assess whether it is still needed.[5][18] In most cases, thyroid function will return to normal within 12-18 months. However, in some people the hypothyroidism will be permanent, and lifelong treatment with levothyroxine may be necessary.[2][19]","In general, people who have had postpartum thyroiditis will typically be screened once a year to check that their thyroid hormone levels are normal, as they are at an increased risk of developing permanent hypothyroidism later.[5]","If a person who has been pregnant presents with symptoms of hyperthyroidism after delivery, a doctor will typically run tests to make sure that they do not have Graves' disease or another condition that requires different treatment to postpartum thyroiditis.[5][12]",Thyroid and pregnancy FAQs,"Q: Can thyroid problems affect fertility?
A: Yes. An undiagnosed or poorly-controlled thyroid condition can make it difficult to conceive. This is the case with both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. However, a well-managed thyroid condition will not usually cause difficulties.[4]","Q: Is it safe to take thyroid medication during pregnancy?
A: Yes, as long as it is taken as prescribed by a doctor. Medications used to treat hyperthyroidism need to be prescribed carefully to minimize the risk of side-effects to the mother and baby. Doctors will often prescribe propylthiouracil, if it is available, during the first trimester of pregnancy. This medication is less likely to cause birth defects than the other major antithyroid medication, methimazole, but may have more side-effects and, in rare cases, result in liver damage in the mother. To reduce this risk, doctors often switch to methimazole, if medication is still needed, from the second trimester onwards (when it is considered safe to do so). However, birth defects are rare with either medication. In all cases, the lowest possible dose of antithyroid medication is prescribed to avoid the baby’s thyroid function being impaired. Levothyroxine, the medication most commonly used to treat hypothyroidism, is safe provided it is taken as indicated.[2][21]","Q: Can one breastfeed one’s baby while taking thyroid medication?
A:  Yes, provided that they consult with a doctor. Levothyroxine is typically safe for use during breastfeeding, as long as it is taken as prescribed.[4] Antithyroid medication is also generally considered safe for use during breastfeeding, as very little is excreted in the breast milk.[11] However, it may be necessary to adjust the time that the medication is taken, as well as the dose. It may also be necessary for the baby’s thyroid function to be tested from time to time to make sure that thyroid hormone levels are normal.[4]","Q: Should a pregnant person who is generally healthy take an iodine supplement?
A: In many cases, yes. The American Thyroid Association recommends iodine supplementation during pregnancy and lactation for people in the United States and Canada.[22] Supplementation is also recommended in Germany by the German Society of Internal Medicine, and by a number of other health authorities in other parts of the world. Iodine is found in many prenatal vitamin and mineral supplements. Before taking any such supplements, however, it is advisable to consult with a healthcare practitioner.[23]","Q: Should a pregnant person with a thyroid condition take iodine supplements?
A: Not without consulting a healthcare practitioner. While iodine is important for the healthy functioning of the thyroid gland, it is possible that supplementation may worsen existing thyroid conditions. Before taking any supplements containing iodine, it is recommended that pregnant people with thyroid conditions always speak to a doctor.[2]"
,,,,,,,,,,Overview of the thyroid gland
,,,,,,,,,,Overview of the thyroid gland,"The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland found in the lower neck, just beneath the Adam’s apple. The hormones this gland releases control the body’s growth and metabolism. They affect processes like heart rate, digestion and temperature. Thyroid hormones are also essential for healthy mental and physical development.[1][2]","When the levels of thyroid hormone are too high, symptoms of hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) may present, such as increased heart rate, weight loss and anxiety. Conversely, when the levels are abnormally low, there may be symptoms of hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid), like fatigue, weight gain and depression.",What is thyroiditis?,"Thyroiditis is a term for inflammation of the thyroid gland, a condition which causes the levels of thyroid hormone in the body to go beyond the normal range.","Thyroiditis can be caused by several clinical disorders that present in different ways and require different courses of treatment, ranging from medication to surgery. The most common types of thyroiditis include Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, postpartum thyroiditis and De Quervain’s thyroiditis.","Women are far more likely than men to experience thyroid problems.[3] Thyroiditis can be a serious condition, and requires management by a doctor.",What are the symptoms of thyroiditis?,The symptoms of thyroiditis depend on whether the levels of thyroid hormone in the blood are too high (hyperthyroidism or thyrotoxicosis) or too low (hypothyroidism).,"Good to know: Some of the symptoms may occur in both hyper- and hypothyroidism. If you think that you might have signs of a thyroid disorder, try using the Ada app to find out more about your symptoms.",Symptoms of hyperthyroidism (thyrotoxicosis) include:,"
Anxiety or nervousness
Irritability
Increased sweating
Heat intolerance
Weight loss or difficulty gaining weight, despite a good appetite
Insomnia (sleeplessness or sleep disturbances)
Racing heart or palpitations (pronounced awareness of one’s heartbeat)[4]
High blood pressure[5]
Increased frequency of bowel movements
Nausea and vomiting[6]
Fatigue (generally feeling tired or weak)
Tremors (shaky hands)
Feeling of weakness in the muscles (particularly in the upper arms and thighs)
Difficulty exercising
Eye bulging and irritation
Light or no menstruation
",Some people may experience weight gain due to increased appetite in hyperthyroidism.[7][8][9][10][11][12],Symptoms of hypothyroidism include:,"
Fatigue (generally feeling tired or weak)
Depression
Forgetfulness
Sensitivity to cold
Dry skin
Poor exercise tolerance
Constipation
Unexplained weight gain
Brittle nails
Hair loss
Tongue enlargement (swelling)
","In addition, there may be menstrual irregularities.[13][14][15]",Thyroid goiter,"People affected by thyroiditis may present with a goiter – the medical term for an enlarged thyroid gland. There may be noticeable swelling in the lower part of the neck. Goiters can be related to hyper or hypothyroidism, as well as thyroid nodules and a number of other conditions that affect the thyroid.","Thyroid goiters are usually painless, but can cause a tight feeling in the throat, hoarseness, coughing, and difficulty swallowing and breathing (if they are very large). A goiter does not necessarily indicate that thyroid function has been compromised, and small thyroid goiters may not require medical treatment.[16]",Types of thyroiditis,"There are a number of different types of thyroiditis. Many of these thyroid problems seem to run in families, and they tend to affect a higher number of women than men.[3]",Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (Hashimoto’s disease),"Also known as chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis or disease - sometimes written as Hashimoto thyroiditis - is the most common type of thyroiditis. It is an autoimmune condition in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the thyroid gland, causing inflammation and gradual damage that can lead to hypothyroidism over time. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is more prevalent among women than men, and is commonly associated with a family history of thyroid disease.[17]","Hashimoto’s thyroiditis tends to progress slowly and can take months or even years to be detected.[1] Those affected may present with a painless goiter, symptoms of hypothyroidism and high levels of thyroid antibodies. Though less common, there may also be symptoms of hyperthyroidism. In some cases, the disease may begin with a period of hyperthyroidism, which leads to hypothyroidism as the thyroid gland becomes damaged. The hypothyroidism, which is often lifelong, is treated with thyroid hormone replacement. Sometimes, periods of thyroid over- and underactivity may alternate over the course of the disease. Regular monitoring and blood tests can help a person manage any thyroid hormone fluctuations that occur.[17]","Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is sometimes associated with other autoimmune conditions, including Addison’s disease, type 1 diabetes, pernicious anemia, celiac disease and connective tissue disorders like rheumatoid arthritis. For more information, see the dedicated page on Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.",Ord’s thyroiditis,"Also known as Ord’s disease, this autoimmune condition is characterized by atrophy of the thyroid gland and hypothyroidism. It is very similar to Hashimoto’s disease, apart from the shrinking of the thyroid gland instead of the development of a goiter. Ord’s disease and Hashimoto’s disease have historically been classified as separate disorders, but research suggests that they may instead be different manifestations of autoimmune thyroiditis, with some medical practitioners calling for the combined term Ord-Hashimoto’s disease to be used.[18]",Silent thyroiditis,"Also known as painless thyroiditis or subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis, this is an autoimmune disease (autoimmune meaning that the immune system attacks healthy cells) that presents with an initial period of hyperthyroidism (three months or less), followed by temporary hypothyroidism.","Silent thyroiditis generally resolves on its own within 12-18 months,[1] though in some cases the hypothyroidism may occasionally be permanent. Treatment may include beta-blockers to relieve the symptoms of hyperthyroidism and thyroid hormone replacement, when necessary, in the hypothyroid phase.",Postpartum thyroiditis,"Sometimes classified as a type of silent thyroiditis, postpartum thyroiditis is a type of thyroiditis after pregnancy that affects people who have recently (within the last 12 months) given birth, or had a miscarriage, or medical abortion.[19] The condition is autoimmune in nature and typically manifests with an initial period of hyperthyroidism, followed by hypothyroidism that may be temporary or permanent. Not all people experience both phases.[1] Postpartum thyroiditis most often affects people with a prior history of thyroid dysfunction, and resembles Hashimoto’s thyroiditis – as does regular silent thyroiditis. They are considered variants of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.[20]",Drug-induced thyroiditis,"Some medications may cause hypothyroidism or, more rarely, hyperthyroidism. Treatment with lithium is known to cause hypothyroidism in 5-15 percent of people and goiter in up to 37 percent.[21] Iodine and iodine-containing medications, such as amiodarone, interleukin-2 (IL-2) or interferon, can also affect thyroid function.[22] Drugs used to treat hyperthyroidism can result in a hypothyroid state, and vice versa, if dosages are incorrect for a particular person. Treatment requires management of medications and dosages with a doctor.",Riedel’s thyroiditis,"Sometimes also called Riedel’s struma or invasive fibrous thyroiditis, this is an extremely rare type of thyroiditis. The cause is unclear, though it is thought to be either an autoimmune or primary fibrotic (referring to an excessive build-up of connective tissue) disorder. Riedel’s thyroiditis typically presents with a hard, painless mass in the front of the neck. As the disease progresses, affected people may experience hoarseness, difficulty swallowing and breathing, as well as choking. There may also be hypothyroidism and hypoparathyroidism. Treatment may involve corticosteroids, thyroid hormone replacement and surgery.[23][24]",De Quervain’s thyroiditis (subacute thyroiditis),"Also known as painful subacute thyroiditis, subacute nonsuppurative thyroiditis, giant cell thyroiditis and subacute granulomatous thyroiditis, this is a relatively rare condition that mostly affects middle-aged women who have recently had a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract. Overall, De Quervain’s thyroiditis is the most common cause of a painful thyroid gland.","The main symptoms of De Quervain’s thyroiditis are fever, pain in the throat and thyroid region of the neck (which may radiate to the jaw and ears) and an enlarged thyroid gland. Initially, a person with De Quervain’s may present with symptoms of hyperthyroidism, as the condition causes the release of high levels of thyroid hormone. This is sometimes followed by a temporary (transient) phase of hypothyroidism.","De Quervain’s thyroiditis is usually self-limiting, with the condition clearing on its own within a few months. Treatment is aimed at minimizing pain and discomfort, and aspirin or another NSAID (Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug), such as ibuprofen may be recommended. In severe cases, a corticosteroid may be prescribed as a potent anti-inflammatory measure. A beta-blocker may be given to ease some of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, like a racing heart, high blood pressure, feeling agitated or having tremors. Antithyroid medication is not usually necessary. The temporary hypothyroidism that is often the last stage of the condition, before patients recover, may necessitate short-term treatment with thyroid hormone replacement.","Thyroid function generally returns to normal (a euthyroid state), though in a few cases De Quervain’s can recur and result in permanent hypothyroidism.[25]",Radiation-induced thyroiditis,"A number of people who undergo radioactive iodine therapy for hyperthyroidism, develop radiation-induced thyroiditis after the procedure. Radiation therapy for certain cancers, such as lymphoma, head and neck cancers, can also trigger thyroiditis.[26] Those affected may present with symptoms of hyper or hypothyroidism,[1] as well as tenderness in the thyroid area. Treatment may involve beta-blockers to alleviate symptoms of temporary (transient) hyperthyroidism, painkillers[26] and thyroid hormone replacement where necessary.[27]",Acute infectious thyroiditis,"This very rare type of thyroiditis, also known as suppurative thyroiditis or acute thyroiditis (to be distinguished from subacute thyroiditis), is caused by an infection of the thyroid gland with bacteria or other microbes. The disease is associated with a weakened immune system that may be caused by any number of reasons or, in the case of children, an abnormality in the development of the thyroid gland.[1] Most people affected by acute infectious thyroiditis have a pre-existing thyroid disorder such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis or thyroid cancer.[28]","Symptoms include pain in the front of the neck, soreness in the throat, fever and a rapid heart rate. Thyroid hormone levels tend to be within the normal range. The cause of infection is typically determined using fine-needle aspiration (a type of biopsy), after which a treatment option will be prescribed. Most likely, this will require antibiotics or other antimicrobial agents and, in the case of an abscess, surgical drainage. Without effective and timely treatment, the condition can potentially be life-threatening.[29]",Diagnosis of thyroiditis (thyroid tests),"A number of diagnostic methods may be used to confirm that thyroiditis or another thyroid condition is present, including blood tests and ultrasound scans.",Blood tests,Thyroiditis is typically diagnosed with a thyroid function test. This is a laboratory blood test that looks at levels of the following:[30],"
TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone)
FT4 (free thyroxine)
FT3 (free triiodothyronine) – only occasionally
","The amount of thyroxine (the thyroid’s main hormone) secreted by the thyroid gland is regulated by the pituitary gland (also called the hypophysis, a small hormone gland located at the base of the brain). The pituitary gland secretes TSH according to the amount of T4 (thyroxine) that is needed. T4 is converted into T3 (triiodothyronine), which is the biologically active form of thyroid hormone.[30]","If the level of TSH is high and the FT4 low in a thyroid blood test, it indicates hypothyroidism. Conversely, if the level of TSH is low and the FT4 high, hyperthyroidism is indicated. The ranges used vary slightly by country and lab.[30]","Where the TSH level is slightly elevated, but the FT4 level is normal, subclinical or mild hypothyroidism is indicated. Because this may progress to full-blown hypothyroidism, follow-up tests may be recommended.[30]","When autoimmune thyroiditis is suspected, a doctor may order further blood tests to see whether thyroid antibodies are present at levels above the reference range. These include thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) and thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb) to confirm Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, and thyroid stimulating hormone receptor antibodies (TSHR Ab), which are also called TSH receptor antibodies (TRAbs), in the case of Graves’ disease.[30]",Thyroid ultrasound,"This non-invasive test may be ordered to check the thyroid gland for swelling and nodules, and blood circulation pattern. An ultrasound is also used to check the parathyroid glands (four glands that are situated on the back of the thyroid and produce parathyroid hormone, which affects the body’s calcium metabolism).[31]",Radioactive iodine uptake test,"In some cases (particularly when hyperthyroidism is present), a radioactive iodine uptake test may be recommended – often together with a thyroid scan (a specialized imaging procedure). In both of these tests, a small amount of a weak radioactive substance is administered.[32]
A radioactive iodine uptake test allows the medical practitioner to determine whether the thyroid gland, which naturally takes up iodine,[33] is functioning normally, and why thyroid hormone levels may be out of range. A scan can detect thyroid nodules and inflammation.[32]",Fine needle aspiration,"If a suspicious thyroid nodule is detected, a fine needle aspiration biopsy may be performed to determine whether it is benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous).[34]",Thyroiditis treatments,"Treatment depends on the type of thyroiditis, as well as its progression. Pain and inflammation caused by thyroiditis may be treated with aspirin, ibuprofen or other anti-inflammatory painkillers (NSAIDs), with the addition of corticosteroids where necessary.",Hypothyroidism,"An underactive thyroid is treated with thyroid hormone replacement. This usually takes the form of levothyroxine (a synthetic/lab-created form of T4), with the dosage determined by the severity of the hypothyroidism, as well as the weight and age of the affected person. Regular thyroid blood tests are necessary to ensure that the levels of thyroid hormone do not become too high (thyrotoxicosis)[35] or remain too low.[36]",Hyperthyroidism,"An overactive thyroid can be treated in a number of ways. There is no single preferred method – the chosen option usually depends on the type and severity of hyperthyroidism, as well as the age and general health of the affected person.","Treatment methods include antithyroid drugs like methimazole, which block the ability of the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormone, radioactive iodine, which destroys the thyroid cells that produce thyroid hormone and thyroid surgery (thyroidectomy), where most of the thyroid gland is removed, and the resultant hypothyroidism is treated with levothyroxine. Beta-blockers may be prescribed to lessen the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, mainly fast heart rate and high blood pressure, while treatments are taking effect.[7]","Because treatment will depend on the type of thyroiditis experienced, consultation with a medical professional is very important. Taking over-the-counter medication without advice from a healthcare provider is not recommended.",Other thyroid conditions,Graves’ disease,"Also known as diffuse toxic goiter and Basedow’s disease, Graves’ disease is an autoimmune condition in which the thyroid gland is stimulated to produce too much thyroid hormone, causing hyperthyroidism or thyrotoxicosis. Like Hashimoto’s disease, it seems to have a genetic component and is more prevalent among women than men. Graves’ disease is one of the most common causes of hyperthyroidism.[35]","People affected by Graves’ disease may present with painless enlargement of the thyroid gland, symptoms of hyperthyroidism and high levels of thyroid antibodies. In addition, there may be symptoms of Graves’ ophthalmopathy, where the eyes are affected by a gritty sensation, pain or pressure. There may also be swollen eyelids, light sensitivity, double vision or bulging eyes, among other symptoms. Graves’ ophthalmopathy is seen in approximately 30 percent of people affected by Graves’ disease. There may also be reddening and thickening of the skin, most often on the shins or tops of the feet. This is called Graves’ dermopathy[37] or pretibial myxedema,[38] and is rare.","The hyperthyroidism is treated with antithyroid medication, radioactive iodine or thyroid surgery. Where permanent hypothyroidism results, levothyroxine is prescribed to replace the thyroid hormone and is typically taken for life.[35]",Thyroid nodules,"Thyroid nodules are lumps in the thyroid gland. They may be solid or filled with fluid. Nodules may be too small to detect without a physical examination, thyroid ultrasound or thyroid scan, or large enough that they are visible and, in rare cases, even obstruct breathing or swallowing.[39]","The majority of thyroid nodules do not cause any symptoms. However, some produce extra thyroxine, which can cause symptoms of hyperthyroidism as thyroid hormone levels go out of range.","Thyroid nodules may be associated with iodine deficiency (rare in the United States, more common in many regions of Europe), overgrowth of normal thyroid tissue (thyroid adenomas) or Hashimoto’s disease, among other conditions.[40][41]","A thyroid nodule may also be a sign of thyroid cancer. However, most thyroid nodules are benign (non-cancerous growths). It is estimated that only two to three out of 20 thyroid nodules are cancerous.[42]","If a thyroid nodule is non-cancerous (benign) and not causing any symptoms, treatment may not be necessary. A doctor may simply opt to perform regular examinations and thyroid function tests to monitor its progress. Large nodules, and those that cause symptoms, may be removed surgically or treated with radioactive iodine (if they are producing thyroxine).[43]",Thyroid cancer,"Thyroid cancer is relatively rare, but rates seem to be increasing. It is thought that this is due to advances in technology which allow medical practitioners to detect small thyroid cancers that may previously have gone unnoticed. Most cases of thyroid cancer are treatable and can be cured, allowing those affected to live a normal life.[44][45]","Early symptoms of thyroid cancer are rarely noticeable. However, in some cases, firm, painless nodules may be noted. Later symptoms may include rapid growth of a goiter, throat hoarseness or pain that does not go away, difficulty swallowing or breathing, pain in the front of the neck and an unexplained cough.[45][46][47]",There are four main types of thyroid cancer:,"
Papillary (the most common type)
Follicular (the second most common type)
Medullary (rare, may run in families)
Anaplastic (rare, an aggressive type of thyroid cancer)
","Treatment depends on the type of thyroid cancer and may involve full (or, in rare cases, partial) removal of the thyroid gland during thyroid surgery, radioactive iodine therapy, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Levothyroxine is prescribed to prevent hypothyroidism after treatment, and is taken for life.[45]",Thyroiditis FAQs,"Q: Is there a special thyroid diet?
A: There is no specific thyroid diet that is recommended for people affected by thyroid disorders. A healthy, balanced diet is generally sufficient. It is not advisable to take special supplements, including iodine preparations, without first consulting a doctor.","Some foods and supplements can, however, interfere with the absorption of levothyroxine, so those taking this medication should keep in mind the following:","
After taking calcium-rich foods or supplements, wait four hours before taking levothyroxine
After taking iron tablets, wait two hours before taking levothyroxine
Wait as long as possible after taking levothyroxine before eating soya or soy products
","In addition, kelp and iodine supplements should be avoided unless otherwise recommended by a healthcare provider, as they can potentially aggravate thyroid disorders. A healthy, varied diet usually provides sufficient amounts of iodine. In many countries, where the normal diet contains too little iodine, table salt is iodized, meaning it has iodine added to it, to help prevent iodine deficiency from occurring.","Vegetables of the Brassica family, such as cabbage, broccoli and kale, may be implicated in the development of a goiter in some people, but only in very rare cases where consumption is extremely high. It is not a problem under normal dietary conditions.[48]","Q: What is thyroid hair loss?
A: This is the phrase used to describe the loss of hair that may occur in severe, prolonged hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. The hair loss tends to affect the entire scalp, as opposed to small areas, and the hair may appear sparse. There may also be loss of eyebrow hair. Thyroid hair loss is unusual in mild thyroid disorders.","The hair typically grows back once the thyroid disorder has been successfully treated. However, this may take a few months, and regrowth is not always complete.[49] Partial hair loss is listed as a possibility during the first few months of treatment with levothyroxine.[50] In rare cases, antithyroid drugs may also be associated with hair loss.[49]","Q: What precautions need to be taken with the thyroid in pregnancy?
A: Normal levels of thyroid hormone in an expectant mother are essential for the healthy development of the baby. People with pre-existing thyroid conditions may need to adjust the dosage of their medication during pregnancy, with regular thyroid function tests to ensure that their thyroid hormone levels are within the optimal range.","In some parts of the world, such as Germany, pregnant women may be encouraged to take iodine supplements to compensate for deficiencies in the soil and the lack of fortification of food products. A doctor will be able to advise on whether supplementation is necessary. For more information, see the thyroid and pregnancy resource.","People who develop symptoms of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism while pregnant need to seek immediate medical care. If symptoms of postpartum thyroiditis are present after the delivery of the baby, the mother should consult with a doctor. Postpartum thyroiditis may be mistaken for postpartum depression.[9]","Q: Can thyroiditis cause cancer?
A: While thyroiditis itself does not cause cancer, some types of thyroiditis, e.g. Hashimoto’s disease, may be associated with an increase in a person’s risk of developing thyroid cancer and certain other types of cancer.[51][52] It is advisable to speak to a doctor about any cancer concerns you may have.","Q: Can thyroiditis recur?
A: Yes, thyroiditis can come back or return, meaning that the condition can occur more than once. A person may also experience repeat episodes of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism as a result of some types of thyroiditis.","Q: Can thyroiditis cause a sore throat?
A: Yes, a sore throat can be a sign of some types of thyroiditis, such as subacute thyroiditis and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. See the dedicated sections above for more information.[53][54]","Q: Can thyroiditis cause swollen lymph nodes?
A: Swollen lymph nodes in the neck can be a sign of thyroiditis that is autoimmune in nature, e.g. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, as well as in acute infectious thyroiditis. However, swollen lymph glands can also be a sign of many other conditions. If you have swollen lymph nodes and other signs of a thyroid problem, it is advisable to consult a doctor.[55][56]","Q: Can a thyroid nodule cause weight gain?
A: Most thyroid nodules themselves do not affect a person’s weight. However, a thyroid nodule can be associated with Hashimoto’s disease, which is a thyroid condition that can lead to weight gain and other symptoms of hypothyroidism.","Q: Do I have thyroiditis?
A: If you think that you might have thyroiditis, try using the Ada app to find out more about your symptoms, and consult a doctor."
,,,,,,,,,,What is tonsillitis?
,,,,,,,,,,What is tonsillitis?,"Tonsillitis is an inflammatory condition of the tonsils. It can be either caused by infection with bacteria or viruses. A sore throat and swallowing difficulties are among the main symptoms. Usually, tonsillitis is a temporary condition which lasts for about a week. Anti-inflammatory medicines (such as ibuprofen) are helpful in reducing pain and swelling. Bacterial infections might need treatment with antibiotics. Proper treatment usually leads to total recovery, but can take up to 10 days.",Risks,"Tonsillitis can affect people of every age, but children tend to get tonsillitis more often. It is very often caused by common viruses (cold or flu viruses) and sometimes by viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus (infective mononucleosis, also known as mono or glandular fever), croup or hand-foot-and-mouth disease. Tonsillitis is often caused by bacteria, especially in children. The most common bacteria that infects the tonsils is streptococcus (strep throat). Symptoms are caused by infection of the tonsils causing swelling and pain.",Symptoms,"Typical symptoms are a sore throat, swelling and pain when swallowing. The lining of the throat may be red with yellow or white patches. Some people also develop headache and a fever. Some people may develop also a rash, muscle pain or belly pain. These symptoms should be reviewed by a doctor. Rare but serious symptoms include drooling, difficulty breathing and swelling of the neck. These symptoms are signs of a complication and should be reviewed urgently by a doctor.",Diagnosis,The diagnosis is usually made by assessing the symptoms and examining the throat. It may be necessary to have a blood test or to take a sample of mucus from the tonsils to test for specific causes of tonsillitis.,Treatment,"The choice of treatment mostly depends on the cause (i.e. whether bacterial or viral). Anti-inflammatory medicines (such as ibuprofen) are helpful in reducing pain and swelling. Many people also eat cold, soft food to reduce their symptoms. If the condition is caused by bacteria, the treatment may involve antibiotics. Surgical removal of the tonsils may be required if the infections are persistent or recurrent.",Prevention,"Taking care to prevent the spread of colds or the flu in the home and community can help prevent some cases of tonsillitis. People with tonsillitis, especially children, should avoid school or day care until their symptoms begin to improve."
,,,,,,,,,,What is a trachelectomy?
,,,,,,,,,,What is a trachelectomy?,"A trachelectomy, sometimes called a cervicectomy, is a surgical procedure used to treat early-stage cervical cancer. The definition of a radical trachelectomy – the most common form of this procedure – is the removal of the cervix and part of the vagina. The ovaries and the uterus are left in place, with the uterus connected to the vagina by an artificial band.[1] The doctor may also remove the lymph nodes near the cervix. A simple trachelectomy, which is less often performed, removes only the cervix.",Trachelectomy compared to other surgeries,"A trachelectomy is one of several common surgical procedures used to treat cervical cancer. The method selected depends on multiple factors, including a woman’s age, desire to maintain fertility and the cancer’s stage of development. Non-surgical treatments include radiation and chemotherapy, both of which include a risk of possible side-effects.",Trachelectomy vs. hysterectomy,"A trachelectomy is an alternative to a hysterectomy, which removes both the uterine body and the cervix. In some cases, a hysterectomy will also remove the fallopian tubes, ovaries, some surrounding tissue, the nearby lymph nodes or part of the vaginal canal. A person cannot become pregnant following a hysterectomy.[2] While a hysterectomy is the most common surgical procedure used to treat cervical cancer, a trachelectomy may be more appropriate in the early stages of the cancer, as it is able to preserve a person’s fertility.[3]",Trachelectomy vs. conization (cone biopsy),"Both of these procedures can help treat early-stage cervical cancer, but a radical trachelectomy is more extensive. A radical trachelectomy removes the entire cervix and part of the vagina, whereas a conization (cone biopsy) removes only a cone-shaped portion of the cervix containing the cancer cells. A loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) is similar to a cone biopsy, and is performed with an electrified wire loop.[4] A simple trachelectomy removes only the cervix, and in some ways is more similar to a large conization.[5]",Trachelectomy vs. pelvic exenteration,"During a pelvic exenteration, the cervix, ovaries, vagina, lymph nodes, lower colon, bladder and rectum are removed.[4] This major surgical procedure is typically reserved for recurrent or very advanced cancers in the pelvic area. These may include cancers of the female reproductive organs and colorectal cancer, if it has spread.[6]",Non-surgical alternatives to a trachelectomy,"Radiotherapy is a very common non-surgical treatment option. It can be used to treat cervical cancer of different stages, with the decision hinging on factors, such as the desire to retain fertility and the likelihood of complications. In some cases, radiotherapy will be used in combination with chemotherapy – which is known as chemoradiotherapy – or in combination with surgery.",Trachelectomy vs. radiotherapy,"Radiotherapy uses high-energy X-rays to destroy cancerous cells. It can be delivered either externally, using a large, specially designed machine which beams X-rays into the pelvis, or internally, whereby a radioactive tube is placed inside the vagina, adjacent to the tumor.[7] Generally, a combination of the two methods is used. Radiotherapy may involve a variety of side-effects, including the risk of infertility. For this reason, a trachelectomy may be preferred by women for whom fertility is a concern. Radiotherapy is rarely used alone; in most cases, it is used in combination with chemotherapy.",Trachelectomy vs. chemoradiotherapy,"Chemoradiotherapy is radiotherapy and chemotherapy used in combination. This treatment method can help to remove the cancer and lessen the chances of it recurring.[8] Radiotherapy is administered in the manner described above, while chemotherapy uses cytotoxic drugs administered intravenously to destroy cancer cells.",Trachelectomy and fertility,"Women who wish to preserve their fertility may opt for a trachelectomy over a hysterectomy. Since the uterus remains intact after a trachelectomy, pregnancy can still occur. Roughly 97 percent of people who have undergone trachelectomy surgery, eventually return to a normal menstrual cycle. However, doctors may advise delaying any attempt to conceive for approximately two years.[9]","Conception may be difficult. The risk of miscarriage among people who have had a trachelectomy is significantly higher than the norm, and any fetus carried to term must be delivered by caesarian section (C-section).",Trachelectomy procedures,"Trachelectomy surgery is carried out in a hospital, under general anesthetic. It may be performed either vaginally or abdominally: vaginal surgery is the most commonly performed method, though abdominal surgery may be more appropriate for people with larger cancerous lesions.[10]","Abdominal trachelectomy may be performed by hand, or be laparoscopic or robotically assisted. Laparoscopic surgery is less painful, with a shorter recovery time and a lower risk of infection, though it also increases the risk of damage to the surrounding organs and the urinary tract. Robotically-assisted trachelectomy takes longer to perform, but has a shorter recovery time, with less potential for blood loss and fewer possible complications. As a trachelectomy is not a common surgical procedure, it is often performed at specialized gynecological centers.[11]",Trachelectomy recovery,"Recovery time and the potential for side-effects depend on the method used in performing the trachelectomy. Most people recover in a hospital at first, and most take medications for pain management and the avoidance of infection or blood clots.","In general, people are advised to get plenty of rest and avoid heavy exertion. They should not have sexual intercourse or place anything in the vagina, such as a tampon. They should also avoid bathing while seated, and avoid excessive strain during a bowel movement. After several weeks – and when they are no longer taking pain medication – they may resume driving a car.","It is important that people avoid taking aspirin while recovering from a trachelectomy, as it may increase the risk of bleeding.[12]","Depending on the type of surgery performed, people will receive different recommendations for taking care of the wound. In all cases, they should inspect the wound regularly for any signs of infection such as redness, separation, swelling or drainage.","After returning home from the hospital, individuals may need another person to assist them with their daily activities. Loose clothes and underwear, as well as sanitary pads for bleeding and discharge may also be advised.","If a person experiences a high fever (above 100.4°F/38°C), excessive bleeding, abdominal or chest pain, foul-smelling vaginal discharge, fainting, or difficulty breathing or urinating, they should contact a doctor.[12] People experiencing any symptoms that may be linked to a trachelectomy can also carry out a symptom assessment using the free Ada app.",Risks and side-effects of trachelectomy,"A trachelectomy is a major surgical procedure that comes with inherent risks. Though it offers a way to preserve a person’s fertility during cervical cancer treatment, pregnancy will have a higher risk of miscarriage and other complications. Other risks or side-effects may include:[12]","
Infection or bleeding
Scar tissue, which may increase the risk of infertility or uterine infection[13]
Blood clotting
Damage to the urinary tract or nearby organs
Hernia or blocked bowel
Difficulty urinating or urinary incontinence

","Women are advised to talk to a doctor about any complications of a trachelectomy they may be experiencing. Additionally, the Ada app can be used to carry out a symptom assessment.",Trachelectomy FAQs,"Q: Is a trachelectomy painful?
A: A trachelectomy is performed under general anesthetic, while a person is unconscious. As a result, the procedure itself will not be painful, but there may be some pain or tenderness around the location of the wound after the procedure, as well as a general feeling of achiness or exhaustion. While still in hospital, pain relief will normally be supplied.[14] Pain during intercourse and a painful menstrual cycle are also possible complications of a trachelectomy. Talk to a doctor if these complications occur.","Q: Is it possible to have a trachelectomy after a hysterectomy?
A: Yes, it is possible to have a trachelectomy after a hysterectomy. This is usually necessary when the retained cervix, sometimes termed the cervical stump, is at risk of symptoms or disease following the initial hysterectomy. It is estimated that new cervical symptoms will arise in around one quarter of women who undergo a hysterectomy.[15]","Q: What is the difference between a simple trachelectomy and a radical trachelectomy?
A: A radical trachelectomy is the most commonly performed type of the procedure, involving the removal of the cervix and a portion of the vagina. A simple trachelectomy, on the other hand, removes only the cervix."

,,,,,,,,,,What is transient ischemic attack?,"A transient ischemic attack (TIA), sometimes called a mini-stroke, is a sudden, short-lived neurological condition. It is caused by a small, temporary blockage in a blood vessel in the brain. The symptoms last less than a hour in most cases, but can last up to 24 hours. Common symptoms include a loss of vision, slurred speech and weakness of the face, arm or legs. Treatment aims to prevent a further TIA and stroke by thinning the blood and managing conditions which increase the risk of having a stroke. Although a TIA itself does not cause permanent damage to the brain, it is a warning sign that a stroke may occur in the near future. People who have had a TIA should discuss steps to prevent strokes with a doctor.",Risks,"A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is caused by a small, temporary blockage in a blood vessel in the brain. This causes a part of the brain to be temporarily without oxygen, causing the symptoms of the TIA. This condition can affect anyone, but is most common in people older than 60 years of age. Some medical conditions, especially high blood pressure, diabetes, atrial fibrillation (an abnormal heart rhythm), or high cholesterol levels, cause an increased risk of developing this condition. People who smoke and people who have a family member who has had a stroke also have an increased risk of having a TIA.",Symptoms,"The symptoms of a transient ischemic attack may be slightly different from person to person, but are always short-lived. The symptoms last less than a hour in most cases, but can last up to 24 hours. They may include a loss of vision, slurred speech or difficulty finding words, and weakness of the face, arm or leg. A temporary change in behavior, memory and movement is also possible.",Diagnosis,"The diagnosis may be made based on a description of the symptoms and a examination of the nervous system. After a TIA, tests may be done to look for factors that increase the risk of a stroke in the near future. This may involve blood tests, an ultrasound scan of the blood vessels in the neck and, possibly, a MRI or CT scan of the head.",Treatment,"The treatment following a transient ischemic attack (TIA) may involve taking medication to thin the blood. Having a TIA increases the risk of further strokes and so the treatment of other medical conditions, especially high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, atrial fibrillation and diabetes, is an important part of the treatment.",Prevention,"Lifestyle changes, such as eating a healthy diet, taking regular exercise, giving up smoking and reducing alcohol intake can all reduce the risk of transient ischemic attack and stroke. Good control of high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels and diabetes can help to prevent a TIA.

,,,,,,,,,,What is trigeminal neuralgia?,"Trigeminal neuralgia is a condition in which a dysfunctional facial nerve causes persistent or recurring facial pain. Women older than 40 years of age are most commonly affected by this condition. The condition is characterized by attacks of sudden, sharp, shooting pain in some parts of the face. It is most commonly one-sided, around the eye, cheek, jaws or the lower parts of the face and triggered by movements like smiling, chewing and more. The diagnosis is mostly made based on the symptoms and physical examination. Treatment involves medication to reduce the pain, and, if applicable, surgery. Although the pain can be difficult to control, many people find relief with a combination of therapies.",Risks,"Trigeminal neuralgia is pain which comes from the trigeminal nerve (neuralgia means 'nerve pain'). The trigeminal nerve carries feeling from the facial skin to the brain, and controls the muscles needed for chewing. In many cases, there is no obvious cause for the pain. Sometimes trigeminal neuralgia occurs as the result of another medical condition, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), or a tumor that is pressing on the nerve. Although anyone can develop trigeminal neuralgia, it is more common in people older than 40. It is more common in women than men.",Symptoms,"The typical symptom is a very strong, sharp and electric pain of the face. This typically comes from the ear and spreads around the eye, and over the cheek, jaw and chin. This pain is usually only present on one side of the face, though it can occur on both sides in some cases. The pain tends to come in short-lived, 'electric shock'-like bursts. Talking, smiling, chewing, light touch on the face, swallowing and kissing can trigger the pain, though some people have pain without any trigger at all. As the pain is located in the jaw, teeth or gums, it can be mistaken for tooth pain.",Diagnosis,"The diagnosis is based on the symptoms and physical examination. Imaging of the head, such as with a CT scan or MRI scan, are usually done to exclude other causes for the pain, like MS or a tumor.",Treatment,"Treatment of trigeminal neuralgia involves treating the underlying cause, if there is one, and managing the pain.

,,,,,,,,,,What is ulcerative colitis (UC)?
,,,,,,,,,,What is ulcerative colitis (UC)?,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is one of the two main forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The other is Crohn’s disease. Ulcerative colitis is a fairly common condition: approximately 907,000 people in the U.S. are believed to be affected.[1]","The term colitis refers specifically to inflammation in the colon, or large intestine. In UC, inflammation occurring in the colon and/or rectum causes small ulcers to develop on the lining of the affected area, which may bleed and produce pus. Over time, the inflammation can permanently damage the mucosal (top) and submucosal (second) layers of intestinal tissue that line the colorectal area. This results in a variety of intestinal symptoms, including diarrhea and cramping. In addition, UC may also lead to problems in other body systems, either as a direct result of intestinal dysfunction, or due to more widespread effects of inflammation.","Ulcerative colitis is a lifelong (chronic) condition which requires regular medical attention. After diagnosis, a person may need to adapt their lifestyle to accommodate their treatment needs, which will vary according to a number of factors, including the individual’s age, the severity of their condition, and any other medical conditions they may have.",Symptoms,"A person who is affected by ulcerative colitis may experience a wide range of possible symptoms, to varying degrees of severity, including:",Intestinal symptoms,"Symptoms which are directly related to one’s intestinal health, such as:","
Diarrhea; possibly featuring blood, mucus or pus
Rectal pain
Abdominal pain and cramping
Urgency to defecate
",Extraintestinal manifestations,Symptoms related to a person’s overall level of health and/or symptoms which affect other areas of the body. Possible extraintestinal manifestations of UC may include:,"
Involuntary weight loss
Loss of appetite
Fatigue
Malnutrition
Inflammation affecting the eyes, skin or joints
","If you think you or a loved one may be showing signs of ulcerative colitis, or are otherwise unwell, you can get a free symptom assessment at any time by downloading the Ada app.",Subtypes of ulcerative colitis,UC almost always begins in the rectum and spreads upwards through the bowel in a continuous fashion. The scope of symptoms depends on what section of the colon the inflammation reaches. For this reason UC can be divided into the following subtypes:[2],Proctitis,"This type of UC only affects the rectum. This is the mildest type of UC, as the colon itself is generally able to function as normal. Symptoms are usually directly related to defecation, including diarrhea, tenesmus (a sensation of urgency without defecation) or, in some cases, constipation. Most people with proctitis will pass blood or blood stained mucus from the rectum.",Proctosigmoiditis,"Inflammation occurs in the rectum as well as the sigmoid colon - the final section of the colon which adjoins the rectum. The symptoms are similar to those of proctitis, although constipation is much less likely. Further health complications are significantly less likely to develop from proctosigmoiditis, compared to cases where a greater intestinal area is affected.[3]",Distal colitis,"Also known as left-sided colitis, distal colitis affects the the left side of the colon, the sigmoid colon and the rectum. This is the most common form of UC, and recent treatment approaches have focused on devising medications that target the distal portion of the colorectal area.[4] Distal colitis can cause pain on the left side of the abdomen, as well as the symptoms listed above.",Pancolitis,"Also known as total colitis or universal colitis, pancolitis affects the entire colorectal area. Symptoms may include severe abdominal pain and cramping, as well as frequent episodes of diarrhea, often accompanied by blood, mucus and pus. Fever, weight loss and other systemic health complications may also be present, as pancolitis can impact the colon’s ability to take in nutrients, compromising a person’s overall health.[5]",Extensive colitis,"This is a form of UC in which the majority of the colon is affected, but not the entire colon; the part of the colon directly adjoining the small intestine is not affected. The symptoms, treatment and outlook for extensive colitis are almost identical to those of pancolitis.",Fulminant colitis (rare),"UC can also be classified according to its severity, with fulminant colitis being one of the rarest and most severe forms. Fulminant colitis usually affects people who have already been diagnosed with another, less severe form of UC.[6] Symptoms include severe pain and cramping, intense and protracted episodes of diarrhea, and bleeding.","Immediate medical attention is needed if fulminant colitis occurs, as life-threatening complications like toxic megacolon can occur if it is left untreated.[7]",Symptoms: flare-ups,"Not everybody will experience all of the possible symptoms of UC. People with ulcerative colitis often find their symptoms vary over time, and that they experience periods of:","
Flare-ups, in which the inflammation is active, new damage occurs to the intestinal tissue and the individual experiences additional symptoms or a worsening of symptoms.
Remission, in which the inflammation is inactive, their intestinal tissue can begin to heal and symptoms may be absent or mild enough not to interfere with day-to-day routine.
","Flare ups can occur despite treatment for UC. The symptoms of a flare-up vary between people, depending on factors like the type and severity of UC, as well as how a person defines a period of remission.","Frequent or prolonged flare-ups of UC may increase one’s likelihood of developing related health complications. People who are in remission are usually advised to contact their healthcare professional if they suspect the beginnings of a flare-up, so that a specific treatment plan can be devised.",In severe flare ups the following additional symptoms may occur:,"
Shortness of breath
Fast or irregular heartbeat
High temperature
",These symptoms require immediate medical assessment.,Causes,"UC is understood to result from an inappropriate immune response, although the exact cause for this response is not fully understood, and is likely to vary between individuals. Factors which may be involved include:","
Genetic predisposition. Ulcerative colitis is more common in people with an affected parent or sibling.
Environmental triggers. Factors such as adverse reactions to one’s diet and/or medications, stress, and living in deprived socioeconomic circumstances are found to precipitate UC.
Infections. Bacterial infections – such as Salmonella and Shigella – may trigger an abnormal immune response in certain genetically-predisposed individuals, causing the immune system to inappropriately attack the lining of the digestive tract.
",Risk factors,"People of any age can be affected by UC, but it usually first manifests in adulthood, with peaks in young adulthood between the ages of 15 and 30, and in older adults between the ages of 50 and 70.[8] Risk factors for developing UC include:[9]","
Being of Caucasian descent; some studies conclude that Ashkenazi Jewish people are particularly at risk
Having immediate family members with the condition
Living in an industrialized country in an urban area with a high concentration of people[10]
","Although some kinds of infectious bacteria can sometimes bring about a flare-up of UC, UC itself is not an infectious condition. It cannot be passed from one person to another via bodily contact.",Additional risk factors include:[11],"Not having had an appendectomy (an operation to remove one’s appendix). UC diagnosis has been found to be slightly less common in people who have previously had their appendix removed due to abdominal inflammation, but appendectomy will not cure UC which is already present. Furthermore, it is not considered to be a preventative measure, because the relationship between the procedure and the condition is not yet sufficiently understood.","Not using tobacco products. Nicotine, a component of tobacco, is believed to have immunosuppressive effects, which seem to reduce one’s likelihood of experiencing the autoimmune overreaction that precipitates UC.","However,using tobacco products is not considered to be a relevant preventative measure against UC and is never medically advisable. This is due to the many other health complications which may be precipitated or worsened by smoking, including Crohn’s disease, the other main form of IBD.",Diagnosis,"For many people, the presence of blood or pus in their stools is an important warning sign of possible UC. It is advisable to seek medical attention promptly if this occurs, to enable early diagnosis if UC is present, and to begin treatment before symptoms worsen or increase in number.","When UC is suspected, the doctor will consider a person’s medical history, including previous episodes of digestive discomfort, their lifestyle, including dietary and environmental factors, and whether they have family members affected by UC.","The initial consultation will also include a physical examination. The doctor will look out for indications of health complications associated with UC, such as malnutrition (as a result of malabsorption), pale complexion (anemia), abdominal tenderness and red, itchy eyes (uveitis).","To make a definitive diagnosis of UC, it is important that the doctor rules out other possible causes for the presenting symptoms. Other conditions that can be associated with rectal bleeding or diarrhea include:[12]","
Crohn’s disease, the other main form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
Other forms of colitis such as ischemic colitis (caused by a loss of blood supply to part of the colon) and infectious colitis (when bacteria cause irritation in the colon)
Lactose intolerance (which occurs when a person cannot digest foods containing lactose, which can cause irritation in the colon)
Hemorrhoids (swollen veins in the rectum)
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
Colorectal cancer
","Diagnostic tests will normally be scheduled in order to rule out other possible causes of a person’s symptoms, to confirm a diagnosis of UC if present, and to establish the type and severity of the condition.",Diagnostic tests for UC include:,Stool sample,"This is carried out to screen for the presence of bacteria, which can help rule out other infectious causes for one’s symptoms, such as gastroenteritis.",Blood tests,"A doctor will usually perform some standard blood tests, as well as some more specialized blood tests, called antibody tests or biomarkers. Standard tests including a person’s complete blood count (CBC) to detect anemia and/or infection, as well as liver function, electrolyte and mineral levels, as these may also be affected by diarrhoea and malabsorption.","Antibody blood tests are sometimes useful to differentiate between UC and Crohn’s disease. These examine proteins called antibodies produced by the immune system, which can indicate the presence of particular diseases.",Read more about Blood Test Results »,Radiography,Imaging techniques may include:[13],"
X-ray. In addition to CT or MRI scanning, a regular X-ray may be taken initially, to look for signs of inflammation/thickening in the bowel wall.
Computed tomography (CT) scanning. An abdominal CT scan is the primary type of imaging used to investigate IBD.

",Read more about undergoing a CT Scan »,Endoscopy and biopsy,"An endoscopy is a procedure which usually involves inserting a thin, flexible tube called an endoscope into the body to examine an area of the gastrointestinal tract. A biopsy (tissue sample taken from the affected area for laboratory analysis) may be taken simultaneously. The specific types of endoscopy which may be used in the diagnosis of UC are:[14][15]","
Sigmoidoscopy. To examine the rectum and final portion of the colon, using a short endoscope, in suspected cases of proctitis or proctosigmoiditis.
Colonoscopy. To examine the entire length of the colon, in suspected cases of distal colitis or pancolitis.
Colon capsule endoscopy (CCE). A new technique which may sometimes be used in the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease, which involves swallowing a small capsule containing a camera which passes through the entire gastrointestinal tract. Its detection of inflammation is not considered to be as extensive as traditional techniques, and it is not possible to take a biopsy using CCE.

Although there is no cure for UC, with appropriate treatment and management it is often possible for a person with UC to experience periods of remission lasting years or decades, and to live a fulfilled, active life. During remission, a person’s symptoms will usually be absent, or mild and easily managed. Treatments for UC may include:",Aminosalicylates (5-ASAs),"Aminosalicylates (also called 5-ASAs) are anti-inflammatory medications which are prescribed as a first-line treatment for UC. They are suitable in cases of mild or moderate UC, and can be taken in the long-term, to maintain remission, or short-term, to calm flare-ups. The dose and method of administration depends on the severity of one’s UC.",Corticosteroid medications,"Corticosteroid medications are a more powerful type of anti-inflammatory medication than aminosalicylates and may be used to treat flare-ups in cases where aminosalicylates have not calmed the symptoms on their own. Corticosteroids are suitable for short-term use and are a commonly prescribed treatment for flare-ups. Long-term use of corticosteroids is associated with problematic side effects including osteoporosis, weight gain and the development of other gastrointestinal disorders.",Immunosuppressant medications,"These medications work by reducing the activity of one’s immune system. In this way, they can serve to alleviate the intestinal inflammation that occurs in people with IBD. They are used to treat mild or moderate flare-ups (often to be administered intravenously under hospital supervision), and to maintain remission in people whose symptoms do not respond to other medications.",Biologic medications,"Biologic therapies are usually prescribed in cases where other treatments have not worked, rather than as a first-line treatment. They are a type of immunosuppressant medication which use naturally occurring substances such as antibodies and enzymes to inhibit the effects of UC.[16]","The most commonly prescribed biologic medications used to treat UC are Infliximab and Adalimumab. These are suitable for both adults and children with moderate to severe UC. They are also called anti-TNF medications because they inhibit a protein called the TNF-alpha, which is found in everybody’s blood as a response to infection.[17]",Surgery,"In cases where medications have not alleviated the symptoms of UC or in cases where a person’s quality of life is severely compromised by their condition, surgery to permanently remove the entire colon may be recommended, with a procedure called a total colectomy. It is carried out as an inpatient procedure under general anesthetic by a colorectal surgeon. This may be performed using open surgery or laparoscopic (minimally invasive) surgery.",The removal of the colon necessitates the installation of an alternative mechanism for waste to leave the body. This may involve:,An ileostomy,"The small intestine will be redirected so that its contents exit the body through a hole made in the abdomen called a stoma. One can attach a colostomy bag to the hole to collect bodily waste. Ileostomies can either be temporary (in which case, an ileo-anal pouch will eventually be created during a subsequent operation), or permanent.",An ileo-anal pouch,"Also known as a J-pouch, this involves creating a pouch inside the body from the tissue of the small intestine. The pouch is connected to the anus and replaces the colon, allowing waste to pass though as normal.",Both the colectomy itself and one’s life afterwards present challenges for an individual to adapt to. Some people may therefore prefer to manage their UC with non-surgical treatments.,Living with UC,People living with UC may find it helpful to:[18],"
Establish a good relationship with their medical care team
Let their loved ones and colleagues know as much as necessary about their condition so as to prepare for times when they are incapacitated or unavailable due to a flare-up
Receive counseling or therapy to treat any anxiety and stress engendered by UC
Ensure access to sufficient supplies of medications at all times
Find out the location of nearby restrooms in all locations they will visit during the course of a day
",Diet,"There is no recommended diet for people with UC. However, individuals may find that certain foods trigger the symptoms of UC.",Many people with UC find it helpful to:,"
Avoid substances which induce bowel movements, such as spices, caffeine, alcohol and laxative fruits
Experiment with low-residue foods, such as cooked, peeled vegetables, white bread and lean meat (this can reduce the size and frequency of one’s stools)
Drink plenty of fluids to avoid the dehydration which is often caused by diarrhoea
Keep a food diary to record items which may have precipitated an adverse digestive reaction
Take food supplements such as vitamins and minerals to replace those lost due to diarrhea and/or malabsorption
Eat multiple small meals per day, as opposed to a few large ones, in order to avoid putting too much pressure on the gastrointestinal system
","It is advisable to discuss one’s diet with the doctor during the initial consultation about UC and again before making significant changes to it. The doctor will be able to advise on the most sensible diet plan for an individual’s profile and condition, taking their treatment plan into account.",Complications of ulcerative colitis,"In addition to experiencing the symptoms of ulcerative colitis, people with UC are predisposed to develop a number of further health complications. However, by diagnosing and beginning to treat UC promptly one can decrease the likelihood of developing any complications. Possible complications of UC include:[1][19][20][21][22][23]","
Fistula. An abnormal passage between the bowel and surrounding structures.
Gastrointestinal perforation. A life-threatening complication, in which a hole develops in the wall of the gastrointestinal tract. The earliest symptom of this is usually severe pain which worsens with movement. .
Stricture. The narrowing of part of the colon or rectum. Surgery may be needed to remove the affected part of the colon.
Toxic megacolon. A rare complication in which the colon expands and dilates, often due to bacterial infection. This can result in the rupturing of the colon.
Colorectal cancer (CC). People with UC are at higher risk of contracting CC. It is recommended that they undergo regular screening.

A: It is possible for people with UC to have an uncomplicated conception and pregnancy and a healthy baby. However, doctors recommend conceiving at a time when neither partner is experiencing a flare-up of UC.[25] Problems associated with conception during a flare-up of UC may include:","
An increased likelihood of having active UC during pregnancy, in comparison to women who become pregnant during a period of remission
In turn, in those affected by flare-ups of UC during pregnancy, there are heightened risks of pregnancy complications such as preterm birth or low birth weight, and adverse pregnancy outcomes such as miscarriage
","However, it is possible to conceive during a flare-up and/or experience a flare-up during pregnancy and still give birth to a healthy baby.[25] Many medications for UC can be safely taken during pregnancy and whilst breastfeeding. A specialist doctor will advise on appropriate management of UC during pregnancy.",Find out more about Pregnancy Complications »
,,,,,,,,,,What is unstable angina pectoris?
,,,,,,,,,,What is unstable angina pectoris?,"Unstable angina, also known as unstable angina pectoris, is a medical emergency with sudden chest pain or tightness that worsens over a short period of time. Although it is not a heart attack, the symptoms are very similar, and is a warning that a person may have a heart attack in the near future. The symptoms are usually not predictable and often do not improve with rest. It occurs when the flow of blood and oxygen to the heart is reduced. Hardening and narrowing of the heart blood vessels due to atherosclerosis is the most common cause of stable angina. It is more common in older adults, smokers, and people with high blood pressure or high blood cholesterol levels. Treatment involves short term treatments to reduce pain and relax the blood vessels of the heart, and long-term medications and lifestyle changes to reduce the chance of having a heart attack in the future. With good management, many people learn to manage their symptoms. However, without treatment, the underlying cause may get worse and eventually cause a heart attack.",Risks,"Angina occurs when the heart is temporarily not getting enough oxygen. This occurs when narrowing of the blood vessels of the heart make it difficult for the heart to get extra blood when it needs to work harder (for example, when doing exercise). Unstable angina occurs when the vessels become very narrow. This condition is similar to a heart attack, and is a warning sign that a person may have a heart attack in the future. The most common cause is atherosclerosis, which is the narrowing and formation of collections in blood vessels over time. Older people and people with medical conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and high blood cholesterol are more likely to have this condition. Smoking also increases the risk of developing angina.",Symptoms,"The typical symptom of angina is a chest pressure or pain that radiates to the left arm, back, jaw or neck. There may also be sweating, shortness of breath and nausea and vomiting. The symptoms of unstable angina often come on quickly, and may have no predictable trigger. Some people experience symptoms while resting. Some people find that using GTN spray or tablets (glyceryl trinitrate) don't help to improve their symptoms.",Diagnosis,"Diagnosis is usually made based on the symptoms, a physical examination and an electrocardiogram (ECG). The best test to look for blockages in the blood vessels is coronary angiography. This involves injecting dye into the blood vessels of the heart and taking X-rays to see any blockages. A blood test will be done to exclude heart attack. Other tests may include an ultrasound of the heart (echocardiography), cholesterol levels and blood sugar levels.",Treatment,"Treatment of unstable angina involves short-term measures to reduce pain and long-term measures to reduce the risk of a heart attack. People with chest pain should take GTN (spray, tablet or capsule) under the tongue. If the pain continues or gets worse, the person needs to urgently go to the emergency department. If there are warning signs that a person is at very high risk of a heart attack, emergency angiography could be needed, and a stent (a small wire tube) can be placed to open up any blockages in the blood vessels. Long-term treatment for unstable angina often involves medications to thin the blood, to control blood pressure and to reduce cholesterol levels. An exercise program (cardiac rehabilitation) may be helpful to improve heart function. Eventually, a procedure to open the narrowed heart blood vessels with a stent, or even bypass surgery may be needed to prevent a heart attack.",Prevention,"Eating a healthy diet, regular exercise, maintaining a healthy weight and giving up smoking can help to prevent developing blockages in the blood vessels of the heart. Cholesterol levels, blood pressure and blood sugar should be well controlled in order to prevent this condition."
,,,,,,,,,,What is an upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage?
,,,,,,,,,,What is an upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage?,"Upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage is a medical condition in which heavy bleeding occurs in the upper parts of the digestive tract: the esophagus (tube between the mouth and stomach), the stomach or the small intestine. This is often a medical emergency. It occurs when the lining of these organs is damaged, for example by ulcers, tears, or if a blood vessel becomes weak and bursts. This condition is more common in elderly people and people with other medical conditions, such as liver conditions or blood clotting disorders. The symptoms might differ depending on the cause of the bleeding but often include vomiting blood and passing dark tarry stools. An endoscopy (camera through the mouth to look at the esophagus, stomach and small intestine) is done to confirm the diagnosis and stop the cause of the bleeding. Treatment involves replacing fluids and blood loss and controlling the bleeding. This condition can be prevented by treating the condition causing the bleed. The outcome after an upper gastrointestinal bleed depends on the amount of blood loss, and whether the bleeding can be controlled.",Risks,"Upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage is heavy bleeding from the esophagus, the stomach or the upper part of the small intestine. There are many conditions which can cause damage to the lining of these organs and cause bleeding. The most common are stomach ulcers, gastritis (inflammation of the stomach), weakness and increased pressure in the blood vessels of the esophagus, and tears in the linings of esophagus or stomach caused by vomiting. Less common causes are a cancer in the area and the overuse of anti-inflammatory medications. It is more common in elderly people and people who have liver cirrhosis (scarring) or kidney disease. People who take medications to thin the blood, or who have problems with blood clotting, may also have an increased risk of developing this condition.",Symptoms,"Common symptoms include vomiting blood or vomit which has a coffee-ground appearance. Some people may pass dark, tarry bowel motions. Additional symptoms depend on the amount of blood lost and may include bright red bowel motions, a loss of energy, paleness, fast pulse, dizziness, confusion or even loss of consciousness. Symptoms of the condition causing the bleeding may also be present.",Diagnosis,"Diagnosis is based on the symptoms, the physical examination and endoscopy (a camera through the mouth to look at the esophagus, stomach and small intestine).",Treatment,"The most important steps in treatment are to stabilize people who have symptoms due to severe blood loss and to find and stop the bleeding as soon as possible. This often includes blood transfusions, fluids and medicines through a drip (intravenously) to control blood pressure and replace lost blood. The bleeding can often be stopped through endoscopic methods. If that is not successful, surgery might be needed. Treatment of the underlying illness is necessary after the person is medically stable.",Prevention,"Preventing bleeds from the esophagus, stomach and small intestine involves treating and preventing the diseases that may cause it. This may include reducing alcohol intake to prevent liver disease, giving up smoking, and avoiding long-term use of anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen, which can cause stomach ulcers. People with stomach ulcers should be treated for Helicobacter pylori, the bacteria which causes this condition. People with this condition should discuss the risk bleeding with a doctor before beginning blood-thinning medications.",Other names for upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage,"

,,,,,,,,,,What is urinary incontinence (UI)?
,,,,,,,,,,What is urinary incontinence (UI)?,"A person who is affected by urinary incontinence (UI), loses control of their urinary sphincter, the two muscles which control the passage of urine into the bladder, resulting in an involuntary leakage of urine.","UI is a symptom of other conditions, rather than a medical condition in its own right. People develop UI for a variety of reasons. It is generally associated with conditions which affect people in later life, such as prostate problems in men and the menopause in women.","Normal urinary function is controlled by the brain, which sends signals to the muscles that control the urine flow, in particular the pelvic floor muscles. Urine is produced by the kidneys. It contains the waste products from the body — including toxins, salts and water — that collect in the blood. Urine travels from the kidneys via the ureters (these are the connecting tubes between the kidneys and the bladder) to the bladder where it is stored until urination. In people with UI, the brain’s process of sending a signal to the bladder to release the urine can become compromised.",This causes a person to be mentally unprepared for a sudden leakage of urine. The muscles in the bladder may also lose their functionality. This renders the bladder physically unprepared to contract and relax as needed in order to store urine effectively.,"People affected by UI often experience a poorer quality of life than continent people. This is because the condition usually impacts significantly upon an individual’s daily routine. In severe cases, UI can necessitate taking time off work and may cause physical sexual dysfunction due to an inability to control the timing of urination — as well as inspiring feelings of embarrassment and distress.[1]","However, in most cases, UI can be alleviated with correct management and/or treatment methods. Treatments include learning behavioral techniques and following an exercise program to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles, called Kegel exercises. In cases where an initial treatment plan does not alleviate UI, supplementary surgery may be considered. Alternatively, a long-term strategy for minimising the day-to-day impact of UI can be devised.",Symptoms,"People affected by urinary incontinence (UI), experience loss of control over their urinary system. This can result in many different kinds of difficulties related to urinating, ranging from involuntary leakage to becoming unable to fully empty the bladder during urination.","UI can be transient:[2] a short-term or temporary problem which clears up on its own after the underlying cause, for example, a urinary tract infection, is resolved. However, UI can persist indefinitely.","Ongoing cases of UI are described as chronic[2] and can be the result of long-term conditions which affect the production of urine and/or the urinary system, such as diabetes. Chronic UI can last indefinitely if left untreated, so it is important for anyone affected by UI to seek medical guidance.","The most common types of UI are stress incontinence, i.e.placing stress on the bladder during involuntary physical activities, such as sneezing or laughing causes an involuntary release of urine, and urge incontinence, which is a sudden and uncontrollable need to urinate. If you think that you or a loved one may be affected by urinary incontinence, you can get a free symptom assessment by downloading the Ada app.",There are six types of urinary incontinence:,"
Transient urinary incontinence. This is temporary, and directly related to a short-term condition being experienced by the affected person.
Stress urinary incontinence. This type of UI is due to pressure on the bladder from physical activity, such as sneezing or coughing.
Urge urinary incontinence. This involves a sudden and intense need to urinate due to an overactive bladder.
Chronic urinary retention. This results in feelings of having failed to fully empty the bladder after urination. This is also called overflow incontinence.
Functional urinary incontinence. This relates to an inability to urinate due to physical and mental obstacles.
Mixed urinary incontinence. This is when a person experiences two or more types of incontinence in combination. Stress and urge incontinence are the kinds of UI which are most commonly experienced together.
",Transient urinary incontinence,"Transient, short-term urinary incontinence can be caused by easily treatable factors, such as an adverse reaction to medication, and will clear up when the causal problem is remedied. In the first instance, when a person presents with UI, the doctor will determine whether the individual is affected by short-term UI and will then seek to treat the cause or causes.","In a case where UI is caused by an adverse reaction to medication, for example, this would involve stopping using the medication in question and prescribing a replacement option which is not associated with causing UI. Doctors often use a mnemonic — DIAPERS[3] — to explore the possible causes of transient UI and rule out a diagnosis.",Transient UI may be triggered by:,"
Delirium
Infection
Atrophy (when the pelvic floor muscles weaken due to underuse)
Pharmaceuticals
Excess urine output
Restricted mobility
Stool impaction
","A person can be affected by several causes of transient UI simultaneously. In cases where UI may be caused by multiple factors, treating all the causes will maximise the chances of alleviating the UI. Pharmaceuticals which can cause UI principally do so by relaxing the bladder, increasing fluid retention, or inhibiting bladder contractions.[4] Medications which are often associated with the condition include anti-hypersensitives, pain relievers, psychotherapeutics (muscle relaxants) and others, such as antihistamine.","If none of the causes specified in the DIAPERS mnemonic are present, the doctor will begin to investigate other causes of UI, dependent on the specific symptoms of the individual.[2]",Stress urinary incontinence,"Stress urinary incontinence is one of the two most common types of UI — the other being urge urinary incontinence. Stress incontinence is not related to feeling stressed. It occurs when the urethral sphincter, the pelvic muscles that support the bladder and control the progress of urine into the urethra, weakens. The urethral sphincter ceases to function to prevent the flow of urine into the bladder and when the bladder is put under sudden pressure, this results in involuntary leakages of urine.",Activities which may cause leakage of urine with stress incontinence include:,"
Coughing
Sneezing
Laughing
Exercise
Heavy lifting
","People with stress incontinence usually experience small amounts of urinary leakage at intervals over the course of the day. More rarely, the condition can cause a person to involuntarily empty their bladder entirely.",Urge urinary incontinence (overactive bladder syndrome),"Urge urinary incontinence (overactive bladder syndrome) is one of the two most common types of UI — the other being stress urinary incontinence. Urge incontinence is also sometimes called urgency incontinence because it involves a sudden need to relieve the bladder, causing the affected person to release urine a few seconds after they feel the need to do so. Urge incontinence can be triggered by both physical and psychological factors.",Activities and actions which cause leakage of urine with urge incontinence include:,"
Sexual intercourse
Reaching orgasm
A rapid or sudden change of position
Hearing the sound of running water
","People affected by urge incontinence may experience urinary leakage very frequently, and typically wake up several times during the course of the night to pass urine. It is not often possible for the doctor to identify a specific cause of urge incontinence, but it primarily affects women and the elderly.",Chronic urinary retention (overflow incontinence),People affected by chronic urinary retention (overflow incontinence) cannot empty the bladder completely when they pass urine.,Chronic urinary retention can be the result of:,"
A mechanical obstruction, for example a urethral stricture (narrowing of the urethra caused by injury, infection or disturbance to the area from devices such as a catheter).
A dynamic obstruction, such as a loss of muscle tone, or by a combination of these factors. The condition can also be caused by the failure of the nervous system to transmit signals to the bladder.
","People with chronic urinary retention are usually unaware that they are affected, until they develop a further symptom, such as a urinary tract infection (UTI) or lose their bladder control, resulting in an involuntary leakage of urine.","Good to know: Rather than experiencing chronic, long-term urinary retention, a person can experience acute urinary retention, a short-term form of UI in which it becomes impossible to empty their bladder at all, even when it is full.[5] Acute urinary retention can be painful and potentially life-threatening, so it is vital to seek urgent medical attention.",Functional urinary incontinence,People experiencing functional urinary incontinence usually become aware that they need to urinate in advance of voiding their bladder. Their involuntary leakage of urine is caused by a range of possible physical and mental factors which prevent them from accessing the appropriate facilities in time.,Factors which contribute to functional urinary incontinence can include:,"
Dementia
Impaired dexterity
Confusion
Alzheimer’s disease
Parkinson’s disease
Depression
Anxiety
Poor eyesight (this may reduce a person’s ability to find their way to the restroom)
","Functional urinary incontinence primarily affects the elderly, and people suffering from impaired mobility. It can involve either emptying the bladder fully or passing small amounts of involuntary urinary leakage.",Mixed incontinence,"It is possible for a person to experience several types of UI simultaneously; this is called mixed incontinence. The most commonly experienced form of mixed incontinence involves being affected by both stress incontinence (leaking urine with activity) and urge incontinence (the sudden, uncontrollable urge to pass urine).",It is possible to manage and/or treat mixed incontinence with a treatment plan which addresses the triggers of all the types of UI present.,Causes of urinary incontinence,"UI is a common problem which affects more females than males. UI most commonly affects elderly people because it is associated with many conditions that typically develop in later life, such as Parkinson’s disease and dementia.",UI may develop as a result of any of the following factors:,"
Another condition affecting the individual, for example, benign prostate hyperplasia
A number of different biological processes, for example pregnancy and the ageing of a person’s connective tissue, which can be influenced by their genetics and gender
A side-effect of medication
A complication relating to a surgical procedure
",Conditions and procedures which are commonly associated with urinary incontinence include:,"
Urinary tract infections, which may be intermittent or chronic
Congenital or birth defects — problems with development of the urinary tract
Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) — an enlarged prostate gland
Kidney failure
Vaginal prolapse
Injuries to the spinal and nervous system
Injuries to the pelvic area
Stroke
Diabetes
High blood pressure
Smoking tobacco
Alcohol abuse
Obesity
Interstitial cystitis (bladder pain syndrome)
Pregnancy: risk of UI increases with each pregnancy a person experiences
Prostatectomy (prostate surgery)
Menopause and postmenopausal complications
","Because of the differences between the sexes in terms of pelvic and genital structure and the way the genitalia are connected to the urinary system, UI generally affects females and males differently in terms of the type of UI experienced, and for different reasons. Females are often affected by UI in relation to their reproductive processes, whereas males commonly experience UI in relation to problems affecting the prostate gland and associated surgery.",Causes of UI in women,"Women are more likely to experience UI than men because they are, physiologically, more likely to undergo bodily changes which compromise the normal function of the urinary system. Women can be affected by all types of UI and at any age. However, UI in women is primarily associated with ageing and with natural biological processes.For example, UI often accompanies pregnancy and also commonly affects women during or after they experience the stages of menopause.",The principal types of UI experienced by women are:,"
Stress incontinence
Urgency incontinence
Mixed incontinence
","People who have experienced pregnancy are more likely to experience UI. This is because being pregnant always involves changes to a person’s hormonal levels and an increase of pressure on their pelvic floor muscles as the developing fetus grows, which is likely to disrupt urinary function during the pregnancy as well as afterwards.","Giving birth itself, particularly vaginally, can alter the position of the pelvic floor muscles that control the flow of urine from the bladder, further increasing the chances of developing UI after being pregnant. However, the hormonal changes and stress to the pelvic floor involved in pregnancy, are the primary causes of UI in women, rather than the actions involved in birth itself. Therefore, opting for a c-section will not significantly reduce a person’s likelihood of developing UI. If you are concerned that you or a loved one may be developing UI, get a free symptom assessment with the Ada app.","The risk of UI increases with the number of times a person experiences pregnancy and childbirth. Both cesarean (c-section) and vaginal birthing methods can give rise to UI. Many people experience UI whilst going through the menopause, which involves a reduction in their accustomed estrogen levels. However, it is not thought possible to alleviate UI with any significant success by taking oral estrogen supplements; these can in fact worsen the condition.[6]",Causes of UI in men,"Men can experience any of the types of UI. UI primarily occurs in males because of developing problems with nerve function, such that the brain no longer sends signals to the bladder effectively. This can include suffering from a stroke or a spinal cord injury (SCI), both of which affect the nervous system, interrupting the transmission of the nerve signals required for control of the urinary sphincter. Those who are affected by problems related to the prostate gland are also at risk of experiencing UI.","The prostate gland is located beneath the bladder, inside the male body, between the bladder and the penis and produces about 30% of the body’s ejaculation fluid. Problems which affect the prostate and may be associated with UI, include:","
Benign prostatic hyperplasia
Prostate cancer
Prostatitis (swelling of the prostate gland)
","Read more about Bacterial Prostatitis »
Read more about Nonbacterial Prostatitis »","All of these conditions can change the position of the urinary sphincter and/or exert pressure on the bladder, causing UI.","Prostate problems and associated cases of UI most commonly develop in later life. People who have undergone treatment, such as radiation therapy for prostate cancer, or who have undergone a prostatectomy (prostate surgery) will experience urinary incontinence initially. This usually occurs after the urinary catheter, which facilitates urinary function in the initial postoperative period, is removed. UI associated with prostate surgery generally goes away with correct management and/or treatment, as the recovery period progresses.","For more information about the prostate and conditions that affect it, see this resource on enlarged prostate.",Diagnosis,"Several cross-sectional and/or population-based studies[7][8][9] have been undertaken to investigate a tendency for people, and females in particular, to refrain from seeking medical attention for UI until such point as the urinary leakage poses a serious imposition to their daily routine.","A reason which is commonly given for avoiding consulting a healthcare professional, is the perception that UI is a minor problem which one can tolerate.[10] However, it is important to seek medical attention, as UI develops into a long-term condition which does not alleviate without medical management or treatment in most cases.","Good to know: Many people are first diagnosed with UI after visiting a gynecologist, a doctor who specialises in the female reproductive system. Gynecologists are trained to look out for all potential cases of UI and understand that women may not mention or know that they could be affected by UI. Due to the fact that UI is often diagnosed by gynecologists first, there is a significant overlap between doctors who specialise in gynecology and urology (treating problems with the urinary system).",Diagnostic process,"To diagnose UI, a doctor will review a person’s medical history, carry out urinalysis; an analysis of the composition of the person’s urine; and urodynamic testing; tests which ascertain the function of the individual’s urinary system. Doctors who specialise in problems related to the urinary system are called urologists.","Urodynamic testing involves filling and then emptying the bladder. Pressure readings are taken from the stomach and bladder throughout the process. The aim of urodynamic testing is to replicate the person’s urination process, allowing the doctor to assess any problems and determine their possible causes.","To establish which type or types of UI a person may be experiencing, a doctor will ask about:","
The timeframe in which difficulties urinating have been experienced
Any triggering factors, such as sexual activity, coughing and sneezing, exercise, hearing running water
The typical length of time between feelings of urgency, the sudden need to urinate, and actual urination
Whether the urine loss is intermittent or constant
The volume of urinary leakage
Whether the person has experienced urinary tract infections (UTIs)
","There are many factors which may trigger or worsen UI in a person. Knowledge of a person’s full medical history will help a doctor to determine the type or types of UI which are affecting an individual and the best treatment plan. The doctor will also establish whether a person is using any prescription and/or over-the-counter medications, as these can cause or aggravate UI.",Treatment and management,"UI can be treated or managed successfully with a variety of methods, including:","
Absorbent products
Physical exercise programs, such as kegel exercises
Behavioral treatment
Medications
Non-surgical procedures, such as electrical nerve stimulation
Weight loss (for the obese)
Surgery, i.e. procedures to restore the correct function of the urinary system
","The type of treatment and management techniques required to treat UI will depend on the type and its severity. Often, successful treatment of UI will involve a combination of methods. For example, treatment for stress incontinence may require medication, Kegel exercises and/or behavioural change therapy. In the event that these methods are not sufficient to alleviate the UI, surgery may be considered.",Absorbent products,"There is a great variety of absorbent products for people with UI, including pads, panty-liners and adult diapers. These are mostly used to soak up involuntary leakages of urine on a temporary basis while planning further treatment for UI. Doctors will be able to recommend appropriate products for each person.","Physical exercise programs, such as kegel exercises","Kegel exercises, which target the main muscles involved in the urinary system are particularly helpful for strengthening the pelvic floor muscles. Doctors will advise on an exercise program. Other techniques which may be recommended to manage or prevent UI include pilates and kyphosis exercises.",Behavioral treatment,"Making various changes to a person’s diet and lifestyle and teaching them specific psychological coping techniques related to managing UI, has been found to reduce instances of involuntary urine leakage. Relaxation and breathing techniques, increasing exercise and avoiding drinking excess caffeine and alcohol are particularly helpful.",Medications,"There are several different types of medication which may be used to treat UI, including:","
Hormonal medications for females which help tone the vaginal and urethral muscle tissue
Medications which work by relaxing the muscles in the bladder to increase its capacity
Medications to target the neurotransmitters in the brain to help block involuntary muscle movements that lead to urinary incontinence
",The type of medication which a person is prescribed will depend on factors like their gender and the type and severity of their condition.,Non-surgical procedures,"There are several procedures which can strengthen, rejuvenate and reposition some of the muscles in the urinary system, with the goal of improving bladder control and alleviating the symptoms of UI. This includes injecting bulking agents into the urethral wall to strengthen the urethra or electrically stimulating the muscles. These methods have a lower long-term efficacy rate than surgical treatments, but may be preferable for those unwilling to undergo surgery.",Weight loss,"In obese people, losing weight can be an effective way to reduce the impact of UI and should be considered before surgery as part of an initial treatment plan. Losing five to ten percent of one’s body weight can have a similar effect to other non-surgical treatments for alleviating UI in obese people.[11]",Surgery,"Surgery is very rarely considered as a first line treatment for UI. It is considered in cases where non-invasive methods such as Kegel exercises, behavioral therapies and/or medications and interventional therapies have been prescribed with negligible results.","Most surgery for UI is designed to treat stress incontinence. Most of the surgical procedures for UI have the same goal, bringing the bladder back to its original position. For this reason, surgery for UI is especially performed for treating the condition in women, who are most often affected by UI resulting from factors like hormonal changes, pregnancy and the anatomy of the pelvis changing with age. All of these can cause UI by damaging the pelvic floor in a way which causes the bladder to sink and leave its original position.","There are several types of surgical procedure for UI, most of which are carried out under general or regional anesthetic as in-patient procedures by surgeons called urologists,who specialise in problems related to the urinary system. The appropriate kind of surgery will be decided by the doctor on a case-by-case basis. The types of surgery with the best success rates are the sling procedure and bladder neck suspension surgery.",Prevention,"Although UI is a symptom of other conditions and/or physical states which exert pressure on the bladder, such as pregnancy, which it may not be possible to avoid, it is possible to minimise the risk of experiencing UI by taking measures to reduce the frequency and acidity of your urination and to exercise your pelvic floor muscles.",Methods which contribute to the prevention of UI include:,"
Regular exercise
Avoiding spicy and acidic foods
Avoiding caffeine and alcohol
Eating high-fibre foods to avoid constipation
Maintaining a healthy body weight
Kegel exercises to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles
",Read more about » Treatment and Management of UI,Urinary incontinence FAQs,"Q: Does urinary incontinence affect children?
A: Cases of UI in children are rare. UI most commonly develops in later life, as a result of physical states, such as pregnancy, and conditions, such as dementia, which affect elderly people. In childhood, boys are more prone to nocturnal enuresis (bedwetting) than girls, as they develop bladder control at a later age. Most children develop bladder control by the age of three.[12]","UI in children above the age of three is usually the symptom of another condition such as kidney problems or a UTI. An isolated instance of UI is not a cause for concern. However, if a child has UI regularly or for a prolonged period of time, it is important to seek a medical opinion and to diagnose and treat any related conditions the UI may pertain to.","Q: How does constipation / fecal incontinence affect UI?
A: Fecal impaction is caused by constipation. When feces builds up in the rectum, it can become packed in so tightly that it is impossible to pass the stool. The blockage puts pressure on the surrounding tissues, including the pelvic muscles related to the bladder and urinary system. This pressure can impede the bladder’s normal function, causing UI. Treating the constipation and removing the blockage will allow the urinary system to resume normal function."
,,,,,,,,,,What is urinary incontinence?
,,,,,,,,,,What is urinary incontinence?,"A person who is affected by urinary incontinence (UI) loses control of their urinary sphincter — made up of the two muscles, which control the passage of urine into the bladder — causing involuntary leakage of urine. UI is a symptom of other conditions rather than a medical condition in its own right. People develop UI for a variety of reasons. It is often associated with conditions which affect older people, such as prostate problems in males and menopause in females.","Normal urinary function is controlled by the brain, which sends signals to the muscles in the bladder to hold or release urine, in particular the pelvic floor muscles.

It is transported from the kidneys and excreted (expelled) from the body via the urinary system. Urine travels from the kidneys via the ureters - connecting tubes between the kidneys and the bladder - to the bladder, where it is stored until urination.",There are two principal circumstances which lead to a person developing UI:,"
The brain’s process of sending a signal to the bladder to release the urine can become compromised. This results in a person having limited control over the muscles in their urinary system.
Alternatively, a local muscle fragility can cause UI. If the functionality of all, or part(s), of the muscles in the urinary system is compromised, the bladder may become unable to contract and relax as needed in order to store and release urine effectively, resulting in UI.

The bladder, which holds the urine
The pubococcygeus which supports the bladder and rectum
The sphincter, which helps open and close the urethra
","Kegel exercises should be practiced as directed by a doctor in order to keep the pelvic floor muscles, which control the bladder and urine flow, operational. The movements generally involve tightening and relaxing the vaginal and rectal muscles.","It can take three to six weeks to feel the benefits of starting a program of Kegel exercises, with daily practice. After starting a program, it is advisable to demonstrate how one performs one’s exercises to a doctor or nurse during a check-up to ensure that the proper forms of the Kegel movements are being practiced.",Other forms of exercise which may be helpful in the treatment and prevention of UI include:,Pilates,"Pilates is a form of exercise which can target specific areas of the body in order to improve physical strength and flexibility. Apparatus, like resistance bands and balls are often used in order to help ensure that the correct area of the body is being targeted during the routine.","When performing pilates to improve the pelvic floor muscles, a small pilates ball is often placed between the knees or thighs to ensure the attention is focused on the muscles in this area. Some people find it helpful to join a specialized pilates class, but it is also possible to practice the routines that help lessen UI using equipment at home.",Kyphosis exercises,"Exercises that are designed to prevent an excessive curve of the lumbar region or mid-back, also called kyphosis or a dowager’s hump, have proven beneficial for alleviating the symptoms of UI in both women and men.","These exercises improve posture, which can relieve pressure on the urinary system and also strengthen the pelvic floor muscles. Exercises which involve squatting or stretching the mid-back over a foam roller are particularly helpful.",Behavioral treatment,"Behavioral treatment can be particularly helpful in treating urge and/or stress incontinence and can be prescribed on its own or in combination with other options, such as medication and/or surgery. Behavioral treatment involves learning psychological techniques which can help prevent involuntary urinary leakage. It has been found to be significantly more effective than oral medication alone in overcoming UI.[1]","Behavioral techniques which can be helpful in the management of UI principally involve bladder training. The affected person will learn techniques aimed at emptying the bladder completely and lengthening the intervals between toilet trips. The training also involves scheduling toilet trips, rather than waiting until one feels a sense of urgency.",Other behavioral techniques include:,"
Relaxation exercises
Breathing exercises
Limiting liquid intake before bed to avoid wetting the bed or waking up recurrently during the night. This needs to be discussed in detail with a doctor to ensure that dehydration does not occur.
Avoiding alcohol
Avoiding caffeine
Avoiding acidic foods
Increasing exercise
",Non-surgical procedures,"There are several minimally invasive non-surgical treatments, such as stimulating the muscles in the bladder with electricity using a probe inserted into the vagina, or inserting bulking agents into the urethral wall. This means they are considered preferable to surgical treatments by some patients.","These techniques have a lower long-term efficacy rate than surgical methods. However, for people who are unable or unwilling to undergo surgery and for whom medications and/or behavioral therapies have not successfully treated UI, these options can provide a helpful alternative.",Interventional procedures for UI can involve:[2][3][4][5],"Bulking agents. Substances designed to provide structural reinforcement will be injected into the urethral wall in order to strengthen the urethra. This can help a person regain control of the operation of their urinary sphincter and their ability to hold urine in the bladder. Bulking agents are usually composed of synthetic materials, silicone particles or collagen.",Electrical nerve stimulation (ES). This treatment involves inserting a probe into the vagina and/or anus to deliver electrical stimulation to the muscles in the urinary system in order to strengthen them. ES is mostly prescribed for women with UI and has not been found to be as effective for men.,"Laser treatment. This is a fairly new treatment for UI. It makes use of an erbium‐doped yttrium‐aluminum‐garnet (Er:YAG) laser, which has previously been used successfully in the field of plastic skin reconstruction. This technique has principally been used to treat UI in women. The Er:YAG laser is applied to the supportive tissues in the pelvic area to tighten them. This has been found to be an effective treatment for stress urinary incontinence only, with effects lasting up to one year. Laser treatment for UI has not been found effective for other types of urinary incontinence.","Botox. It is possible to strengthen and rejuvenate the muscles in the urinary system with the use of botox injections (intradetrusor botulinum toxin). Although this is not a first-line treatment for UI, it may be prescribed as an alternative if a person with urge incontinence does not find relief using oral medication.",Medications,This list includes the principal medications which are used in the treatment of UI:,Alpha blockers,These medications are usually prescribed specifically for men who are affected by overflow incontinence. They function to relax the muscles in the neck of the bladder and the muscle fibers in the prostate. This makes it easier to empty the bladder.,Anticholinergic drugs (muscarinic antagonists),"These medications target neurotransmitters, which send signals from the brain to the body, and function to block involuntary muscle movements. In people with UI, this can serve to calm an overactive bladder. Anticholinergics may be especially helpful in treating urge incontinence.",Topical estrogen,"Women who are affected by urge incontinence may benefit from toning the tissues in the vaginal and urethral areas. Vaginal creams, rings or patches containing low-dose, topical estrogen can be helpful for this purpose. Taking the hormone orally, however, can worsen UI and is not recommended.",Beta-3 adrenergic agonists,"These medications are primarily prescribed to treat urge incontinence. They work by relaxing the muscles in the bladder, which increases its capacity. In some cases, they can also help a person to empty their bladder increasingly effectively during urination.",Surgical treatment options,"Surgery is very rarely considered as a first-line treatment for UI. It is typically only considered in cases where non-invasive methods such as Kegel exercises, behavioral therapies and/or medications and interventional therapies have been prescribed and have not been effective, or when other therapies would not be useful in targeting the underlying cause of UI.","Most surgery for UI is designed to treat stress incontinence. Most of the surgical procedures for UI have the same goal, which is bringing the bladder back to its original position.","For this reason, surgery for UI is mainly performed on women. Women are most often affected by UI that results from factors like hormonal changes, pregnancy and the anatomy of the pelvis changing with age. All of these factors are likely to damage the pelvic floor in a way which causes the bladder to sink and leave its original position.","There are several types of surgical procedure that can be performed to treat UI, most of which are carried out under general or local anesthetic as in-patient procedures by surgeons called urologists and who specialize in problems related to the urinary system. In cases when surgery for UI is to be performed on a woman, the urologist will work closely with a gynecologist.",The appropriate kind of surgery will be decided by the doctor on a case-by-case basis. The types of surgery with the best success rates are the sling procedure and bladder neck suspension surgery.,Sling procedure,This procedure is primarily carried out on women as a treatment for stress incontinence.,"A mesh product called a urinary sling is inserted into the pelvic area to restore the urethra to its correct position and full functionality. One advantage of the sling procedure is that it can be performed under local or local anesthetic, although general anaesthetic will be required in some cases, depending on the extent to which the urethra has moved from its correct position.","During the procedure, a small incision will be made in the pelvic area, usually in the abdomen, where the pelvic area meets the top of the thigh or the vagina. The urinary sling will be inserted. The urinary sling works by providing support to the urethra, which it restores to its correct position. In the recovery period, the body’s tissues will begin to grow around the mesh, reinforcing the corrective effects of the procedure.","Men can also undergo the sling procedure. A variety of urinary sling products are specifically designed for men; these are called male urinary slings. Men often choose the sling procedure for UI where possible to avoid surgical options that involve the insertion of a mechanical device, like an artificial urinary sphincter.[6] (See the section on Artificial urinary sphincter.","A further advantage of the sling procedure is that correct urinary function is generally restored to the affected person within hours. Additionally, recovery times are usually short, minimizing the need to refrain from normal daily activities.",Bladder neck suspension,Bladder neck suspension surgery is solely used to relieve stress incontinence in men and women. The procedure involves restoring a deteriorated bladder to its previous position within the pelvis.,Bladder suspension surgery is used to treat UI arising from:,"
Muscle deterioration
Changes to the body caused by pregnancy and related internal damage
Menopause and associated complications
","Bladder neck suspension surgery is highly successful at relieving UI for a prolonged period of time in most cases, but the effects of the surgery are not always permanent, and UI eventually returns in a small number of cases.",Artificial urinary sphincter,This is primarily used to relieve stress incontinence in men and is rarely recommended for women.,"The procedure involves the insertion of a device called an artificial urinary sphincter which consists of a reservoir which holds the urine securely in the abdomen, and a circular cuff which releases a flow of urine when the device is activated.","This is not a popular type of surgery for UI. In addition to experiencing pain and bleeding in the postoperative period, many people find that artificial urinary sphincters have a tendency to stop working. Further surgery is then needed to remove the device.",Prolapse surgery,"In some women, a vaginal prolapse can put pressure on the bladder, causing UI. Prolapses occur when weakness in the vaginal walls causes the formation of a bulge which protrudes beyond the pelvic area. They can be triggered by activities and physical states which place exertion on the pelvic area, such as heavy lifting, pregnancy or straining repeatedly to pass a bowel movement. The protruding lump will usually come out of the vagina, and can contain the bladder, bowel, uterus or all three of these body parts.","Surgery to correct a vaginal prolapse can restore the prolapsed parts to their correct anatomical position, and can thereby relieve pressure on the bladder and restore normal urinary function.","However, vaginal prolapse surgery alone cannot treat any case of UI which is triggered by any additional or alternative causes to a vaginal prolapse. Furthermore, complications from the surgery, such as an infection at the surgery site where the wound is healing, can also trigger UI or cause it to return.[7]",Weight loss,"It is very common for UI to co-occur with obesity. The risk of developing UI among those affected by obesity is greatly increased, the higher a person’s body mass index (BMI) is: each 5-unit increase in a person’s BMI correlates to an increased risk of developing UI, which can range from 20 to 70 percent. The link between UI and obesity is believed to relate to excess weight contributing to increased abdominal pressure, which can disrupt normal urinary function.[8]","In obese people, losing weight can be an effective way to reduce the impact of UI and should be considered before surgery as part of an initial treatment plan. Losing five to ten percent of one’s total body weight can have a similar effect to other non-surgical treatments for alleviating UI in obese people.",Treatment options for weight loss for treating UI in obese or overweight people may include:[9][10][11][12],Lifestyle changes,"Eating healthily and increasing the amount of physical activity can help a person to lose weight, which can reduce the symptoms of UI. Stopping smoking, staying hydrated, consuming increased quantities of fresh fruits and vegetables and reducing consumption of sugary foods can increase a person’s metabolic rate and also contribute to weight loss, which can help to treat UI.",Liquid-diet weight reduction program,"A low-calorie liquid diet (of around 800 calories per day or less) with increased exercise has been found to be effective at inducing weight loss and reducing symptoms in women with UI. However, major changes to a person’s diet, especially a significantly reduced calorie intake, should only be carried out under the supervision of a nutritionist, in order to ensure that they are suitable and safe for the affected person.",Weight reduction surgery,"Also called bariatric or metabolic surgery, weight loss surgery is a major surgical procedure which can help very overweight people to lose weight rapidly. It may involve having a gastric band, gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy: each of these options aims to shrink the capacity to of the stomach so that the affected person feels full sooner, reducing their food intake and ultimately losing weight. In UI caused by obesity, weight reduction surgery may help a person lose weight to the point where they are no longer affected by UI more quickly than is usually possible by means of diet or exercise alone.",Prevention,"Although UI is a symptom of other conditions and/or physical states that exert pressure on the bladder (such as pregnancy) which it may not be possible to avoid, it is possible to minimize the risk of experiencing UI by taking measures to reduce the frequency and acidity of your urination and to exercise the pelvic floor muscles.",Methods which may contribute to the prevention of UI include:,"
Regular exercise
Avoiding spicy and acidic foods
Avoiding caffeine and alcohol
Eating high-fiber foods to avoid constipation
Maintaining a healthy body weight
Kegel exercises to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles
",Urinary incontinence treatment FAQs,"Q: Are there any effective natural remedies for UI?
A: There is a growing interest in the use of alternative remedies for all manner of health conditions, including UI. In particular, increasing numbers of people are exploring treatments derived from homeopathy, a branch of alternative medicine involving the consumption of special natural tinctures, and Ayurvedic medicine,an alternative system of medicine with historical Indian roots.","However, the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) does not currently recognize] the efficacy of any homeopathic, Ayurvedic or any other natural remedies for UI. For the best treatment of UI, anyone who is or may be affected should seek a regular medical appointment in a clinical setting from a licensed healthcare provider, in order to access treatment options (medications and/or procedures) that have been found to be effective in clinical trials.","If a person wishes to experiment with any alternative remedies for UI, such as the use of particular herbs, spice or essential oils, they should always consult their healthcare provider before starting these treatments. There is insufficient medical understanding of the mechanisms of action or the efficacy of alternative remedies and practices for treating UI, for these treatments to be FDA-recommended. Furthermore, some alternative products may be unsuitable for people with certain medical conditions or be unsuitable for use with certain pharmaceutical medications. Feeling unwell?

A: Spina bifida is a congenital condition (a condition which is present from birth) in which the spine and spinal cord do not develop properly, causing a gap in the spine.[13] Urinary incontinence is one of the principal symptoms of spina bifida and is caused by the neural connections between the brain and the bladder being broken in most people with the condition, leading to loss of sensation and/or poor bladder control.","UI related to spina bifida may improve on its own if the condition is treated or managed successfully. Overflow or mixed incontinence are the types of UI most commonly experienced, and a variety of treatment options may be effective; doctors will advise on the treatment that is right for each person. In particular, people with spina bifida may be prescribed anticholinergic medications, which help to prevent involuntary bladder spasms.[13]","Q: What treatment options are recommended for people with UI caused by a stroke?
A: It is common for people to have continence problems after a stroke. Frequency, urgency, functional stress and nocturnal incontinence are types of UI which are commonly experienced in the short-term. For many people, UI caused by a stroke goes away on its own, although this may take months, depending on the extent of the damage caused by the stroke. For the majority of people affected by continence problems after a stroke, these resolve within a year.[14] In the meantime, absorbent pads and other products are an effective means of managing any urinary leakage.","If continence does not return as expected, any underlying causes for the UI beyond the stroke will need to be diagnosed. The affected person can then begin suitable treatments. In this situation, medications, behavioral therapies and exercises to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles are considered as first-line treatments for persistent UI. If these methods prove ineffective, bladder stimulation or surgery may be considered.[14]"
,,,,,,,,,,What is a urinary tract infection?
,,,,,,,,,,What is a urinary tract infection?,"Urinary tract infection is an infection of the urinary system which is caused by bacteria infecting any part of the urinary system, which includes the urethra (the tube between the bladder and the skin), the bladder, ureters (tubes between the kidneys and the bladder) and the kidneys. Infection of the bladder is called cystitis. Infection of the kidneys is called pyelonephritis. The infection is non-transmittable. It usually develops when bacteria from the bowel or the genital region ascend through the urethra to the bladder or kidney. Symptoms include fever, pain in the lower abdomen, frequent urination in small portions and an odd smell to the urine. With antibiotic treatment, most people recover quickly.",Feeling unwell? People experiencing symptoms that may be linked to a urinary tract infection can carry out a symptom assessment using the free Ada app now.,Risks,"Women are more prone to infection since their urethra (the tube between the bladder and the skin) is shorter. Post-menopausal women may be more susceptible than pre-menopausal women to this condition. Any obstruction that impairs urine flow increases the risk for urinary tract infection, for example, prostate enlargement or kidney stones. Other risk factors include a weakened immune system, pregnancy, the use of urinary catheters and diabetes.",Symptoms,"Lower urinary tract infection affects the urinary bladder and produces symptoms such as painful and frequent urination, pain low in the belly or and strong-smelling urine that is sometimes bloody or cloudy. Other symptoms may be fever, chills and generally feeling ill. Flank or back pain can be a sign that the infection has spread to the kidneys (pyelonephritis).","If you are experiencing possible symptoms of a uninary tract infection, carry out a symptom assessment with the free Ada app now.",Diagnosis,"The diagnosis is based on the symptoms and clinical examination and completed by analysis of the urine, testing for blood and pus. It may be necessary to send the urine to a lab to diagnose the specific bacteria causing the infection. It may also be necessary to have an ultrasound scan of the bladder and kidneys if a person suffers recurrent urinary tract infections.",Treatment,"Urinary tract infections are treated with antibiotics. Staying well hydrated is helpful to flush bacteria from the bladder. Bed rest is recommended in cases of pyelonephritis. If the underlying cause is a malformation of the urinary tract or bladder obstruction, further therapy is needed.",Prevention,"Keeping the area of the urinary meatus (where urine exits the body) clean helps to prevent urinary tract infections. Avoiding contraceptive methods that contain spermicide may be useful in avoiding urinary tract infections. Emptying the bladder after sexual intercourse may help prevent infections in women. In some cases of recurrent urinary tract infection, antibiotic prophylaxis must be considered."
,,,,,,,,,,What is uveitis?
,,,,,,,,,,What is uveitis?,Uveitis is a broad term used to describe an inflammation of the uveal tract of the eye.,The uveal tract is composed of:,"
The iris: the part of the eye making up a person’s eye color
The ciliary body: a small muscle behind the iris
The choroid: a layer of tissue between the retina (a light sensitive inner coat of the eye), and the sclera (the dense connective tissue that forms the white of the eye)
",The uveal tract is an area containing a large proportion of the eyes’ blood vessels.[^1],"Uveitis typically causes pain and blurred vision, but can, in the majority of cases, be successfully treated through the use of medication. However, if left untreated, the condition can lead to complications including glaucoma, cataracts and possible blindness.[1]","Uveitis is a relatively rare condition, affecting roughly 2-5 people in every 10,000. It can affect people of any age, though is most common in those aged 20 to 59.[2]",Types of uveitis,"There are various types of uveitis, each classified according to the part of the uveal tract the inflammation affects:","
Anterior uveitis: Affecting the front section of the uveal tract. This is the most common form of the condition and is typically caused by infection, inflammatory diseases or trauma, e.g. blunt force to the eye.
Intermediate uveitis: Affecting the middle section of the uveal tract. Typically caused by diseases such as sarcoidosis.
Posterior uveitis: Affecting the rear of the uveal tract. This is a rare form of the condition.
Panuveitis: When the condition affects the entirety of the uveal tract. This is the most severe form of the condition, which can lead to serious damage to the retina.
",Each type of uveitis is also classified by the frequency at which it occurs. Uveitis can be:,"
Acute: Quick to develop and will improve within three months.
Recurrent: Repeated episodes separated by a number of months.
Chronic: Episodes last for a significant period and inflammation returns within three months of treatment.
",Symptoms of uveitis,"Symptoms of uveitis, which may affect one or both eyes, can include:[3]","
Blurred vision
Floaters (dark, hovering spots in vision)
Pain in the eyes
Redness of the eyes
Light sensitivity (photophobia)
","If any symptoms are being experienced or uveitis is suspected, medical attention from a doctor, optician or ophthalmologist (eye specialist) should be sought with urgency. In addition, the free Ada app can be used to carry out a symptom assessment.",Signs and symptoms of uveitis differ depending on what type of the condition is being experienced:,"
Anterior uveitis is typically associated with pain, blurred vision, light sensitivity and redness.
Intermediate uveitis is typically associated with floaters and blurred vision, while pain and also eye redness are uncommon.
Posterior uveitis is typically associated with blurred vision and in some cases a loss of vision, pain is most likely absent and the eye most likely won’t be reddened.
",Causes of uveitis,There are three main causes of uveitis:[^1],"
An autoimmune disorder or inflammatory disease
Infection
Physical trauma or injury to the eye, including eye surgery
","Often, no specific cause of uveitis can be identified.",Autoimmune disorder or inflammatory disease,"Autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis and Behcet's disease have been linked to uveitis. An autoimmune disorder is characterized by the body’s immune system producing antibodies to attack its own tissues, with the result, in the case of uveitis, of causing inflammation. The exact reason as to why the immune systems of some people behave this way is unknown.","It is also believed that individuals with inflammatory diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis, sarcoidosis and inflammatory bowel diseases, e.g. ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease, are more likely to develop uveitis.",Infection,"Bacterial, fungal or viral infection can cause uveitis in some cases. Possible infection types include toxoplasmosis, herpes simplex, herpes zoster, cytomegalovirus, gonorrhea, tuberculosis and Lyme disease.",Injury,"If the eye suffers an injury, this can also lead to uveitis.",Diagnosing uveitis,"The first stage of diagnosing uveitis will normally involve a doctor’s examination. If symptoms of the condition are present and uveitis is suspected, a doctor may then refer the individual to an eye specialist, an ophthalmologist, for further examination and confirmation of the diagnosis.","Specialists will typically test the individual’s vision, allowing them to see how the condition may be affecting it and assess any differences between each eye. Both eyes will also be examined using a microscope, usually an instrument called a slit-lamp, enabling the doctor to look for signs of inflammation.[^1]",Laboratory tests may also be required to rule out infection and any other condition that may be causing the symptoms.[3],Uveitis treatment,"Treatment for uveitis is aimed at reducing pain and inflammation, repairing any loss of vision and attempting to treat any underlying causes. The chosen treatment route will depend upon the specific type of the condition being experienced and what is causing it.","In most cases, medication will be the primary treatment method, but in some cases surgery may also be required.",Treatment will usually include:[4],Steroid medications,"The use of steroid medications (glucocorticoids, hormones based on cholesterol) is common in the treatment of uveitis. Steroids can be administered in different ways, with the chosen method depending on what type of the condition is being experienced.","
Steroid eye-drops: Typically used in the initial treatment of anterior uveitis when it is not caused by an infection. The severity of the condition will decide the prescribed dose and how often the drops should be administered. It is important to continue using the eye drops even after symptoms have disappeared to prevent recurrence.
Steroid injections: Typically used in cases of intermediate or posterior uveitis or if steroid eye drops have proven unsuccessful. The injection is administered to the outside of the eyeball (periocular). A doctor will administer the injection using local anesthetic to minimize any pain or discomfort as much as possible. Generally, only one injection will be needed when the symptoms are at their worst.
Steroid tablets: The strongest form of steroid medication, usually administered if other options have not worked. Side-effects can be severe, so steroid tablets will generally only be used if there is a risk of permanent damage to the eyes. It is important to continue using the tablets as prescribed even after symptoms have disappeared to prevent recurrence. The severity of the condition will determine how long an individual’s steroid tablet course will have to last, which could be anywhere between a number of weeks and,  in much rarer cases, up to a number of years.
",Mydriatic eye drops,"Mydriatic eye drops may be prescribed in cases of anterior uveitis, in addition to steroid eye drops. This type of medication relaxes the muscles in the eye and thereby widens the pupil of the eye, helping to relieve pain and reduce the risk of glaucoma. They can, however, lead to a temporary blurring of vision.",Treating infection,"If uveitis is being caused by an infection, this may be treated using either antibiotics, antiviral medication or antifungal medication. If the condition does not improve after using these medications, immunosuppressants may be prescribed.","Immunosuppressants work by suppressing immune system responses, thereby disrupting the process of inflammation. There is, however, a risk of side effects. These may include:","
Skin rash
Numbness
Loss of appetite
Nausea
High blood pressure
Headaches
Breathlessness
","People concerned about possible side-effects should consult a doctor. In addition, the free Ada app can be used to carry  out a symptom assessment.",Surgery,"In rare cases, surgery may be required to treat uveitis. This will typically be the case if the condition recurs frequently or if it is particularly severe.","The surgical procedure used to treat uveitis is called a vitrectomy. During the procedure, the substance that fills the interior of the eye, the vitreous, is removed and temporarily replaced with air, gas or a liquid substitute. Eventually, the eye will naturally replace the substance by itself.[5]",A vitrectomy can be carried out using either local or general (patient is asleep during the procedure) anesthetic and – like any surgical procedure – comes with some risk of complications.,Immunotherapy,"In cases where other medical treatment options have been ineffective, a relatively new form of treatment called immunotherapy or biologic therapy may be prescribed. This involves the use of medications containing biological agents, i.e.natural antibodies, which can specifically target the eye area, treating the pain and inflammation associated with uveitis.","The types of biologic medication most commonly used to treat uveitis are called infliximab and adalimumab. Biologic medications have the potential to improve an affected person’s quality of life. However, no long-term safety data has been collected about this form of treatment yet. Immunotherapy should therefore only be undertaken accompanied by close supervision from an experienced doctor.",Uveitis complications,"If treatment for uveitis is not received quickly enough, complications can occur. Complications are more likely to occur in:","
People over 60
People with chronic uveitis
People with intermediate,posterior uveitis or panuveitis
",Some of the most common uveitis complications include:,"
Glaucoma: Inflammation can cause pressure to be put on the eyes, leading to glaucoma. If left untreated, this can lead to a loss of vision.
Cataracts: A clouding of the eye’s lens, which can be caused by inflammation or steroidal treatment methods. If left untreated, this can lead to a loss of vision.
Detached retina: When the retina begins to pull away from the eye due to inflammation. This can lead to serious vision problems.
Cystoid macular oedema: Involving a buildup of fluid in the rear of the eye, leading to retinal swelling. This can lead to blurred vision.
Posterior synechiae: When the iris sticks to the lens of the eye. It is most likely if treatment for uveitis is delayed.
","People experiencing possible uveitis complications should consult a doctor. In addition, the free Ada app can be used to carry  out a symptom assessment.",Uveitis FAQs,"Q: What is the prognosis for a person with uveitis?
A: With early and appropriate treatment, most cases of uveitis can be managed effectively. However, all types of uveitis can become chronic and recur frequently. If this is the case, individuals may be given eye drops in advance, allowing them to use them as soon as symptoms begin to occur. Uveitis caused by an infection tends to disappear once the infection has been properly treated, and does not recur.[^1]",Other names for uveitis,"

Also known as pink eye, conjunctivitis is often caused by a virus, for example one of the variety that causes the common cold, though it can be caused by bacteria or allergies too. When pink eye is caused by a virus, it is called viral conjunctivitis. Like all types of pink eye, viral conjunctivitis is common but not usually serious.[1][2][3][4]",Viral conjunctivitis typically begins in one eye and then spreads to the other. The main symptoms of viral conjunctivitis include:[2][5][6][7],"
Pinkness or, often, intense redness of the eye
Burning, a sensation of grittiness, or mild pain or discomfort in the eye
Watery discharge from the eye
Swollen and/or reddened eyelids
Other symptoms of viral infection, e.g. sore throat, runny nose and other cold symptoms
","Most mild cases of viral conjunctivitis clear up on their own within a couple of weeks, without any specific treatment. Cleaning the eyes with water and a clean cloth or sterile pad, applying warm or cool compresses, and using lubricating eye drops, also known as artificial tears, may help to relieve symptoms. However, antiviral medications may be recommended for more serious cases of viral conjunctivitis. Antibiotics are not useful for treating viral conjunctivitis.[2][3][5][6][7]","Generally, people make a complete recovery, and viral conjunctivitis does not cause any complications. However, cases caused by certain viruses, such as herpes simplex, the cold sore virus, or varicella-zoster, the virus that causes chickenpox and shingles, can be serious and may cause lasting eye problems if not managed effectively.[8] Furthermore, if viral conjunctivitis occurs in newborn babies or people with weakened immune systems, such as those who have HIV or are undergoing treatment for cancer, it can be severe, and medical advice should be sought without delay.[3][7]","In addition, anyone experiencing severe symptoms should see a doctor immediately. These include:[3][6][7]","
Intense pain in the eye
Extreme redness, especially in one eye only
Inability to open the eye

Intense pain in the eye
Extreme redness, especially in one eye only
Inability to open the eye
Severe sensitivity to light
Discharge that contains a lot of pus
Constant blurred vision, or difficulty seeing
","A doctor will take the person’s medical history and ask whether anyone they know might have had an eye infection recently. They will examine the eyes and assess the signs and symptoms present, taking care to rule out allergic conjunctivitis, bacterial conjunctivitis, dry eye syndrome and other more serious eye conditions, such as uveitis and keratitis.[2][3]","If the conjunctivitis seems severe or very long-lasting, the doctor may take a small sample of discharge from the eye and send it for laboratory tests to identify the cause and determine the most effective treatment approach.[3][9]",Viral conjunctivitis treatment,Mild cases of viral conjunctivitis often clear up within roughly 1-3 weeks without special medical treatment.

When polyps become large or numerous, they can block the airways and cause sinusitis. The reasons why some people develop nasal polyps are largely unknown.","Chronic sinusitis with fungal allergy: Air routinely contains small amounts of fungus, which most people can inhale without issue. Others, however, can experience an allergic reaction to this fungus, which causes a thick mucus to form in the sinuses. This can then lead to chronic sinusitis.",Several factors can make an individual more prone to chronic sinusitis or make the symptoms worse when the condition is being experienced. These include:,"Allergies, especially those that are experienced all year round, can both increase one’s risk of chronic sinusitis and worsen its symptoms. These allergies include those to dust mites, animal hair and mold.","Airborne irritants, including things like tobacco smoke and formaldehyde, can increase the risk of developing chronic sinusitis.",People with an immune system disorder are at increased risk of developing chronic sinusitis.,Diagnosing sinusitis (sinus infection),"Most cases of sinusitis will resolve themselves in around one to three weeks and not require a visit to the doctor. However, if a person is concerned about their symptoms, symptoms are particularly severe or last longer than the normal timeframe, seeking medical attention is advised.","Upon visiting a doctor, they will typically ask some questions about the symptoms being experienced and perform a physical examination. This may include an anterior rhinoscopy, which involves a doctor using a lighted instrument to examine the nose and sinuses. Through this, a doctor will usually be able to confirm a diagnosis of sinusitis. If the symptoms persist for longer than 12 weeks, a doctor will be able to confirm a diagnosis of chronic sinusitis.","If chronic sinusitis is confirmed, further tests may be required to establish what form of the condition is being experienced. This may involve a nasal endoscopy, in which a lighted, flexible tube mounted with a camera is inserted into the nasal cavity and sinuses for examination purposes.[7]",Sinusitis (sinus infection) treatment,Acute sinusitis and chronic sinusitis will typically require different treatment methods.,Treatment for acute sinusitis,"In most cases, acute sinusitis will not require any specialist treatment from a doctor. As the condition will typically resolve itself naturally in a number of weeks, a combination of self-care methods and over-the-counter medications is usually sufficient. These include:[8][9]","
Painkillers such as ibuprofen and paracetamol can help with pain relief.
Decongestant nasal sprays can be effective in the short-term at resolving a blocked nose. However, long-term use (over 5-7 days) is not advised.
Staying hydrated and getting plenty of rest is advised to aid recovery.
Warm face packs or a warm flannel placed over the face can help ease congestion and a blocked nose.
","If the symptoms are particularly severe, a doctor may prescribe:","
Antibiotics may be prescribed in rare cases. As acute sinusitis is typically caused by a virus, antibiotics cannot be used as a cure. However, they may be prescribed when symptoms are severe; when an individual also has a heart problem, cystic fibrosis or a weak immune system; or when symptoms do not seem to be getting better or are worsening.
Steroidal nasal sprays may be prescribed to help relieve particularly severe sinus inflammation.
",Treatment for chronic sinusitis,"Chronic sinusitis will generally require long-term management. Different people will require different treatment methods depending on which type of the condition is being experienced, its severity and whether any other conditions are also being experienced.",Treatment methods include:[10],"Lifestyle changes: People with chronic sinusitis who smoke cigarettes should quit, as smoke can aggravate the condition. Moreover, people with allergies which contribute to their condition should aim to limit their exposure to allergens. This may involve making environmental changes at home or in the workplace.",Saline solution: Daily washing of the nasal passageways with a saline solution may be useful in helping to reduce inflammation.,"Steroid nasal sprays: Nasal sprays containing steroids are effective at reducing inflammation. Doctors will normally prescribe a course, with its length depending on the severity of the condition. If inflammation is very severe, steroid pills may be prescribed. However, this is not routine due to the risk of side-effects such as sleeping problems and acne.","Antibiotics: In some cases, sinusitis may result from a bacterial infection. In these cases, antibiotics may be prescribed. The course will generally need to be prolonged (3-4 weeks).","Over-the-counter medications: If the symptoms of acute sinusitis develop on top of the symptoms of chronic sinusitis, painkillers such as ibuprofen and paracetamol can be effective at reducing pain. Decongestant nasal sprays can also be effective at relieving a blocked nose. These nasal sprays, however, provide only short-term relief and should not be used for more than 5-7 days at a time.",Surgery,"Typically, surgery is seen as a last-resort treatment option, but may be necessary in some cases. Situations that may call for surgery include:","
When the use of medication has proven to be ineffective
A CT scan shows there is evidence of persistent sinus disease
Nasal polyps do not respond to treatment
In cases of allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (which usually involves the complete blockage of one or more sinus)
There is severe septum deviation
","Surgery is generally effective at reducing inflammation and relieving symptoms in the short term. However, even after surgery, chronic sinusitis will generally require lifelong management and the underlying causes of the condition will still need to be addressed.",Sinusitis complications,"Complications as a result of chronic sinusitis are rare. In some cases, however, a sinus infection may spread to other areas, including the bones, blood and brain. This tends to be more common in children with the condition. Medical attention should be sought urgently if there is any swelling of the face, as this may be a sign of complications.[10]",Sinusitis (sinus infection) FAQs,"Q: What is a sinus headache?
A: A sinus headache is a type of headache caused by inflammation of the sinuses, typically experienced as a symptom of sinusitis.

,,,,,,,,,,What is vitamin B12 deficiency?
,,,,,,,,,,What is vitamin B12 deficiency?,Vitamin B12 deficiency occurs when there are inadequate levels of the vitamin B12 in the body. This important vitamin is necessary for the production of red blood cells and the healthy functioning of the nervous system.,A lack of vitamin B12 can cause anemia and other health problems.[1][2] Anemia is a condition where the body either cannot make enough healthy red blood cells or cannot produce enough of the substance hemoglobin that allows red blood cells to transport oxygen around the body.,"There are several different types of anemia, each with their own causes and symptoms. For example, vitamin B12 deficiency can cause megaloblastic anemia, a condition where the red blood cells are larger than normal and cannot function properly.[2][3]","For many people, a balanced and varied diet provides all the vitamin B12 they need.[2] Good sources of vitamin B12 include meat, fish, eggs and dairy products.","Despite the availability of vitamin B12 in a balanced diet, deficiency is not all that uncommon, particularly among people over 50 years of age, premenopausal women and people who follow strict vegan diets.[4][5]","Low levels of vitamin B12 may be the result of a number of different factors and conditions. One of the most common causes of vitamin B12 deficiency is pernicious anemia, a condition where a person’s immune system mistakenly reduces their ability to absorb the vitamin. Less common causes of deficiency include conditions affecting the stomach or intestines that interfere with absorption of vitamin B12, inadequate dietary intake, and certain medications.[1][6]","Symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency usually develop gradually and can be wide-ranging. These may include general symptoms of [anemia]((/conditions/anemia/), such as fatigue and lethargy, as well as the symptoms specific to the deficiency, such as yellow tinge to the skin and a sore tongue.","If left untreated, the symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency tend to worsen and irreversible problems involving the nerves and brain may develop. The risk of experiencing a number of serious complications, including heart failure, may also increase.[3][7] For this reason, it is important to seek medical advice without delay should any of these symptoms be present.",Worried you may have vitamin B12 deficiency?

",Ada can help you check your symptoms. Download the free Ada app to begin your personal health assessment.,Causes of vitamin B12 deficiency,"Pernicious anemia is a common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency. There are several other possible causes of the deficiency, but they tend to be less common.[2]",Pernicious anemia,"In order for vitamin B12 to be absorbed by the body, it needs to be combined with a protein called intrinsic factor in the stomach. This protein is produced by cells in the stomach lining. In people with pernicious anemia, the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks these cells, preventing intrinsic factor from combining with vitamin B12 and hampering its absorption.[2][7]","Pernicious anemia is an autoimmune condition that most commonly affects people over 50 years old, and women seem to be more likely to develop it. Pernicious anemia is thought to run in families and seems to affect people who have other autoimmune conditions, such as Hashimoto’s thyroiditis and Addison’s disease, more often than those who do not. A healthcare practitioner can order a blood test to check for pernicious anemia.[2][7]",Conditions affecting the stomach and intestines,"People who have certain conditions that affect the stomach and intestines, or have had certain types of surgery, may be at risk of vitamin B12 deficiency.[2][7][10]","
Stomach conditions. Atrophic gastritis, which causes thinning of the stomach lining, infection with Helicobacter pylori bacteria, and a genetic condition that causes a lack of intrinsic factor can all cause vitamin B12 deficiency.
Intestinal conditions. Crohn’s disease, a condition that causes inflammation of the lining of the digestive tract, celiac disease,[8] chronic tropical sprue and a number of other conditions may lead to vitamin B12 deficiency.
Surgery. Surgical procedures that remove part or all of the stomach, or the end of the small intestine, may prevent adequate absorption of vitamin B12.
",Medications,"Some medicines can interfere with the absorption of vitamin B12, potentially leading to a deficiency if precautions are not taken. Metformin, a medicine commonly prescribed for diabetes, is one example. Others include neomycin, chloramphenicol,[8] colchicine and certain anticonvulsant drugs.[2]","In addition, the long-term use of certain medicines that are used to treat stomach conditions, such as heartburn and peptic ulcers,[11] can worsen an existing vitamin B12 deficiency, but do not cause it. Examples of these drugs include proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H2 blockers.[2][7]",Good to know: People taking any of these types of medication should discuss concerns about vitamin B12 deficiency with their healthcare practitioner.,Inadequate dietary intake,"Though fairly uncommon, some people may develop vitamin B12 deficiency as a result of low levels in their daily diet. A balanced diet typically provides sufficient vitamin B12; however, strict vegans and people with a poor diet are at higher risk of developing a deficiency.[2][7] Good sources of vitamin B12 include:","
Meat
Fish
Eggs
Dairy products
","In addition, some breakfast cereals, soy products and other foods are fortified with vitamin B12. Fruit and vegetable products do not contain vitamin B12, unless they have been specially fortified.[1][8]","In healthy people, the body tends to have a store of vitamin B12 that can last two to five years without being replenished. As a result, a deficiency may take several years to develop.[7][12]","It is important that people making long-term dietary changes, for example becoming vegan, eat food products that have been fortified with vitamin B12 or take a supplement to reduce the risk of developing a deficiency.[9]",Diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency,A doctor will typically take the person’s medical history and perform a physical examination.,"If they suspect a vitamin B12 deficiency, they will usually request blood tests to be done. These tests can measure levels of vitamin B12 and folic acid, as well as the size and concentration of hemoglobin within the person’s red blood cells.[7]",Drawbacks of blood tests for vitamin B12 deficiency,"Some people experience symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency despite their blood tests indicating normal levels. The test measures the total amount of the vitamin in the blood, but not all of it can necessarily be used by the body.[7] In addition, the range of normal levels may differ between laboratories.[13]","For these reasons, healthcare practitioners will usually consider signs and symptoms, as well as the results of the blood tests when diagnosing vitamin B12 deficiency.[13]",Read more about Blood Test Results »,Tests to identify the cause,"If vitamin B12 deficiency is suspected or confirmed, further tests may be required to identify the cause. This will help to determine the recommended course of treatment. These investigations may include further blood tests for pernicious anemia[7] and other conditions.","Some people may be referred to specialists for further tests or treatment. These include hematologists, doctors specializing in blood conditions, and gastroenterologists, doctors specializing in the digestive system.[1]",Ruling out folate deficiency,"A deficiency of folate, the nutrient also known as folic acid or vitamin B9, good sources of which include foods like broccoli, asparagus, peas and brown rice, can cause some of the same symptoms as vitamin B12 deficiency.[7] For this reason, a doctor will typically examine the levels of folate in blood tests when checking for vitamin B12 deficiency.[3]","Taking a lot of folic acid can mask the symptoms of a vitamin B12 deficiency, so in cases where folate deficiency is suspected, a doctor will usually test for vitamin B12 deficiency before prescribing medication.[12]",Read more about Folate Deficiency »,Functional vitamin B12 deficiency,"Sometimes blood tests will show normal serum levels of vitamin B12, but a person may experience symptoms and complications related to a deficiency. This can be known as fuctional vitamin B12 deficiency. In these cases, there may be an issue with the processing of vitamin B12 in the body.","Like most other cases of vitamin B12 deficiency, the condition can be treated with high doses of vitamin B12.[7][14] However, a prolonged functional vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to the same problems as a regular vitamin B12 deficiency.[7]",Treatment of Vitamin B12 deficiency,"Treatment will depend on the reasons for the vitamin B12 deficiency. In most cases, having injections or taking a prescribed oral supplement will be sufficient to treat the condition.[7]","A doctor may recommend having high-dose injections of vitamin B12, usually in a form called hydroxocobalamin, every second day for two weeks, or until symptoms have cleared.","If the cause of the deficiency is dietary, the doctor may advise taking a daily supplement or continuing to have injections twice a year or more, indefinitely.[7] They may also refer the person to a dietician for advice on ways to increase vitamin B12 intake in their diet.[1][3]","In cases where the deficiency is not related to a person’s diet, it will usually be necessary to have vitamin B12 injections every three months or more frequently, for the rest of their life.[7]","People who have symptoms that affect their nervous system, such as pins and needles or numbness, may be referred to a hematologist for specialized management of the deficiency. It may be necessary for them to have injections every two months or more frequently, for life.[2][7]",Vitamin B12 injections typically do not have any side-effects other than a small amount of discomfort where the needle is inserted.[2],"Follow-up blood tests will generally be requested one to three months after starting treatment, to check that vitamin B12 levels have returned to normal. Thereafter, a doctor may advise a once-yearly follow-up test.[7][3][12]","In most cases, a vitamin B12 deficiency is easy to treat and complications are rare.[1] However, in some cases, particularly where there has been a severe or prolonged deficiency, nerve damage may be permanent and irreversible.[2][3]",Good to know: Over-the-counter supplements do not usually contain adequate amounts of vitamin B12 to correct a deficiency.[11],Prevention of vitamin B12 deficiency,"While it may not be possible to prevent vitamin B12 deficiency in all cases, steps can be taken to reduce the likelihood of the condition developing.",A person should speak to their healthcare practitioner about getting their vitamin B12 levels checked periodically if they:[9],"

",Vitamin B12 deficiency FAQs,"Q: Are vegetarians and vegans at risk of vitamin B12 deficiency?
A: Yes. Vitamin B12 is found in animal products like meat, fish and dairy, but not plant products, meaning that people following a vegan or vegetarian diet are at an increased risk of developing a vitamin B12 deficiency due to inadequate dietary intake.[4][7] To minimize the likelihood of a deficiency, it is recommended that strict vegans and vegetarians include foods that have been fortified with vitamin B12 in their daily diet. Examples include certain breads, soy products and cereals, as well as certain yeast extracts.[7][9] It may also be necessary to take a daily supplement.[9]","Q: Can vitamin B12 deficiency cause depression?
A: Yes. A vitamin B12 deficiency can cause a wide range of symptoms, including psychiatric symptoms like irritability, psychosis and depression.[3] It is important to remember that depression can be caused by a number of different factors.

A: Yes. Research shows that even moderate alcohol consumption may decrease vitamin B12 levels, and alcoholics are thought to be at risk of vitamin B12 deficiency. In some cases, blood tests may show falsely high levels of vitamin B12; this confusing status can be caused by alcoholic liver disease and may mask a functional vitamin B12 deficiency.[15][16][17]"
,,,,,,,,,,What is vitamin D deficiency?
,,,,,,,,,,What is vitamin D deficiency?,"Vitamin D deficiency is also known as hypovitaminosis D. It is the most common nutritional deficiency worldwide,[1] affecting people of all age groups.[2]",Vitamin D is one of the most important vitamins ‒ essential compounds on which the body’s cells rely for normal development. Nearly every cell in the body has a receptor for vitamin D.[3],Vitamin D levels in the body can be maintained in two ways:,"
The body can, itself, make vitamin D from its resources of cholesterol. To do this, it needs access to sunlight.
Vitamin D can be found in certain foods, such as fatty fish. (However, it is rare for a person to gain all the vitamin D that their body needs from food alone.)
",Some of the most important functions of vitamin D include:,"
Maintenance of normal calcium and phosphate levels
Promotion of calcium absorption (essential for healthy bones and teeth)
Growth of cells and bones
Reduction of inflammation, such as can be caused by infection or injury
","When a person has vitamin D deficiency, the body's cells become less efficient at carrying out processes such as growth and regeneration.",Symptoms of vitamin D deficiency,"If the body does not contain sufficient vitamin D, this can give rise to a variety of health complications. Problems arising from vitamin D deficiency include fatigue, depressed mood and bone and muscle pain.",Vitamin D is particularly instrumental in maintaining healthy bones.

People whose bodies require a greater intake of vitamin D are at greater risk of experiencing vitamin D deficiency.","Being an infant or an elderly person, being obese, having darker skin and/or experiencing a health condition which compromises one’s ability to absorb vitamins properly (such as Coeliac disease or inflammatory bowel diseases) are all factors which may increase the daily quantity of vitamin D an individual requires.",Factors which increase the likelihood of being affected by vitamin D deficiency include:,"
Living in countries where there is little sun all year round
Having darker skin (the more pigmented a person’s skin is, the better it is able to produce melanin, which absorbs UVB radiation and reduces the synthesis of vitamin D)[6]
Wearing high-factor sunscreen
Spending the majority of one’s time indoors
Malabsorption as a result of conditions such as Coeliac disease which impede the normal uptake of nutrients
Avoiding foods which provide a source of vitamin D such as fatty fish and dairy products
Being obese
Being elderly
","The main source of vitamin D is exposure to solar UVB radiation (from sunlight.[4] When the body is exposed to sunlight, it can manufacture vitamin D from cholesterol, a fatty substance synthesized by the liver and found in some foods. Anything that reduces a person’s access to solar UVB radiation will compromise the body’s ability to manufacture sufficient levels of vitamin D,[4] therefore eventually causing vitamin D deficiency.",Lacking vitamin D in one’s diet,"Vitamin D deficiency can be caused by failing to gain sufficient amounts of vitamin D from one's diet, leading to insufficient levels in the body overall.",The recommended daily intake of vitamin D is:[7],"
400 IU (international units) for children under one year
600 IU for children, teens and adults up to age 70
800 IU for pregnant people and adults over the age of 71
","To increase a person’s chances of meeting the vitamin D target for their age group, healthcare professionals advise everybody to ensure that their diet contains sources of vitamin D – which can be found in certain foods, especially in fatty fish, such as salmon or tuna, and certain dairy products, like milk and cheese.","However, most foods that contain vitamin D do not contain sufficient quantities to meet a person’s daily required intake. For this reason, many traditionally consumed sources of vitamin D (for example, formulated milk for infants, orange juice and soy milk) are fortified with vitamin D.","Failing to eat regular or sufficient quantities of vitamin-D-containing food (for example, because of following a vegan diet) increases the likelihood of developing vitamin D deficiency. Even with a vitamin-D-rich diet, it is not usually possible for a person to maintain sufficient levels of vitamin D in their body from food alone. For this reason, vitamin D deficiency is a very common problem worldwide.",Failing to source additional vitamin D from sunlight,"For some people, particularly those who ensure that their food contains vitamin D, exposure to sunlight will be sufficient for them to synthesize the rest of their recommended daily amount of vitamin D.","Many people – particularly those living far from the equator or whose lifestyles involve staying indoors and/or wearing clothes which cover most of the skin – may need to take supplements of vitamin D to meet their required daily amount. If they do not do so, this can cause vitamin D deficiency.",Diagnosis,"If vitamin D deficiency is suspected, it is important to visit a doctor in order to confirm the diagnosis, so that one can begin treatment as soon as possible and redress any problems incurred as a result of the deficiency.","It is not standard medical practice to screen symptomless people for vitamin D deficiency.

Natural animal products. Raw milk, meat and egg yolk are sources of vitamin D.
",Good to know: It is important to note that the vitamin D content of animal products will vary according to the season. Animal products contain more vitamin D during the spring and summer months because the livestock – and the plant material they feed on – is exposed to more sunlight and thus has greater potential to synthesize vitamin D.,Vitamin D supplements,"A recent evaluation of the treatment and prevention of vitamin D deficiency, undertaken on behalf of the Endocrine Society, found that most people do not achieve a sufficient intake of vitamin D from their diet and access to sunlight alone. It is therefore recommended that most people use vitamin D supplements as a means of ensuring that they reach their recommended daily intake, so as to prevent vitamin D deficiency.[10]",The recommended daily intake of vitamin D supplement for each age group is:[7],"

Vitamin D deficiency can therefore cause hypocalcemia (where the levels of calcium in the body are too low), which in turn can cause rickets and osteoporosis.","Children experiencing hypocalcemia as a result of vitamin D deficiency may exhibit additional symptoms and health problems, such as seizures or tetany (muscle spasms).[25] If you are concerned that your child, or a child you know, may be affected by vitamin D deficiency, get a free symptom assessment by downloading the Ada app.",Complications of vitamin D deficiency in pregnancy and infancy,Vitamin D deficiency is linked to a range of possible complications relating to pregnancy and the health of the pregnant person and the newborn.Complications which may arise for a pregnant person experiencing vitamin D deficiency include:[26],"
Gestational diabetes and less efficient metabolism of glucose
Bacterial vaginitis
Preeclampsia
Premature birth
Increased likelihood of needing a cesarean delivery
",Read more about Pregnancy Complications »,"The need of the developing fetus for vitamin D increases during the second half of pregnancy, when most of the bone growth prior to birth takes place. Because a developing fetus is entirely dependent on a passive transfer of vitamin D (from the pregnant person), it is important for pregnant people to ensure that their vitamin D intake is sufficient to support the needs of the fetus in addition to their own.","In newborns, vitamin D deficiency can lead to conditions including:","
Low birth weight
Rickets
Abnormal bone growth
Increased likelihood of skeletal fractures
",Breastfeeding and vitamin D deficiency,"it is important to ensure that a breastfeeding person maintains adequate levels of vitamin D to support the healthy growth of a newborn in the postnatal period. For most newborns, breast milk is their primary source of vitamin D. However, not all breast milk will contain sufficient levels of vitamin D to provide an infant with their recommended vitamin D intake (400 IU per day). If the amount of vitamin D present in breast milk is not sufficient, It is possible for infants to develop vitamin D deficiency, particularly if they:","
Lack exposure to sunlight (because of staying indoors, wearing clothing which usually covers most of the skin or living far from the equator)
Live in weather conditions with intense cloud covering
Live in a highly polluted area
","The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends) that a daily supplement of 400 IU should be given to all breastfeeding infants, to safeguard against vitamin D deficiency.","However, recent research indicates that if a mother takes a supplement with a sufficiently high concentration of vitamin D (around 6,400 IU), her breast milk will contain high enough levels of vitamin D to provide an infant with their recommended daily intake.[27] This removes the need to give a supplement to an infant directly.",Risks of vitamin D deficiency in the elderly,People with vitamin D deficiency are likely to experience ageing more rapidly than those with sufficient vitamin D intake.,"In the elderly, a deficit of vitamin D is associated with an increased likelihood that the health problems one does experience may be difficult to treat and/or result in death more likely than without a vitamin D deficiency. Among other factors, this is because elderly people who have vitamin D deficiency are also more likely to experience cognitive impairment, compromised muscle function and are more prone to falls.",Vitamin D deficiency FAQs,"Q: Does vitamin D deficiency increase the likelihood of gaining weight?
A: Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to year-round weight gain and to difficulty losing weight. People with stable and sufficient levels of vitamin D for their age and body type find it easier to maintain a healthy weight and lose weight as desired.[28] People who are putting on unwanted weight and/or struggling to lose weight despite an appropriate diet and exercise plan may be experiencing vitamin D deficiency and should consult a healthcare professional to learn if any supplements are needed.","Q: Is it possible to regrow hair in cases when hair loss is caused by vitamin D deficiency?
A: Various studies have investigated the role of vitamin D in promoting hair growth and strength and have found a link between healthy hair and sufficient levels of vitamin D. Correspondingly, hypovitaminosis D can be a contributing factor to experiencing hair loss (alopecia). However, if one experiences hair loss as a result of vitamin D deficiency, it is likely that one will need specific treatments which are designed to promote hair re-growth to replace the lost hair.","The process of replacing hair, that has been lost due to vitamin D deficiency, may involve specialised medications and/or surgery. Ensuring that one’s vitamin D intake is suitable will help to promote the effectiveness of any treatments for hair loss which a person undergoes[29] and will help to prevent further hair loss.","Q: What happens when a person takes more than their recommended daily intake of vitamin D?
A: When a person’s regular intake of vitamin D is greater than the recommended daily dose, this can result in hypervitaminosis D (vitamin D toxicity), a rare but potentially serious condition that results from having much higher than recommended levels of vitamin D in one’s body. This can stimulate the development of a range of different health complications,[30] including excessive thirst and urination, dehydration, high blood pressure, nausea and vomiting. Long-term hypervitaminosis D can result in serious problems, including cardiovascular malfunctions, calcification (hardening) of the arteries and soft tissues, and kidney problems.","Hypervitaminosis D is usually the result of taking too many supplements of vitamin D.[31] It is therefore important to consult one’s doctor before starting to use a selection of different supplementary products, so as to ensure that there is no significant overlap between the kinds of nutritional compounds that they provide. Cod liver oil, for example, has a high vitamin D content and should therefore not be taken in conjunction with any other supplementary sources of vitamin D."
,,,,,,,,,,What is vitamin K deficiency?
,,,,,,,,,,What is vitamin K deficiency?,"Vitamin K is an essential fat-soluble vitamin which is important to bone and heart health, as well as blood clotting and brain function. A deficiency of vitamin K is rare in healthy adults due to its presence in a variety of common dietary sources, including green leafy vegetables, oils and grains.","While newborn babies are particularly at risk, people of any age can develop a vitamin K deficiency, which may be triggered by a number of factors, including liver disease, malnutrition and as a consequence of taking certain prescription drugs.[1]","Vitamin K deficiency is quite rare in infants today, because vitamin K prophylaxis is routinely given to babies at birth in many parts of the world. The deficiency is more common in infants who are completely breastfed, as baby milk formula generally contains supplementary vitamin K.[2]",The main symptoms of a vitamin K deficiency include bruising easily and excess bleeding.,"A nutritionally balanced diet is normally sufficient to prevent vitamin K deficiency. If a deficiency of vitamin K does develop, it can usually be treated effectively if detected early.",Vitamin K deficiency symptoms,Signs and symptoms of a vitamin K deficiency include:[2][3],"

Stool that is bloody, dark or sticky like tar
Blood in the urine or vomit
Irritability
Excessive tiredness or sleepiness
","Good to know: If any of these signs and symptoms occur or there is any suspicion of a vitamin K deficiency, urgent medical attention should be sought.",Vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB),"Infants with a vitamin K deficiency are susceptible to vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB), also known as hemorrhagic disease of the newborn, a rare condition which stems from the blood being unable to clot.[5]","The bleeding can occur anywhere in the body, including internally, for example in the gastrointestinal tract, and brain. Bleeding into the brain is particularly common with late-onset VKDB.","If bleeding is internal, it can be extremely difficult to notice and may lead to serious complications and even death. Signs are not always obvious and may be mistaken for other conditions.[4][6]",VKDB is classified as one of three types according to when it develops:[5][10],"
Early-onset VKDB, which develops within 24 hours of the infant being born
Classic-onset VKDB, which develops within 2-7 days of the infant being born
Late-onset VKDB, which develops between two weeks and six months after birth, most commonly in babies who have not been given a vitamin K shot
","In addition to the symptoms listed above, signs of VKDB in babies may include:[4][5][6][7][8]","
Poor feeding
Low weight or difficulty gaining weight
",Good to know: Brain bleeds may cause seizures and frequent vomiting in a baby. There may also be a lump on the head that was not there before.,"If any unusual symptoms are present or vitamin K deficiency is suspected, a medical professional should be contacted immediately.","To help prevent VKDB and other potential complications of low vitamin K levels, vitamin K is routinely given by injection or orally to all infants at birth, in many parts of the world.",Risk factors for VKDB,Factors that increase an infant’s chances of developing VKDB include:[11],"
Breastfeeding. Children who are exclusively breastfed are roughly 20 times more likely to experience VKDB. This is due to the low levels of vitamin K in breast milk compared to formula milk, as well as the low levels of bacteria that help the body synthesize vitamin K. However, breastfeeding has many other benefits, and concern about vitamin K deficiency is no reason not to do it, as the routine administration of vitamin K to newborns significantly reduces the risk of VKDB.
Pharmaceuticals. Certain medication taken by the mother can increase the chances of an infant developing VKDB. These include rifampicin, isoniazid, anticoagulants and anticonvulsant agents.
Warm environments. Extended exposure to a warm environment can make late-developing VKDB more likely. Late-developing VKDB usually peaks at around 3-8 weeks.
Liver disease. There is increased risk if an infant has an unsuspected liver disease, especially alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency.
Malabsorption. An inability to absorb vitamins due to factors and conditions such as cystic fibrosis, celiac disease and long-lasting diarrhea.
",Prevention and treatment of VKDB in infants,"A vitamin K supplement should be given to the infant as soon as VKDB is suspected. In severe cases, fresh frozen plasma, a blood product containing coagulating properties, may also be administered. If an infant has lost a large amount of blood, a blood transfusion may also be necessary.","To help prevent VKDB from occurring, a vitamin K supplement in the form of phytonadione is routinely given, with parental permission, to infants after birth in many parts of the world, including the United States and United Kingdom. It is sometimes called “the vitamin K shot”, but may be administered orally. The procedure is considered safe by healthcare professionals.[1][4][12][13][14]",Vitamin K deficiency causes and risk factors,"A vitamin K deficiency can occur in people of any age, but newborn infants are particularly at risk. Vitamin K deficiency is most likely to result from a lack of vitamin K reaching the fetus before birth and the lack of vitamin K in breast milk.",Other risk factors for a vitamin K deficiency include:[1][15],"
Liver disease
Conditions that affect the body’s ability to absorb vitamin K, such as celiac disease, Crohn’s disease and tropical sprue
Biliary tract disease
Malnutrition
Certain drugs, such as coumarin anticoagulants, cholestyramine, salicylates, rifampin and barbiturates
","It should be emphasized that a vitamin K deficiency in healthy adults is rare due to the vitamin’s presence in a variety of food sources, notably green leafy vegetables, oils and grains.",Vitamin K deficiency diagnosis,Diagnosing a deficiency of vitamin K will typically begin with a physical examination by a doctor.,"If a deficiency is suspected, the next stage of diagnosis will normally be blood tests. A blood test can reveal the level of prothrombin, a clotting agent in the blood, which will be lower than average in the case of a vitamin K deficiency.","However, as low levels of prothrombin can also be symptomatic of other conditions, the diagnosis will generally be confirmed with a vitamin K injection. If symptoms subside following the injection, the diagnosis of vitamin K deficiency can be confirmed.[16]","If you think that you or a loved one might have a vitamin K deficiency, start a free symptom assessment using the Ada app.",Vitamin K deficiency prevention,"Most healthy adults are able to prevent a deficiency of vitamin K by maintaining a diet containing foodstuffs which are rich in the vitamin, such as:","
Green leafy vegetables, such as kale, chard, watercress and spinach
Oils, such as olive, cottonseed and soya bean
Grains, such as rye grain, spelt and buckwheat
","In some cases, a vitamin K supplement may be recommended for those at risk of developing a vitamin K deficiency.",Vitamin K deficiency treatment,"The appropriate treatment method for a vitamin K deficiency depends on the severity of the condition, particularly the severity of the associated bleeding, and its underlying cause.","If bleeding reaches life-threatening levels, fresh frozen plasma will be administered. In other cases, or after fresh frozen plasma has been administered, a vitamin K supplement will be administered to the person, usually intravenously or into the muscle.[1][17]",Vitamin K deficiency FAQs,"Q: What does vitamin K do?
A: Vitamin K plays an important role in keeping the bones, heart and brain healthy. It is also essential for normal blood clotting, known as coagulation; low levels of vitamin K can cause a person to bleed excessively. For this reason, it is sometimes called “the blood clotting vitamin”.[18]","Q: What is the most common cause of vitamin K deficiency?
A: Vitamin K deficiency is most likely to occur in newborn infants, as a result of low levels of the vitamin being transferred from the mother to the baby during pregnancy, naturally low levels in breast milk, and the baby’s body experiencing difficulty making the vitamin on its own.","However, most newborns are given a vitamin K supplement after birth to avoid complications. Vitamin K deficiency is rare in adults, but can be caused by malnutrition, certain prescription medication and conditions that lead to malabsorption. For more information, see the section on causes above.[15]","Q: Why is vitamin K deficiency rare in adults?
A: Low levels of vitamin K are rare in healthy adults because it is easy to obtain sufficient quantities of the vitamin by eating a balanced diet, and the body is able to produce some vitamin K on its own.[15]","Q: What foods are high in vitamin K?
A: Examples of good sources of vitamin K include:[18]","
Green leafy vegetables like spinach, kale and lettuce
Other vegetables like brussels sprouts, cabbage and broccoli
","Q: Does vitamin K deficiency cause bruising?
A: Vitamin K deficiency can cause a person to bruise easily. However, there may be other causes of bruising. Vitamin K deficiency can also cause heavy bleeding.","If you think that you or a loved one might have signs of vitamin K deficiency, try using the Ada app to find out more about your symptoms.","Q: Can vitamin K deficiency cause anemia?
A: Vitamin K deficiency in itself does not cause anemia. However, the heavy bleeding that can be a symptom of the deficiency, may sometimes be associated with anemia. Read more about Anemia ».","Q: Can vitamin K deficiency cause hair loss?
A: Hair loss is not a symptom of a lack of vitamin K. However, hair loss may sometimes be a symptom of anemia or a deficiency of another vitamin, such as vitamin D. Read more about Vitamin D Deficiency ».","Q: How is vitamin K deficiency treated?
A: Low levels of vitamin K in adults can often be treated with dietary changes to include more leafy green and other vegetables.

,,,,,,,,,,What is a white blood cell (WBC) count?
,,,,,,,,,,What is a white blood cell (WBC) count?,"Healthy blood contains a certain percentage of white blood cells (WBCs, leukocytes or leucocytes) which, as part of the body’s immune system, help the body fight infection.[1] A white blood cell (WBC) count measures the amount of white blood cells in a sample of a person’s blood. The number of white blood cells in the body differs between individuals or at different ages in their lives. The normal range for a white blood cell count in a healthy adult is between 4,000 and 11,000 WBCs per microliter (μl or mcL) or cubic millimeter (mm3) of blood, though this may differ between males and females, and healthy children and young people usually have more.","To measure the number of white blood cells in a person’s body, a doctor will order a white blood cell count, often as part of a complete blood count (CBC) test. A low white blood cell count can indicate conditions including infections, inflammation, certain cancers, HIV/AIDS, and others, making it an important diagnostic test. Aside from these conditions, a person’s white blood cell count can indicate their immune system activity, response to cancer treatment and overall health.",White blood cells (WBCs),"There are several kinds of white blood cells (WBCs), including neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes and basophils. Each variety plays a different role in protecting the body from foreign pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites. White blood cells also defend the body from allergens, mutated cells, such as cancer, and foreign matter, such as splinters, and remove dead cells, old red blood cells and other debris.[1]","A white blood cell count checks both the overall levels of white blood cells in the blood, as well as the overall proportion of different types of white blood cells.",Low white blood cell (WBC) count,"The threshold for a low white blood cell count (leukopenia) varies between individuals and cases, but is generally considered to be anything lower than 4,000 white blood cells per μl of blood in an adult.

A: Yes, there are two main types of cancer associated with WBCs: leukemia and lymphoma. Leukemia is a cancer found in the blood and bone marrow which is caused by the rapid production of abnormal WBCs. These abnormal cells impair the body’s ability to fight infection, as well as the ability of bone marrow to produce platelets and red blood cells.[9] There are four main types of leukemia: acute myeloid, chronic myeloid, acute lymphocytic and chronic lymphocytic. Lymphoma, the second type of cancer involving WBCs, occurs when lymphocytes (small leukocytes that are part of the immune system) behave abnormally and collect in certain areas of the body. Lymphocytes can collect anywhere in the body, most commonly in the lymph nodes in the neck, armpits and groin.[10] Treatment options are available for both types of cancer.","Q: What is the relationship between bone marrow and white blood cells (WBCs)?
A: Bone marrow is the soft tissue inside the bones. It contains stem cells which can develop into WBCs, RBCs and platelets.[10]"
